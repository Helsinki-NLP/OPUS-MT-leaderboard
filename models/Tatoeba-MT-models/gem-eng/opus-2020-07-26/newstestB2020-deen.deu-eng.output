Fire extinguished in French chemical work
The big fire in a chemical plant considered particularly dangerous in the city of Rouen in the north of France has been wiped out. Normandy's prefecture announced on Friday. The fire had broken out on Thursday at night. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was used with about 200 fire-fighting vehicles.
The fire could be stopped
Anrainer was called not to leave their homes. Buildings around 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday. In the chemical plant on the banks of Seine are made additives for lubricants. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the EU's so-called Seveso Directive, which prescribes particularly stringent safety requirements.
The chemical plant already provided headlines in the past - for example, when in 2013 a leak drained the gas methanethiol and the environment far-reachingly smoked according to lazy eggs. In 2015, about 2,000 litres of mineral oil was poured into the city's wastewater system after an accident.
Woman announces her job to seek 57 days after her missing bitch
For two months a woman from Washington was looking for her missing dog - and gave up her job extra. The seven-year-old Border Collie had left the hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. 57 days were missing from the bitch every trace - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I got sick," Carole King told the Daily Inter Lake. She and her husband had left Hündin Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie had disappeared. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Donner had panicked.
In the hope that Katie could still stay somewhere in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says, "She left about four or four and a half hours ago," recalls Carole King to "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie would have run out immediately. Probably a loud thunder had put the dog in panic.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings were looking for their beloved dog. However, weeks were spent. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," Carole King told the Daily Inter Lake, who announced her job as a postman to continue her search for Katie.
"The Tears Swallowed"
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King got a call: a man came in and said that Katie was in his yard. But when King arrived there, Katie had already disappeared. She looked for the neighborhood and suddenly her bitch was standing under a tree. "I just hugged her. I didn't want to let her go," King reminded herself in "Daily Inter Lake". "The tears were floating. People stopped in their vehicles, got out and hugged us. I think the whole neighborhood knew that we had found her".
Losses in the Bundeswehr: Machine guns disappear without trace
Friday 27 September, 2019
Six MG3 machine guns are still missing.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost many weapons and tens of thousands of shots of ammunition. There are also three machine guns below them. In most cases, the remains are unclear. The opposition speaks of a "fearing" extent.
With the Bundeswehr, weapons and ammunition disappear again and again - many of them so far without trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the troops have recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 weapons parts and almost 20,000 bullet ammunition. This is reflected in a list of the Federal Ministry of Defense, which reports the editorial network Germany.
According to the paper from the Office of Defense State Secretary Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one piece of weapons and 3474 shot ammunition have been re-appeared. The remaining weapons and parts of weapons include six machine guns of type MG3, eleven G3 guns, four G36 guns, six P8 guns and two P8 pistols. In addition, 30 MG3 machine guns are missing.
The extent of the loss of arms and ammunition in the Bundeswehr was "afraiding," said Martina Renner, a member of the Left Federal Bundestag. This was all the more valid since hardly anything had been recovered in the course of investigations. The Left politician spoke of a "difficult balance". Renner criticised that the listing was not recognizable as to whether under the lost ammunition also those who had been found in connection with the investigations against the federal army officer Franco A. under suspicion had been found. "And that although a supporter of Franco A. was recently condemned for possession of this ammunition," said Renner.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after its determination by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of the city of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As ship observation data from Refinitive showed, the tanker was moving and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was reported as a target port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had already been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but initially he continued in Iranian waters. From the shipping company it was said that an official notice from Tehran was to be awaited.
The "Stena Impero" was imposed on 19 July by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Hormuz Sea Road under the pretext of violating security regulations. However, it was suspected that Iran was responding to the controversial temporary fixation of an Iranian oil tanker in front of the Gibraltar belonging to the UK.
The road of Hormuz is one of the most important sea roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. A large part of the global oil export is shipped through the oceans. The tensions in the region had intensified immensely in recent months. The trade shipping has been involved in the conflict between the USA and Iran. Several incidents have occurred with tankers and drones.
Merkel appreciates the courage of the people during the Peaceful Revolution
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel acknowledged the commitment of the people in the GDR who went on the road 30 years ago during the Peace Revolution. In the autumn of 1989, courageous citizens had brought the then GDR regime into disrepute, said Merkel at a ceremony of the Thuringian CDU faction on the upcoming day of German unity in Erfurt. The chancellor reminded among other things of the occupation of the Stasi headquarters. "The state security was taken away from the horror," she said.
Musk strives for delivery record
Tesla's quarter may keep a record. Despite the delivery boom, there were last losses in the electric car group.
New York. Tesla Chief Elon Musk has given its electric car company a strong boost on the stock exchange with the prospect of new record numbers. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand was strong, so Tesla could book 110000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter. The challenge was to quickly bring the cars to the customer. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares went out of trading with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not increased for almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered well 95000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to reach its high goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers have to be produced in the current and coming quarter of the year. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is required, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the booms, there were last losses.
Riddle solved: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the big brain prevents people from ticking themselves. This is what scientists from Humboldt University in Berlin found out with the help of experiments in rats, as they announced on Thursday evening. Progress has also been made on the question of why children are so fierce about the kitzels, only to demand more.
Finally, it has also been shown why the coming of a tickling hand alone causes laughter before the touch. This lies on a deep layer in the big brain, which already causes laughter during the expectation of the kitzel.
According to the data, earlier research showed that rats react with "laughs" in the ultrasonic field when they are whipped by people. This "laugh" was mediated by the part of the cerebral cortex, which serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughing is suppressed during self - touch
So far, it has been assumed that the brain can distinguish between self-contact and contact by others - so people cannot tickle themselves. Berlin’s researchers have now found in the experiments in rats that laughter, as well as the activity of the area of the cerebral cortex in question, is suppressed during self-contact. This is also true if living beings wash themselves. During the foreign contact and tickling by the scientists, however, the activity in the brain and impulse has been increased.
But pass the self-contact and the touch by others at the same time, be the laughing also suppressed. This indicates that the brain of the rat cannot distinguish between the self-contact and the touch by others. The new findings suggested that humans cannot tickle themselves because the self-contact activates a brake in the big brain.
The rats had also been trained to tickle themselves. Thus, in the experiment they broke off this initiation sometimes prematurely, showed escape behavior or scars. This ambivalence is similar to the behavior of the children. The ambivalence of the kitzel is a behavioral reaction that is the same in rats and humans.
Disaster averted: Great Fire deleted in French chemical work
The big fire at a chemical plant in the north-French town of Rouen, which was particularly dangerous, was destroyed. The Normandy told the news agency AFP on Friday. The fire had broken out on Thursday at night.
According to the authorities, no health-threatening substances should have expired. The samples taken give no cause for alarm, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said on Friday morning at a press conference. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was used with about 200 fire vehicles.
Schools and kindergartens were closed
Residents were called not to leave their homes. Buildings around 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday.
Factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of US-Milliard Warren Buffett
In the chemical plant on the banks of the Seveso, additives for lubricants are manufactured. The factory is part of the Lubrizol company of US-Milliardary Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called EU Seveso directive, which imposes particularly stringent safety requirements.
The chemical factory already provided headlines in the past - for example, when 2013 by leaking the gas defrosted methanethiol and the environment far-reaching according to lazy eggs roch. In 2015, after an operating accident, about 2000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city's wastewater system.
Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister
The Prime Minister's sister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at the first session of the Parliament after the deadline of Wednesday evening. If the Prime Minister threatens to take the country out of the EU on 31 October without agreements, Brussels should not respond to his demands for changes to the Brexit agreement, but it is unclear how he wants to achieve that.
About Cox, who had been involved in the stay of Great Britain in the European Union, the Prime Minister said: "The best way to honor Jo Cox's memory and to restore it to one another would be to withdraw from the EU." Cox had been murdered by a right-wing extremist during the 2016 referendum campaign.
Remembering the attacks of Oslo and Utöya is revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 dead people on Saturday in Norway a memorial is revealed in honor of the victims. The monument "Jernosene" (German: the iron roses) consists of about 1,000 iron copies of roses. They recall the roses that had been placed by thousands of people in the days and weeks after the attacks in Oslo.
In the same place, the project of the artist Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is to be unveiled - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and members of the victims. Among other Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Mit are expected to open.
On 22 July 2011, right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik first set fire to an auto bomb in Oslo's government district and, following the Utöya Island, dozens of participants in a holiday camp of the youth organisation of the Social Democratic Workers' Party. 77 people were killed in the attacks.
Iran Releases British Tankers
The UN General Debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict, but now there is a problem less. The British oil tanker, "Stena Impero", held in Iran, could re-enter the sea. It could be a puzzle piece in the Iranian President Ruhani's peace plan.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" has been detained in the street of Hormus in Iran since mid-July. After the release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the Stena Bulk shipping company announced.
The "Stena Impero" had left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew now rides for medical investigations to Dubai, explained Erik Hånell. Towards noon the ship had left Iranian waters. "It's nice that it's over," he said to the Swedish TV station SVT.
The London Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the definition of the ship illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to interfere with the freedom of the sea. We are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," said a Friday communication.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had ordered the tanker to have failed to comply with the rules of the Persian Gulf on 19 July. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crew members were doing well accordingly, Hånell said. They had behaved professionally in the face of the difficult and pressing situation over the past ten weeks. The shipping company is now working to bring them back to their families as soon as possible.
The British government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar following the establishment of the "Stena Impero": a supertanker with oil from Iran was put on the chain at the beginning of July, which was supposed to have been destined for Syria. According to the delivery, the authorities rejected EU sanctions against the war country Syria. The hint of the ship had been received by the US British.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In the middle of August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Suspects, it was a trade to free the "Stena Impero", vehemently rejected London.
The road of Hormus is one of the most important sea roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. A large part of the world’s oil exports is shipped through the oceans. The tensions in the region had intensified immensely in recent months. The trade shipping has been involved in the conflict between the USA and Iran. Several incidents have occurred with tankers and drones.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear conflict between the two countries. The Americans are proposing the Iranian leadership to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. In 2018, the United States, on its own, had stepped out of the international nuclear agreement, which should prevent Iran from building an atomic bomb and at the same time end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has put pressure on the leadership of Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country in order to force a stricter and extended agreement in other areas. Iran has resisted the pressure so far.
Due to the dispute over the "Stena Impero" and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for military protection of merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani had presented a plan for security and peace in the streets of Hormus at the UN General Assembly in New York. Iran, together with the Arab Gulf States and without foreign security forces, wanted to ensure the security of the Persian Gulf shipping operations with the initiative "Coalition of Hope" for the Persian Gulf.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would be predestined to be a "war-winner". Faced with the criminal tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on Chinese producers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to reposition themselves. Financial leaders of Asian companies, who are considering shifting their production from China to another country, call India in a UBS survey as one of the preferred alternatives. Of course, this does not only have to do with the uncertainties of the Chinese-American trade war. With a huge pool of young workers and an internal market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to have created a more important role to play in the global branched production chain.
But now India itself is in Trump's focus. Devalued from Hauden in the White House as "Kingdom of Customs", America has deprived the emerging markets of 2000 products at the beginning of June. The USA blames India prohibitively for high tariffs and calls for better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of the trade wars, however, the frictions with India are merely a sideshow. America also sees the world’s largest democracy through the security-political spectacles. Delhi and Washington combine the concerns about China’s claims for power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, an American law enforcement operation against India is unlikely to take place. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just entered a second five-year term, is therefore likely to weigh in safety.
However, the problem lies in another location: the empirically hardened thesis that open markets are accelerating economic development has a difficult situation in the socialist Republic of India. Also under modes. Its reformer is primarily aimed at the bureaucratic madness that suffocated in the multi-ethnic state for too long any entrepreneurial spirit. Companies are now receiving rapid building permits for buildings. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more aggressive insolvency and bankruptcy law creates conditions for the prompt liquidation of high-debt companies.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. In India, from economic optics, much has improved in the first five modes of business. However, this does not apply in trade policy. This means that the national conservative government even created new barriers to protecting low-competitive companies from foreign suppliers internationally.
In the West, the Nimbus of the energetic reformer, who radically renews his country, depends on this impression, not least on the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows only too well what vocabulary Western managers like. In the core, however, the "India First" lawyer never resorted to a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to eliminate anachronistic processes and thus fit for global competition. Businessmen who survive thanks to the rejection of their industries are among the main voters of Modi's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and accepted this shortsighted policy.
Resettlement of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
The former French President Jacques Chirac is due to be buried in Paris next week. The former head of state will be buried on Monday at Montparnasse Cemetery in the south of the French capital, the news agency AFP reported under the name of the Chiracs family. The funeral will take place in the narrow family circle. For Sunday, a public wedding was held in Paris's disability, as media reported.
Carrying the competitors to the goal: Dabo is the first secret hero of the Athletics World Cup
The world's top has long been in the finish when the cooled Khalifa International Stadium was playing heartwarming scenes. Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to swing dangerously in the first run of the men over 5000 meters. He could hardly keep himself on his feet well 300 meters ahead of the finish, ran in an unhealthy position, as Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly hucked him down and dragged him back the last half round of the stadium into the finish. The forces reached both but still to stop the running wristwatch after the finish. As if the scene had not been curios enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same," said Dabo after the mixed zone race, when he completely unexpectedly attracted the attention of the assembled journalists. He turned out first, didn't want to talk about his heroic act. Finally, he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he noticed that this would be difficult, he only wanted to help a passionate person. And anyway, he would only be proud to represent his country, which was invited for the World Cup by the World Cup. Under normal circumstances he wouldn't even have to start. "So I'm proud to run here for my country," he said.
In the evening, he did so with a great deal of emphasis - and much more intense than he would have imagined. This heroic act will remain in memory. Zumal Dabo even left his competitor Busby in the finish and voluntarily took the last place - by the way, well five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this lead. In the end, it had nothing to do with it, because the busby that came into the finish only with much help was disqualified by the World Athletics Association.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies there in Lisbon, came to set up a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, though at 18:10.87 minutes, he himself was disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. Under 18 minutes I was already there". However, only in training, there are no best times.
Millions of Machines: Egyptians Arm themselves for Wild Protest Day
Security measures have been strengthened in Egypt in the run-up to possible government-critical protests. On Friday in Cairo, an increased police presence was observed. Several subway stations remained closed, streets around the central Tahrir Square were blocked.
Already last day, the police had reinforced their street controls and the phones of pedestrians had partially searched for news and photos related to the protests. Hundreds had been arrested according to two non-governmental organizations.
Opponent of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura, there had been protests with hundreds of participants. They have been addressing the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critic of corruption and mismanagement. There has been no such open protest against political leadership in Egypt for years. The Egyptian contractor and actor Mohammed Ali, living in exile, who played the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, has called for a "million march" today at central places in the country. Ali calls for a "Volksrevolution" for most young Egyptians, although he is not a "good man, because he is a subcontractor for the army, but his messages arrive.
The number of arrests in connection with the protests continued to increase. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests until Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the Human Rights Organization (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. These figures could not be confirmed at first. The government also confirmed and did not comment on the figures.
Aggregately
Many people had been "willfully arrested" because "they were at the wrong place at the wrong time," HRW announced under appeal to lawyers arrested. According to her lawyers, the accusations against the prisoners range from "proliferation of false information" to membership in a "terrorist association". In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities the security forces questioned and searched in uniform, but also in civilian clothing, according to HRW figures also arbitrarily passersby.
HRW also criticised censorship in the North African country. Thus, the government blocks in Cairo websites and online services to stop further protests against Sissi.
Online dealers: Shippers should be able to return more easily
For online dealers, many returned packages are lost. Some 20 million returns land on the garbage. However, there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online retailers such as Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
While companies could not be exempted from the sales tax on donations in kind, the Ministry explained to a question of the Green Bundestag faction about which the newspapers of the Funke media group reported on Friday. However, traders could set the market value of the unsaleable returns so low that they would have to pay no or only little sales tax.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had determined that when orders are made on the Internet, every 6th package will be returned. Around four percent of the goods - some 20 million products - were then landed in the garbage. They would charge the companies additional money according to the current legal situation, because the financial authorities will assess donations in kind such as a turnover that will then be taxed on sales.
The Green faction leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt asked Minister of Finance Olaf Scholz (SPD) to make it clear with a decree that companies cannot be able to value their products and donate them free of charge to non-profit organisations. The companies should be able to rely on not to be punished for donations. This applies not only to the online trade, but also to other businesses from the fashion shop to the construction market.
Banksy art for auction: There never was a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", will be auctioned soon.
For Branczik, Banksy's work underlines "the integration of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world into the basic attitudes of animals and tribes". On Saturday, the painting will be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital until it will be auctioned on October 3rd. It will be estimated at 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Bristol Museum in the southwest of Great Britain, where Banksy lives. This year the artist had again exhibited the painting - at the same time as the original Brexit date on March 29. On this occasion, the work, formerly called "Question Time", was renamed "Devolved Parliament".
The picture could change the owner for a million dollars.
Finally, on Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, at the first meeting of the House of Commons after the lifting of a forced break imposed by Johnson by the Supreme Court, delivered a strong exchange of blows with the opposition. Johnson wants to carry out the Brexit that had already been postponed twice on 31 October, if not without agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, gets involved in the Brexit debate. In Dover in southeastern England, he painted a picture that represents a man who breaks with a chisel a star of the European flag. The work sees thousands of truck drivers and other visitors every day when entering the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a "walk in the park"
The fierce verbal attacks of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in Parliament did not contribute to a hatred climate. Compared to the 2016 Brexit referendum, the current controversy was a "walk in the park", said Dominic Cummings on Friday at a book show. "We will enjoy that. We will leave the EU and we will win."
Johnson had attacked Brexit opponents in Parliament in the past few days and accused them, among other things, of "treasoning" against the people. He accused them of being at risk to Members because they might become targets of attempted murder, he resigned as "humbug".
Cummings said that the only way to return to rest was if MEPs finally respected the British decision to leave the EU. It was not surprising that people were upset that the United Kingdom had not yet left the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the excited atmosphere, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint on Friday. "We should speak with respect", it was stated in a statement. "And we should listen too".
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for Uno intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister, Imran Khan, once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict before the UN General Assembly.
Otherwise, a new war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India was likely, Khan said on Friday at the Uno General debate in New York. "If things were going badly, one hopes for the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations would have been responsible for Kashmir. "You should have prevented this."
India and Pakistan have led three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them around the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers each dominate part of Kashmir, one of which is part of China. At the beginning of August, India had removed the autonomy status of the Indian Kashmir region and thus increased tensions in relation to Pakistan dramatically.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo demand the overthrow of the Egyptian President al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government reacts with a hard hand. It fires with sharp ammo on the population, over 2000 prisoners are joined in the prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners who are already in prison there. Protests in Egypt have never been dangerous yet. However, since the takeover of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state apparatus does everything to avoid a scenario such as the time of Arab spring.
But one of the triggers for the 2011 protests was the bad economic situation. Poverty, non-perspectivity and the feeling of being suffocated by one’s own government drove millions to the streets. And that’s a problem that the regime of el-Sisi can’t handle, no matter how hard it is against opponents. The situation has even worsened.
Today, every third party lives in Egypt below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is ten percent. Anyone who wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket has to decide who he is financing: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the repression but also the largest economic player. The military builds streets, homes, football stadiums, produce food and much more. This was the case before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes, the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, also the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. It is always critical when large parts of the population have difficulty to make a bottle of water at all.
Tüv tests in the terminal: BER-Chef: No "Showstopper" for capital airport
Two months has been examined to see if the complex interlocking system works at BER fire protection. The operators are satisfied with the progress. However, the Tüv is not yet finished at BER.
After large-scale Tüv inspections in the terminal of the future capital airport, operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is certain, said Chief of Supervisory Board Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the monitoring body.
Airport manager Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed audit, but also said that there were still deficiencies in the terminal. "We have many details, but we don't have a real showstopper." He assured that the schedule until commissioning still contains buffers.
However, there is evidence that the time reserve is not likely to be too large any more. The construction production declaration is due to be filed with the Building Office during the first quarter of 2020, which was scheduled for this autumn at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of defects in power cables are still to be addressed; the Tüv intends to examine them until February. "In order to create the conditions for taking up the operation of the flight, the Tüv needs to continue to work intensively to deal with the deficiencies," it said in a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases there are missing evidence, less about new cables. There is also no release for all the dowels on which the cable routes hang. The airport manager expects that this is available until the end of the year.
In addition, fire protection at the crossing to the station below the terminal is not yet satisfactory. The problems had already led the project into another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoking cuts that come down on a fire like a canvas so that the smoke does not spread. You drive too far down. 36 engines must be replaced therefore. Then there should be new attempts with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
The opening of the airport for years is slowed down by problems with fire protection and other beams and planning errors. Originally, it was planned to start operating in 2011. Since the start of the construction in 2006, costs have increased from two billion to approximately 6.5 billion euros for the opening of the airport next year.
Since the passenger numbers in Berlin have increased significantly since then, the managers are planning to expand the airport. Therefore, they are expected to attend a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October, as the Chairman of Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Financial manager Heike Fölster will change to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, staff manager Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. They set the airport finances on firm feet.
Chemnitz: vending machines for drugs blasted - Police arrest man
He needed money for drugs - and chased some vending machines in the Chemnitz city area into the air! Now the perpetrator is finally in custody!
Over the past two years, the number of cigarette and parking ticket machines in Chemnitz and the region has risen sharply.
After two detonations at the end of May on the Bürgerstraße and at the Further Straße in Chemnitz, a 33-year-old German was arrested by the police.
Police spokesperson Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigation for the production of explosives explosions in crime unit with particularly severe cases of theft, which were conducted by the Chemnitz police, not only this suspicion against the 33-year-olds was confirmed."
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now confessed a total of eight acts.
The police spokesperson: "With the prey, he apparently financed his anesthetic dependence." The bomber had only blown up four times between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019 parking machines on the Bürgerstraße.
The total damage caused is at least EUR 60 000!
The Automat bomber is now under investigation, and police investigations against him continue.
I think he was also responsible for other automatic explosions in Chemnitz and adjacent districts.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is implementing its strategy for Vienna Airport. Amidst the price struggle with low-cost pilots such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, Lufthansa's daughter AUA is taking over "the commercial management of all Eurowings flights from Vienna", confirmed a press speaker from Austrian Airlines to the APA on Friday. Previously, "AviationNetOnline" had reported on this.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa-Cheapest Flyer Eurowings will be de facto dissolved. Of the currently seven Eurowings aircraft, four remain in Vienna. This takes over the AUA from January 2020 in the "Wetlease", including Eurowings-Personal. In the future three Eurowings-Jets will be stationed in Salzburg, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter machines for holiday destinations. Routes from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings Base in Vienna is integrated into the AUA Cross and network planning, said the speaker. The flight times are to be adjusted on connecting flights. The aim is, on the one hand, to strengthen the Vienna Cross and, on the other hand, to expand the decentralised traffic from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, this Eurowings in Vienna only serves as "Production Company" for the Group's sister AUA. Thus, among other things Barcelona and Rome would be operated with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings device. Although the board product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, the pilots and flight attendants come from Eurowings. The Eurowings flights starting under AUA flight number will no longer be completed in Terminal 1, but as the AUA in Terminal 3.
At Vienna Airport a price struggle broke out after the Niki River. The Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion announced only on Thursday that the fleet in Vienna would increase to 16 aircraft next summer. The Irish low-cost pilot will send four Ryanair machines and crews to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetlease", which the trade union criticised as a bypass to the collective agreement.
The Battle of Ryanair Chief Michael O'Leary, who will have overtaken the AUA in five years, met Andreas Otto on Friday's AUA Board of Directors: "We will remain number one at the site, in five, six or ten years".
Queen-Enkelin Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children the Cousins were the best friends. Now the last of the four are married. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: In the Italy holidays at the beginning of the month, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) must have held the hand of his friend Princess Beatrice (31). That's what the palace announced on Thursday.
"We are extremely pleased to be able to announce our engagement. We are both so happy to start this adventure together and can hardly expect to be actually married," said the couple who have been together since October 2018 in the official announcement.
And further: "We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will help us in the coming years full of love and happiness".
Sister Eugenie cut the pictures
The official engagement photos have taken her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and also published on her Instagram account.
A royal feast
The wedding is scheduled for 2020. More information about the date, place and everything else will be announced by the palace in the coming months.
However, it is certain that the marriage of the number nine of the British throne sequence and the real estate mogul will be a celebration similar to the wedding of Eugenie on October 12, 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on causes of heart disease
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really triggers a heart failure or an attack? Hamburg researchers now want to look closely at the genetics of 9,000 healthy and sick people.
About the analysis of the genetics of 9000 people, Hamburgers and Swiss scientists want to find the causes of cardiovascular diseases in more detail.
The research project is the largest of this kind in the German-speaking region, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation supports the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland, the Davos High Mountain Hospital, which belongs to the foundation, and the Zurich University Hospital, are involved.
Excessive weight, smoking and unhealthy diet are among the major risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is not sufficiently well known. Now the scientists want to compare the entire genetics of 8,000 healthy people with the 1000 former patients of the University heart and vascular center at the UKE.
Currently, in more than 4,000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes, possible pathological changes in the DNA - so-called mutations - were known, said the clinic.
The aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure and myocardial infarction. The data could also be useful in the investigation of other common diseases, says Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University heart and vascular center. New findings on the interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidney as well as on cancer were possible.
The Chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed the firm intention to use the data for the investigation of other diseases. The hospital of the foundation in Davos has so far been dealing with allergies. Now a center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine was to be created on the medical campus there and a professorship for bioinformatics. To justify his commitment, the logistics entrepreneur living in Switzerland said that he had been operating on the open heart three years ago in Hamburg and was very grateful.
The bioassays of the healthy participants come from Hamburg, which also participates in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 subjects, according to the clinic, this is the largest local health study in the world. In the case of genetic encryption, strict respect for the protection of the anonymized data was assured by the scientists. It is a petabyte (1000 terabytes) of data, said Holger Moch of the University Hospital Zurich.
Today, according to UKE, the inheritance of a human being can be deciphered within 24 hours. The pure cost of the material was 1,300 euros. The first gene sequence worldwide, the results of which were published in 2001, cost several hundred million euros. The study is scheduled to start on October 1st, and all 9000 samples are to be analysed by the end of 2020. The first results are expected in the following year.
Nigerian police freed hundreds of mistreated boys
In Nigeria, the police have freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran school. According to instructions from residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered some minor victims, as police spokesperson Yakubu Sabo said. "The victims were abused. Some of them indicated that they had been raped by their teachers," said Sabo.
The boys had been held under the pretext of being taught in the Qur'an and "improved". Indeed, the guardians had been held by their teachers under "the most demeaning and inhumane conditions", said Sabo. About a hundred students, including children of the age of nine, had been chained in a small space.
The Koran School, according to the information, has been around ten years. Residents would have alerted the authorities to repeated irregularities in the facility. Parents would have been shocked when they were informed about the conditions in the Koran School, Sabo said. They had no idea of the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to the police.
In most Muslim North Nigeria there are many private Koran schools. They replace the often deficient state institutions. The people in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to UN refugee relief work, therefore, over the past ten months more than 40,000 people have fled across the border to the neighbouring state of Niger.
Chained and tortured: Nigeria's police released 400 children from school
Policemen in a school in northern Nigeria have liberated almost 400 students from horrific circumstances. "Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries that indicate torture," said police spokesperson Yakubu Sabo in Kaduna City.
There the children were discovered on Thursday after a note in an Islamic school. The conditions there had been "unworthy of man". The officials took the principal and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, had been held at their school as slaves and put on chains. Some had been sexually abused. Television images showed deformed and injured students in a recognizable poor state of health.
World football selection: Other allegations after Messis and Klopps Kuer
Football "Signature not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a Gala in Milan, the Fifa World Football Association is the best player, best player and best coach of the year. Lionel Messi is the sixth honor and thus record.
After Nicaragua's captain declared that he had never voted in the world football election, accusations came from other countries to the fifa. Egypt was not evaluated at all - with a curious reason.
In recent years, much of the Fifa has proved to be admirable: the World Cup awards, dubious plans of its President, Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt officials. However, the Fifa World Cup election has so far not been suspected of running out of control - if one looks at the fact that the qualified national trainers and national team captains of the member associations often agree on sympathy rather than objectively.
But after Nicaragua's captain had complained that he had not voted at all, there are still other inconsistencies: Egypt complains that the votes of National Trainer Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. In fact, they do not appear in the official and publicly visible voting list.
The Fifa apologizes for the fact that "the signatures on the electoral forms were given in capital letters and therefore not valid". One has contacted the Egyptian association several times to clarify the situation - without a reply.
Sudan’s Trainer Also Surprised
There is also an uproar from Sudan regarding the election. While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese Association states that trainers Zdravko Lugarisic did not agree as it was finally evaluated: with Lionel Messi in place one, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three. According to Fifa, however, the vote was just as received, with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese association.
The allegations had also been made by Nicaraguan Captain Juan Barrera: "Did not vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All details about my vote are wrong, thank you," he wrote. In his case, it was assumed that the Nicaraguan football association simply voted on his name.
The association now came to the announcement on Friday: Voice, but of course it was not intended. The completed electoral documents had been "immortal" with the name and the signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan election, said it in a communication from the association. However, the second captain Manuel Rosas chose. "We take responsibility for the administrative error", it was said in the communication. However, Rosas as well as the team coach Henry Duarte had voted for Messi, "all as it is in the official list of the FIFA".
The other cases allow the fifa to be examined in an investigation, but emphasizes that the election process was supervised externally by the consulting company PriceWaterhouseCoopers. So long Lionel Messi will remain the undisputed winner of the World Football Election - and Jürgen Klopp World Trainer of the Year.
Ukraine-Affair: Ranghohe Republicans speak for official investigation
Two high-ranking Republicans have spoken out openly for an official investigation against US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican Governor of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where that leads from here is determined by the facts that are determined." He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before action is taken. An impeachment procedure can lead to the resignation of the President.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations. They had shown that Trump had repeatedly invited Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to investigate the activities of the democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott, Trump Biden observed "for years".
The Republicans have so far been holding back with criticism of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair, so few have shown dissatisfaction. Scott’s comments are now a first sign of this in Trump’s party. The moderate governor of Virginia had turned against Trump’s policy several times, for example against the relaxation of environmental regulations and the tightening up of immigration regulations.
As another senior Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, also spoke out for the investigation. "It's a deeply disturbing situation," Baker said. "The right approach and responsibility for the congress is now to investigate the matter and go to the bottom of the matter."
Scott and Baker, as governor of the U.S. federal states, have not formally participated in the proceedings against Trump, which is decided in Congress. Their statements are therefore above all symbolic. However, the first senators of the Republicans have also expressed themselves critically about the situation. With Romney, for example, who represents the state of Utah in the second Chamber of Parliament, said the case was "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing".
The affair could lead to the launch of an administrative procedure against Trump, the Democrats in the House have announced an investigation, and they are proposing abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for their own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the recruitment process. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could try a so-called impeachment. The decision on an actual appointment was made in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success of such a procedure are therefore low. So far, no US President has been removed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
Were torturers on board Racketes "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily; they are supposed to have raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) had been arrested in June after she had disallowed the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees on board. After fierce protests and international criticism - also by Austrian Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted after a few days by an Italian judge.
Three men who are being accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived with the "Sea-Watch 3" in Italy. Suspects have been captured in a reception camp in Messina (Sicilians), after migrants have recognized their tormentors in Italy. "We cannot rule this out, but we have no information to do so," said "Sea Watch" spokesperson Ruben Neugebauer of the German press agency.
The police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had raped, tortured and even murdered. It was Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and subjected to atrocities - by repeated and constant physical violence", it was said in the communication at that time.
NGOs and relief organizations now point out that they can’t exactly know who comes onto the ships. “We can’t scan who the people are. They come without passports,” said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why the people of Libya are fleeing. It is therefore quite likely that there are also perpetrators on the ships. “It is therefore very important that it is followed.”
Italy's Foreign Minister Matteo Salvini immediately apologized to Rackete, who is still being investigated in Italy for aid to illegal immigration.
Musk strives for delivery record at Tesla
Tesla-Chief Elon Musk has given its electric car company a strong boost on the stock exchange with the prospect of new record numbers.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla staff published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand was strong, so Tesla could make 110,000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter. The challenge was to quickly bring the cars to the customer. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares went out of trading with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not increased for almost four months. Tesla had delivered over 95,000 cars in the second quarter and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to reach its high goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 36,000 to 400,000 cars. Six-digit numbers are required for this in the current and coming quarter of the year. Especially the most affordable Tesla Model 3 is required, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the booms, there were last losses.
US-Budget dispute: Renewal of only bridge financing
The new financial year will begin in the United States on 1 October without a proper budget. The Senate has been followed by the House of Representatives on Thursday and has decided on a transitional financing until 21 November.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August on an increase in spending limits for the financial years 2020 and 2021, the United States was once again faced with no spending plans before the new fiscal year that began on 1 October. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on a transitional financing (continuing resolution, CR) until 21 November. Without such a decision it would have come to a shut-down on Monday at midnight, a partial closure of the Federal Government. President Trump has to put the decision into effect.
Shutdown used
The Federal Government is now temporarily financed at the level and according to the priorities of the expenditure plans for the 2019 financial year ending on Monday. This is because the Congress has not been able to agree in time on the 12 spending laws that allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities. The Federal Government cannot therefore benefit for the first time from the spending framework extended for the new financial year from 1.3 Bio. to 1.4 Bio. $.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority. However, the spending laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the Senate dominated by Republicans. Conversely, the Senate has also more or less prepared ten of the twelve spending plans, which are scarcely plentiful.
The spirits differ primarily in the area of resource allocation for domestic security and border control. In the Senate the Republicans apparently try to force $12 billion for the masonry construction, one of President Trump’s major priorities. The Democrats are disturbed by the plans for the masonry and their financing, which are actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over the masonry had escalated in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
At the masonry, the spirits are separated
At present, it is unclear how the parties want to come up with this issue. More likely than a consensus on all twelve spending laws in the next seven weeks, an extension of the transitional financing beyond November 21st is not excluded.
Against the background of the ongoing inability of Congress to agree in time on the twelve spending laws, and the consequent danger of a shut-down gain ideas for automation of the process of popularity. Presentation S. 1877 to avoid shut-downs would automatically continue financing the federal government at the previous year’s level, stop the travel activity of parliamentarians and keep their wages down until the new annual spending plans are presented.
France allows artificial fertilization for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertilization is also to be open to single women and lesbians in the future: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a government legislative proposal which allows all women to use in vitro fertilization, which should increase the demand for anonymous seeds.
The presentation still needs the consent of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right camp had warned that in the future many "children without a father" could grow up. The French Bishops' Conference is also against innovation.
The new regulation is the core element of a bioethics law, which the health minister Agnès Buzyn defended as a "chance" for society. It depicts the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her idea, the cost of artificial fertilization for all women is to be borne by social insurance.
Fertilization with sperm of dead husband further prohibited
The National Assembly, on the other hand, rejected an amendment which would allow widows access to their dead man's sperm for artificial fertilization. In Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom, artificial fertilization was allowed "post-mortem". In Germany, there were cases in the past in which women complained in vain about the release of the sperm of a deceased. The opponents of the advances in Paris argued that such a progeny had a "very serious fate".
On the other hand, numerous members of the La République en Marche government (The Republic of Movement, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had expressed themselves in favour of artificial fertilization with the sperm of the deceased partner. They stressed that a widow would be imposed a "double grief" if her husband's death left her child's wish unfulfilled.
The initiators of the amendment now failed consider it unfair for a widow to be fertilized with the sperm of an unknown person in the future, but not with her own partner.
So far, artificial fertilization in France is allowed only heterosexual couples who cannot testify to children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that the limo continues to be banned.
In Germany, artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - but it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Climate compensation: Calls for Unis air tax will be louder
There is a lot to fly to the universities, so in future the country will also have a climate tax charged there. The rectors say they have no money for it, but now they are also under internal pressure.
The universities should also limit themselves to flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschulte
The discussion about climate tax on flights from universities and universities before the summer break is going up again. After the National Rectors Conference had responded sceptically to a corresponding advance from the green-black coalition, the plans now receive support from the universities. In a joint declaration, the doctoral students of six bathing-veert-temberg universities and a pedagogical university argued for compensation for service flights. This was the first step "necessary", while there had to be a broad debate on the avoidance of flights, says in their opinion. The Cabinet Decision, originally planned in July, is still on ice, because the CDU has not yet approved the presentation of the Greens.
Russia again catches North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB secret service, the prisoners should have fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. At that time, there was a shooting between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, and the fisherman later suffered his serious injuries. This time, however, there were no casualties, it was said.
The communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages, which means that North Korean fishermen were on their way in Russian territorial waters. Russia’s Coast Guards are based on their own data to protect their marine biological resources patrols.
30,000 squid confiscated
During the re-inspections, 30,000 squid had been discovered and confiscated on the boats. In addition, the data were confiscated after three fishing boats and two motor boats and taken to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok.
Russia's Fisheries Authority had not issued any fishing licenses to North Koreans even after claims by local entrepreneurs this year. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have reported that media have already been detained there for some time this year.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, has recently also complained of high ecological damage caused by North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrowly machined synthetic nets prohibited in Russia. With these small creatures would also be taken out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea where they needed 200 years to be destroyed.
In the future only 18,000: USA reduces the upper limit of asylum
The "greatest nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country in the world is taking off from those seeking protection: as the Washington Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirms, the upper limit for the legal migration of refugees is further reduced. In the future, most of the most threatened believers and Iraqi asylum is to be received.
The US government wants to reduce the already historically low threshold for the admission of new refugees again. In the 2020 economic year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, the maximum number of people will be allowed to enter the country is 18,000, as the US Department of Foreign Affairs said. In the almost overdue economic year, the limit is still at 30,000 people.
The government of President Donald Trump has drastically reduced the reception capacity of protection seekers from all over the world over the past years. Under the predecessor government of Barack Obama, much higher reception limits had been imposed.
The target ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the launch of the US refugee programme in 1980. The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs nevertheless called the US "the most compassionate and generous nation in history", a formulation that strongly recalls the use of language by the President-in-Office of the United States.
A "responsive approach" to refugees aims to enable refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild them, said Trump. For his hard course in migration policy, he gets a lot of support from supporters, but there is also massive criticism.
A major issue is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to lock down. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the national emergency. Whether there is a temporal link between the current action and the current domestic political developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selenskyj affair and a potentially threatening recruitment process.
The US government, after representation from the Foreign Office, intends to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are therefore in danger, as indicated in the statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are to receive a maximum of 1500 refugees.
The US wants to achieve that in particular people from this "north triangle" of Central America are applying for asylum in other countries. Against this background, the United States has only concluded with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras Migration Agreements to contain immigration at the US South border to Mexico.
Court orders the release of Orang-Utan from Zoo
An orang-utan weibchen has been transferred to a reception station for human monkeys in the United States at the request of Argentine justice from the former Buenos Aires Zoo. Born in 1986 in the Rostock Zoo, "Sandra", the rights of an "non-human person" were granted, so it was forced to release the animal. The animal was taken by direct flight to Dallas on Thursday evening, but not as a passenger, but in the cargo room, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53 kg of heavy human affinities are unable to adapt to life in the wilderness, they will live in the vicinity of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 other orang Utans and 31 chimpanzees, among them "Bubbles", former pet of Popstar Michael Jackson. Before entering Florida, however, "Sandra" still has to survive an approximately 40-day quarantine in the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the US state of Kansas.
"Sandra" spent several years after her birth in Rostock at the former Ruhr-Zoo in Gelsenkirchen before she was transferred to Buenos Aires in 1995. The 2014 animal conservation process around "Sandras" fundamental rights has contributed to the conversion of the Buenos Aires Zoo into an eco-park. By 2023 a research and education site is to be established there to preserve biodiversity.
Record for Swiss extreme mountaineers: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extreme climber Dani Arnold has succeeded in a new house map at the almost 3000-metre-high Great Tinne in the Italian Alps.
Without net, double ground or other aids, the Swiss forced the 550-metre-high northern wall of the Great Tin in a new record time.
Dressed with jeans, T-shirt and only supported by absolute vertigo, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the ascent. So he interrupted the old top brand by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now a record holder in the Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important European northern walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
Despite the trade conflict with China, the US sports product manufacturer Nike has recorded a significant profit increase. Net profit in the past quarter rose to 1.4 billion dollars (almost 1.3 billion euros). This is 25 percent more than in the previous year, as the Group announced on Tuesday. This is mainly due to the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", with which the Adidas competitor applies directly to its customers online.
Revenues rose to USD 10.7 billion in the three-month period until the end of August. Nike’s sales figures increased strongly with an increase of 22 percent in China. Thus, the Group from Beaverton in the US state of Oregon also benefited in the People’s Republic from its approach of direct targeting consumers via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Chief Financial Officer Andy Campion announced that Nike would continue the "digital transformation" of the sports product manufacturer with strategic investments to expand its competitive advantage. Investors were happy to respond to the quarterly figures – the sports product manufacturer's shares increased by more than five percent.
Lifelong Stadium Ban on Racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about football professional Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the association from the Italian capital has imposed a lifelong ban on a fan. The defender Jesus from Brazil was accused of Instagram by the fan. Jesus then published the private news and asked his club to take action. "@ofificialasroma You already know what to do with such a fan. #NoToRacism. Proud to be who I am," wrote the 28-year-old who plays at AS Rome since 2016.
The club responded on late Thursday. He reported the fan’s account to Instagram and the police. In addition, the Roma followers should never visit a game of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Regularly Italian fans are scandalizing racist attacks against black players of rival teams. "We cannot have racism in society or in sport. In Italy the situation has not improved, and that is very serious. One has to identify the responsible and throw them out of the stadiums," said Fifa President Gianni Infantino on the weekend. The reason for the statement was racist singing at the First League party between Atalanta Bergamo and AC Florence on last Sunday.
But there had also been last discussions about the supporters of Juventus Turin. The Italian authorities have now proven 38 ringing fans of Rekordmeister Juventus Turin with bans on stadiums. Four of them should not enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police announced. For the rest, bans of four to seven years apply.
The fans are in connection with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of Ultra Fan Groups in the Juventus area. Among other things, the twelve are accused of heavy extortion, money laundering and private violence. The club had taken the investigations into account last year with an advertisement.
According to Italian media reports, the ultra-conductors are supposed to be behind the black trade with tickets. They would have "controlled" the ticket trade for the fan curve and should have blackmailed Juventus employees to get to cheaper cards.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, the generation Z is political - all the seasons are thought of with catchy names. If you look at them more closely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the individual sense of life of young people?
"The crabs are coming!" This call officially launched on September 21st the crab catch at the Gucheng Lake in Gaochun, which included the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee's public relations department was announced.
Gaochun, which forms the southern foothills of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and is also home to the Chinese headquarters of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has ideal ecological conditions with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water surfaces and 50 percent fields". Gaochun's great natural environment offers its inhabitants all the conditions to become rich.
In the early 1990s, people in Gaochun have already begun cancer breeding. Over the course of time, the crab industry has developed into a powerful industry that has provided high incomes and has become an important part of Gaochun’s economic development. In recent years, Gaochun has actively developed the environment and science of cancer breeding, as well as the technology-based cancer culture. And the city has taken care of promoting more efficiency in agriculture and the income of farmers.
In recent years Gaochun has advanced a reform to "distribute power, optimize administration and public services" and with care has established the service network for "permitting under one roof, a team for prosecution, a network for services, a platform for credit granting", thereby optimising the environment for permits, services and development.
Gaochun takes full advantage of the advantages offered on the ground by connecting to southern Jiangsu and southern Anhui, and uses the development zone and its position as an international "Slow City" as a hanging sign for intelligent high-end production companies, biomedical and medical companies, energy storage and environmental protection companies, cultural and health sectors, as well as organic farming companies leading the "3+2" sector. At the same time Gaochun has encouraged the development of a national tourism area, covering all areas, and of tourist destinations of national importance. This includes the ecological and cultural resources of the Gaochun countryside, the state of the buildings for civic services and for the public service, the areas "Tourism +" and "+ Tourism" and the development of cultural tourism at a high quality level. It is worth looking forward to the future of Gaochun.
Iran-US conflict: Ruhani speaks of the end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani spoke after his return from the UN General Assembly of the United States of America of an alleged offer to abolish sanctions. In return for talks with the Tehran leadership, the United States had put an end to all sanctions, explained Ruhani on his official website.
However, U.S. President Donald Trump contradicted the Iranian counterpart on Twitter: "I wanted Iran to lift the sanctions imposed on him so that there was a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani describes the situation in this way: Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron had been present in New York and had insisted that a meeting take place. "And America says I lift the sanctions," added Ruhani. The nature of the punishments that should be terminated stood in the debate. "And they have clearly said that we lift all sanctions".
However, if this advances had not been made in an acceptable way, Ruhani criticised. In view of the current sanctions and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure", no one could predict the outcome of the negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel had met with Ruhani in New York. The background was the hope of Europeans to rescue the nuclear agreements negotiated with Iran with Russia and China. This was to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France’s President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel, expressed the hope that Ruhani would meet with US President Donald Trump on the margins of the UN General Assembly.
Heavy earthquakes near Istanbul - nearly 200 earthquakes
After Western Turkey was shaken by two earthquakes within the shortest time, the fear of a disaster grew. 34 people were injured during the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the earthquake on the previous day there have been almost 200 earthquakes, the Turkish Vice President Fuat Octay said on Friday. Thus, the concern for a disaster is growing.
14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were thus damaged. The starch earthquake 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region before Istanbul on Thursday and caused panic in the millions of metropolitan areas. Now the government wants to use a Commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul’s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is ignored again and again. Every year, poorly built houses are falling – among other things, mürbe made by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
Town planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open spaces registered in the centre as refuge sites have been built long ago. Only by the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük obsessive in August did the Istanbul Civil Engineering Chamber warn that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake-proof.
The epicenter of the earthquake of Thursday was located in the Marmara Sea in front of the district of Silivri and in about seven kilometres depth, as reported by the disaster protection authority Afad. A small aftershock took care of even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
The Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu told us on Twitter that injuries or damage had not been reported at first. The state station TRT showed people who ran out of houses in panic. Students were taken from the buildings for security reasons in the district of Silivri. Some students wept as they could see pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. Under the Marmara Sea there is a section of the so-called North Anatolic Disorder that marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian Earth Plate. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the most deadly was the earthquake in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time more than 17,000 people were killed.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of 7,1 to 7,4 might threaten strength. However, when it comes to the earthquake, it is unclear. During the earthquake on Thursday, the West of the country and Istanbul were already meeting again.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have packed so-called go-bags with all the necessities standing next to doorsteps, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth wobbles. When the next big quake comes, be unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York, eight people were injured. Some buildings had suffered minor damage. The Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments of the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Centre (Akom). According to his report, two mosque minarettes crashed in the Avcilar and Sariyer districts.
Warning of aftershocks in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users report panic. Buildings wobbled. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Phone lines had been interrupted. It had been more violent than that of Tuesday, writes a user. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Klinik, warned about post-shives via Twitter. He called on people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
The time of the quake is reported officially at 13.59 (local time). Just a few minutes after the first quake, CNN Turkey said there was an aftershock, which was declared with a strength of 4.0 on the judge scale.
Only on Tuesday had an earthquake of strength 4.6 the Turkish Marmara region was shaken - it was to Istanbul to feel. His epicenter was also located in the Marmara Sea west of the millions metropolis, the disaster protection authority told Afad already on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that caused headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later a catastrophic earthquake could occur in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually discharge itself - and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy reckons that the earthquake is now a warning. It has become more likely, he said to CNN Türk. "These could be the signs of a major earthquake," says Ersoy to the transmitter. "Before or later, the great earthquake will also come."
A few weeks ago there had been an incident - the earthquake caused great anxiety in Istanbul. In Albania, there had also been a violent earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 injured. Also on Lake Constance this year the earth had trembled.
Parliament: New fuel in Ukraine-affairs
Two brilliant documents provide for new explosives in Ukraine's affairs for possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible recruitment process, the U.S. democrats see themselves reinforced: the complaint about Trump filed by an anonymous informant and his controversial telephone address with the Ukrainian president raises important points for investigation against the president. Trump himself once again sees himself as a victim of a "witch hunt". He also doubted the credibility of the whistleblower.
USA: Airport of United Airlines locked in toilet - Flyer diverted
Because a passenger was locked in the board toil, a flight was diverted from United Airlines. The toilet door had been blocked during the flight from Washington to San Francisco in 1554, the airline announced according to US media.
With an extra-scheduled call on Wednesday evening (local time) in Denver, the woman was finally freed from the narrow cabin. She had been locked up for about an hour, the U.S. media wrote under appeal to other passengers. To continue towards San Francisco, the passengers had to change the machine.
In an online video that is supposed to come from Flight 1554 according to the US media, you can see how several people try to free the woman. "We're currently working on opening the door, ma'am. We'll get you out soon, okay?" says a man in it. The airline has apologized to all passengers. Open at first was whether the woman gets compensation.
The cockroache: inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit-Roman
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with all Brexit Chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous story "The Transformation", British success author Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book about Brexit Chaos in Great Britain.
The novel "Die Kakerlake" (Original: "The Cockroach") will appear in German on November 27, the Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) announced. In it it is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his earlier life, but is now at once the most powerful man in Britain. He sees it as his mission to put the will of the people into action and is wildly determined to let himself be stopped by nothing and no one.
McEwan was quoted as saying: "When Parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged in a critical moment, if ministers lie shamelessly like once the Soviet leaders, when in high positions Brexitians just get the disaster of a no-deal - then a writer has to ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer to this: write." By McEwan only appeared in the spring of the novel "Machines Like Me" about artificial intelligence.
Kafka's first story, published in 1915, is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and "sees himself transformed into an immense monster", is gradually excluded from family and society and eventually goes to the ground. "Ian McEwan bows down to Kafka to describe a world that is the head," it was said by Diogenes Verlag.
EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austria's railway infrastructure
11.200 Wagons in Austria and Hungary are provided with fluid brakes to reduce noise load by freight trains. In addition, sections of the railway connections between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron are modernised and electrified.
The aim is to make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions according to EU authorities' data, and the funds come from the EU infrastructure pot "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All travel stopped until 31 October
One day after his insolvency, the German tour operator Thomas Cook cancelled all the travels until and including 31 October 2019. Travel could not "be made for insolvency reasons", the company announced on Thursday evening.
Also affected are bookings made by the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which have already been paid or paid in full. As it is to travel with start from November 1, 2019, the company left open. In agreement with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure was examined.
Thomas Cook in Germany had entered the parish of the British parent group and had filed insolvency proceedings on Wednesday. The company, including Neckermann Reisen, Öger Tours and Bucher Reisen, employs about 2000 people in Germany.
Insurers want to transfer hotels immediately again
However, from this Friday hotels abroad, which are still hosting Thomas-Cook holidaymakers, are expected to receive money from Zurich insurance. According to Zurich, payments to the hotels are linked to the condition that vacationers are no longer charged for extra payments.
On the basis of booking information and without submitting separate invoices, the hotels in the resorts are now expected to receive 50 percent of outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesman from the German press agency said. "This applies immediately and under the condition that Thomas-Cook-Reisende from these hotels are not immediately required or otherwise required for individual payment of hotel invoices," said Bernd Engelien.
The insurance therefore responded to reports from hotel guests who had been forced to pay their accommodation on their own premises according to their own information. Some had to place more than 1000 Euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had strongly criticised this.
As many hotels are concerned, the insurance spokesperson will vote with the insolvent travel provider on Friday. According to information from Thursday, 70,000 Thomas-Cook-Pauscal holidaymakers from Germany were on their way. Zurich Germany has secured vacation and return travel by Thomas-Cook customers.
Insolvency administrators want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a solution for the future.
However, the payments to hotels announced by Zurich insurance only help the travellers who are currently on the move. Thomas-Cook customers who want to fly on the holiday only look bad. On the late Thursday evening, the company announced that all travel by including 31 October would be cancelled. This also applies to such bookings that are already paid.
As for travel with start-up from November 1, 2019, the company left open. In agreement with the insolvency insurance company, the further procedure would be examined. Basically, insurance Zurich is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travels is stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which can be represented by the company Kaera. Customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website about ways of refunding the travel price and assert their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroyed Sprengmine in Angola
For a long time, Prince Harry has continued the commitment of Lady Diana. In Africa he is now walking directly on the tracks of his mother.
With a blue splitter vest dressed in Angola, British Prince Harry set fire to an explosive mine and destroyed it.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust at the place of Dirico, he produced the ignition circuit in front of running TV cameras on Friday morning. At a safe distance, the explosives exploded in the Savannah countryside, without damage. Although the Halo Trust alone has destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the bloody conflict in the African country for decades, there are still more than 1,000 minefields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his African journey to Huambo, Harry wanted to walk directly on the trail of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same commander who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to take the route she was going. The pictures on which Princess Diana went through a minefield in 1997 had gone around the world. She also had support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day Africa trip since Monday, which began in the South African tourist metropolis Cape Town.
Stocking Brexit negotiations: The danger of a no-deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly stated that there will be no guarantee of a third postponement of Brexit negotiations. However, what statements have been made by the polarizing British government for an eternity of time. At the beginning of this week, the recent judgment of the Supreme Court in Great Britain floats like a Damocles sword over the blond shelf. His suspension of Parliament to be able to run its Brexit course until the date of withdrawal was cancelled. And a law adopted by Parliament obliges Johnson to extend bilateral discussions with the EU by 31 October.
Boris Johnson thinks deal is still possible
However, the pressure also does not seem to pass Johnson. Meanwhile, when visiting a hospital, he indicated that in the event of non-conformity, he supported an extension of the negotiations by the end of October:
You know, we're gonna stick to the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU by 31 October.
And best with a deal. I’m cautiously optimistic that this works.
And the time is gradually running out to Brexit dealers in Brussels. Even about six weeks ago, the EU and the British negotiators have time to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without agreements. However, the recent talks have not yet come to an end. An agreement by the end of October seems to be rather difficult to imagine. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, a further postponement of the date of withdrawal is in force. However, the opposition does not speak the words of the Prime Minister. She fears that Johnson could somehow enforce the Brexit in case of a no-deal.
US authorities: Other deaths caused by e-cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the United States has increased to twelve. Meanwhile, 805 confirmed and likely injured persons in this context, the US Health Agency announced CDC. According to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, there were already more than 900 patients, about 500 of whom confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still completely unclear. In Europe, no similar increase in lung damage is known so far. The complaints appear to be limited to users in the United States.
Fear of New Protests Growing in Egypt
The videos of Mohammed Ali have been divided into online networks millions of times. The building entrepreneurs and actors living in Spain are calling for a "popular revolution". For today's Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, to which critics are calling for corruption and mismanagement. Ali is expecting mass demonstrations with a million participants at central places in the country.
The security authorities are in any case alarmed. In the center of Cairo, an increased police presence had already been observed. Several subway stations remained closed, streets around the central Tahrir square were blocked. Already in the past days, the police had reinforced their street controls and the mobile phones of pedestrians had partially searched for news and photos related to the protests.
On September 20th, the demonstrators gathered around the Tahrir Square.
Last weekend in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura, there had been hundreds of protests with hundreds of participants. There had been no such open protests in Egypt for years. The security forces responded so hard. According to the Human Rights Organization Human Rights Watch (HRW), almost 2,000 people were arrested since last week. Many of them had been arbitrarily arrested - only because they had been "at the wrong place" in the wrong time, HRW informed prisoners under appeal to lawyers.
The organization also criticised censorship in the North African country. Thus, the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to stop further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013 after he had overthrown the democratically elected Islamic president Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been detained and partially sentenced in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs of Greenland expedition back
The Polar researcher Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday. On his arrival in the port of Hamburg, he was welcomed by the skipper Boris Herrmann, the climate activist Greta Thunberg with the racing yacht "Malizia" over the Atlantic.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs has been investigating and documenting the effects of global warming on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland over the past few months.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the Polar researcher. He has been waiting for years for the young generation to speak up. It has been known for decades that the earth is warming up. Nevertheless, many acted as if there were a Planet B.
"What happens on the sea often takes place under the exclusion of the public," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform the people about the effects of global warming and the pollution of the seas. The expedition included a drone of Greenlandic glaciers and was fished with nets for microplastics.
The Polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" in the framework of the Hamburg Climate Week. "For all of us who are concerned with the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great example," said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony. "He is a witness of the changes that have taken place in the Arctic in recent decades".
Expensive Spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid for pasta 430 Euros
430 euros for two plates Spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near Engelsburg in Rome: that seemed to be two Japanese tourists too much. The bill with 80 euros of drinking money was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered heated reactions.
"These cases harm Rome's reputation. We ask the police to consider whether this is a fraud," demanded a spokesman from Federagit, the Association of Travel Guides in Rome according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday Edition).
Prompt came the reaction of the owners of the restaurant. The Japanese women had not only ordered spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the local owner justified themselves. However, this cannot be taken from the bill. Also, a tip of up to 20 percent of the bill is normal, the landlord said.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump could have been confronted with an official procedure after the turbulent revelations of the past days, the Democrats want to examine this with their investigation in the House as soon as possible - the speech is from weeks until a decision would be taken.
At the beginning of the scandal is the telephone call with Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj. The accusation of Whistleblower, who finally brought the conversation out of concern for national security and for the democracy of the USA to the public with his complaint, is monstrous: the president has abused the power of his office to instrumentate the government of another country for an influence on the election of 2020. He has used Ukraine’s dependence with blackmail and so he wants to force them to become active against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also to be understood in the now published note of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not reflect the full text. However, the telephone call of 25 July is only an episode of a much larger story, in which the center next to Trump stands above all his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story is starting from the public's point of view in May 2019 when the New York Times of Rudy Giuliani's travel plans are reported to Ukraine. He wants to meet in Kiev with the newly elected president Selenskyj, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. "We don't mix up with a choice, we mix ourselves into an investigation of what we have the right to do," he says. He may think it's inappropriate, but "there's nothing illegal." Giuliani wants to be pursued in Ukraine for which there's hardly a basis - "because this information will be very, very helpful to my clients and could prove itself helpful to my government".
The lawyer and former New York mayors seem to have been infected with right conspiracy fantasies, which are fixed on Trump's countercandator at the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had been conspiring with players in Ukraine, critics said at the time to construct an occasion for Russia's investigations in the US. This accusation was never to be taken seriously.
This is precisely what Trump is talking about on the phone with Selenskyj in July. The version of Giuliani and the president is: The former vice president and currently promising candidates for the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Joe Biden, have pressed for the resignation of the Ukrainian general prosecutor Wiktor Schokin as Ukrainian commissioner of the Obama government. And to stop the investigation by him of the gas company in whose board of directors his son Hunter Biden was active. Biden seniorly pressured Ukraine financially to hide the corrupt machinations of his family.
In fact, the process was somewhat different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian prosecutor go, the investigations against the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. Schokin was also personally accused of deeply corrupt gestures, the US government was by far not the only Western partner who insisted on his dismissal. Moreover, the Obama government even explicitly supported investigations against the company.
Obstacles to Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users around the world report massive disturbances on Instagram and Facebook. Thus, Germany, the UK and Spain in particular are affected. On the website allusions.de, users report that Facebook has not been loading again and again since about 3.30 pm. Also Instagram reports that content could not be loaded. Also, whatsapp seems to be affected by the disorder, though not to the same extent.
Instagram and Co. more often affected by disorders
It’s not the first massive crash this year. Already in March and July, the services had been out for several hours. And as in previous cases, users also use Twitter to make their annoyance air this time.
Polish scientists rescued in the Antarctic
Three Polish scientists were rescued by the Chilean Air Force from the Antarctic ice. They were on their way by a tugboat and several miles away from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the accident - less than an hour did the Chilean rescue helicopter needed for the rescue.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9:30 we received the message, shortly before 10 o'clock we started, and good 20 minutes later we were over the tubing boat".
Poland has been operating on King George Island since 1977 the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station, 19 scientists are working there. The frozen researchers have certainly been brought back to their research station.
Attention: smartphone NOT wirelessly charging
Practical but Harmful
Inductive technology via Qi-standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since several new smartphones have just arrived on the market, which support wireless charging and sell very well - first and foremost the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to call a study from the beginning of July to remember. The wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommendable.
Higher temperature increases battery
Researchers warn about the wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the University of Warwick, this is extremely damaging to the devices. The reason for this is the much larger heat development. If you load a mobile phone normally by cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. In the case of wireless charging, even with the perfect alignment of the smartphone on the charging pad, the researchers have always measured over 30 degrees. If the mobile phone is slightly next to the coil, the temperature increases. In addition, the watt strength of the charging pad rises, which in turn drives the power consumption up.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature for battery durability is a crucial factor. Thus, each degree plays a role. When charging at higher temperatures, the battery does not only have to cope with capacity, but it does not last for as long as it lasts. Thus, the researchers recommend that you always charge the smartphone via cable. Since an battery exchange with modern smartphones is always associated with high costs, this should be a helpful tip. Apple has even increased the cost of a battery exchange once again - and for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is extremely comfortable: simply put the device on a corresponding charging path - these are now already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without annoying cable salad and laborious plug-in flour. Because Qi ( stands for inductive energy transfer) has a global standard, which includes Apple in exceptional cases, there are hardly any restrictions. Nevertheless, according to the researchers, the technology should only be applied in exceptional cases.
Everest-stau-photograph: 13 eight-thousanders in six months
A Nepalese climber has climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world, according to his own data. Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the top of the Manaslu in Nepal and thus established a record, his expedition organizer announced.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 eight-thousanders in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He once made international headlines: From him comes a viral photo of mountain climbers who are on Mount Everest Snake in the spring.
The picture of the mass barrier triggered a debate about stronger security measures on the 8848 meters high mountain and highest summit of the Earth. In May eleven climbers had died in the climb within a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the rise of the 14th eight-thousander: At present, the Chinese authorities are blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. As a reason for this, among other things, it is called bad weather. At the beginning of the week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal’s government wants to talk to China in order to allow it to ascend.
Four dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead were also a pregnant elephant cow, a police officer announced on Friday. "We suspect that the elephants were poisoned".
The four cadavers were found in a protected area near the famous and many tourists visited former Sigiriya Rock Festival. The animals were reported to be police spokesperson between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka almost 200 elephants are killed every year. The perpetrators are often farmers whose land the animals had previously kept themselves harmless. At the same time, about 50 people are killed by elephants every year. This usually happens when the animals move through the villages built near their habitat.
According to Sri Lanka, only some 7,000 elephants are still alive.
United Kingdom oil tankers leaving Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after its landing by Iran. This was announced by the news agency IRNA by the Bandar Abbas. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had ordered the tankers flying the flag of the British flag on 19 July under the pretext of misappropriating regulations of the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf.
Management of Thomas Cook in Criticism
The responsible Economic Committee of the House wants to investigate fully the conduct of the travel giant Thomas Cook. It is intended to deal with the board’s salary packages as well as the question of why the British government would not be able to contribute financially to the company that is struggling to survive. “Our interest is the oversight of the company as well as the control of external accountants,” said Rachel Reeves, Chairman of the Committee in London. “We obviously have to do it with a bad example of management greed.”
According to experts, genes are overestimated in intestinal cancer risk
The role of the genes in the family increased intestinal cancer risk has apparently been overestimated so far. Researchers from the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) Heidelberg come to this conclusion in a current study. Other risk factors such as family dietary habits are likely to weigh more heavily than previously assumed. This has consequences for calculations of the individual intestinal cancer risk, stressing the DKFZ scientists.
Elon Musk makes Tesla shares rise
This is what Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla staff published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog "Electrek". The demand was strong, so Tesla could book 110'000 orders, and it continued in Musk's newsletter.
The challenge was to quickly bring the cars to the customers. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla's shares went out of trading with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not increased for almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered well 95'000 cars and thus achieved its previous best value.
Musk needs records to reach its high goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360'000 to 40'000 cars. Six-digit numbers are required for this in the current and next quarter. Especially the most affordable Tesla Model 3 is required, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the booms, there were last losses.
Does the British government want to bypass Brexit law? Johnson withheld
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned about whether he is looking for ways of circumventing the law that was last passed by Parliament against an irregular Brexit. On a question like this, he simply told journalists on Friday that his government would uphold applicable law.
The law provides that the government should apply for a postponement of the withdrawal date should not have reached an agreement with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "Capital Act" which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. Johnson could use a procedural trick that would shift the entry into force of the law to the post-EU exit period.
Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement."
Iran seems to be driving up uranium enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rohani has increased the pressure on the European Contracting Parties in the dispute over the rescue of the historical nuclear agreement. "Unfortunately, the European states show inadequacy or a lack of willingness when it comes to concrete actions," said Rohani on Thursday at a press conference on the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York. In the event that they do not stand by their promises, he put ahead "further steps" from the agreements of the 2015 laboriously negotiated agreement.
The background is the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which, in return, contained the commitment to normalize economic relations with Tehran. In 2018, the United States stepped out of the agreement alone to force Iran to exchange with "maximum pressure" for a course change in the Middle East policy considered aggressive. The government of President Donald Trump wants to negotiate a new agreement with tougher conditions and is now putting back on tough sanctions against Tehran. Iran finally reacted with a resumption of uranium enrichment limited in the treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now also used or at least prepared for use with uranium installed in early September. According to IAEA data, Iran is also preparing the construction of more than 300 further centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans were not prepared to carry their part of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the costs and the burden of imposing US sanctions, presumed Rohani. However, there would still be further discussions that hopefully led to a solution.
Rohani further contests Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, the concentration situation changed: Germany, France and the United Kingdom followed on Monday's US assessment that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Huthi rebels supported by Iran were aware of the attack in Yemen, but what was considered a false confession by the United States. "We have nothing to do with it," Rohani reaffirmed his position on Wednesday.
"Those who make such accusations have to provide evidence of this," said Rohani. However, the European leaders in the talks with him during the UN General debate had not been able to do so. Instead, they would have only called for the rebels in Yemen not to carry out such an attack. Rohani had met with Chancellor Angela Merkel, President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in the past days.
Prior to possible talks with US President Trump, Rohani demanded that the far-reaching sanctions of the U.S. administration be lifted. He urged the Washington government to shift to a policy of "dialogue and reason".
Comet from other stars crossed through solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of the universe. That worked out first. The comet allows conclusions to be drawn from other solar systems.
What was initially just a presumption is now confirmed: An interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depth of space was baptized after his discoverer on 2I/ Borisov and has awakened the interest of astronomers around the world.
The far-facing comet was discovered on August 30 by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissow at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-constructed telescope of 65 centimeters in diameter. Monitoring by various observatories not only confirmed that it was an unknown comet but also showed that it was not from our solar system.
After 1I/'Oumuamua of 2017, 2I/Borisov is only the second interstellar object that was sighted when our solar system passed through.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get insights into a strange solar system from a nearby location before it disappears on a never-returnal view. First observations show that the interstellar comet resembles those of our own system, as the astrophysical institute of the Canarys reported. "The current velocity of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is clearly above the typical speeds of objects that surround the sun," said Davide Farnocchia of the US space agency Nasa in a communication.
According to the analysis, the comet is en route on a so-called hyperbola path that takes it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origins, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) announced. It is also responsible for the designation and categorisation of celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar tails, which were first led under catalog number C/2019 Q4, got the name 2I/Borisov, the first part of the name indicating that it is the second interstellar object discovered in our solar system.
Astronomers are lucky: In contrast to 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov was already sighted in the flight. Thus, the researchers remain for months for investigations. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," said Farnocchia. "After that, it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes by October 2020."
Several observatories have already taken the visitor to the visit. Thus, a team around Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, in a first investigation determined the diameter of the celestial object at 2 to 16 kilometers. Recordings of the Gemini Observatory on Hawaii show a clear tail of the comet.
Researchers at the astrophysics Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already gained a first so-called spectrum from the interstellar tails that offer a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object resembles that of comets of our solar system, and this indicates that their composition must be similar," said IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form themselves through similar processes as in our, de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
The discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests that these objects could open up a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, how often such trippers are still difficult to estimate. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly intercept a planned satellite mission of the European Space Agency Esa.
The agency intends to station the three-part space probe "Comet Interceptor" (German comet interceptor) at a waiting position at 1.5 million kilometres from Earth until 2028. According to Esa Science Director Günther Hasinger, it is to wait either for an unspoiled, fresh comet from our own solar system, or for an interstellar visitor such as 1I/'Oumuamua.
First landing on Beijing's new mega-airport Daxing
Just before the 70th birthday of the People's Republic, it is time: On the new mega-airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a first passenger machine of China United Airlines has landed, a special honor for captain and crew.
By 2022 approximately 45 million passengers are scheduled to be completed annually at the new airport, and by 2025 it is already to be 72 million. China’s President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion expensive project. China’s most recent prestige project is also called “Seesters” because of its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four runways to be extended to seven later and is equipped with the world’s largest automatic air traffic management system. A new metro transports passengers to Beijing’s city centre in just 20 minutes.
Even during construction, the Chinese had said several times that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been in construction since 2006, has been postponed again and again. In Beijing, on the other hand, after four years, a first passenger machine has landed.
New supersonic aircraft to fly in 2030: in four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - the British space agency UK Space Agency is dreaming of this. It should be possible to make a special engine (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which the company Reaction Engines developed from Oxfordshire for the 1930s, the U.S. broadcaster CNN quoted the agency. "This is the technology that could definitely achieve this," said agency director Graham Turnock to the station. "We are talking about the 2030s for commissioning, and the work has already progressed very much".
A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis currently takes about 20 hours. As so far as the only passenger transport super-sonic aircraft, the Concorde had covered the New York Paris-Paris route from 1976 to 2003 and used it for three to three and a half hours. In 2000 an accident occurred at the start of a Concorde at Charles de Gaulle Paris Airport, where all 109 passengers were killed. Last year, the US aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin announced plans to develop a supersonic aircraft together with the US spacecraft Nasa, the "X-Plane".
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," writes Reaction Engines, among other things, on its homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel with a speed of Mach 5 - which means five times as fast as the sound. In addition, such aircraft can also be used outside the Earth's atmosphere and thus enabled the "next generation truly reusable of cream vehicles".
Insurrection in Washington: Trump wants to track anonymous tippers in Ukraine-affairs
In Ukraine's affair of possible abuse of power by the US President Donald Trump wants to detect possible misplaces in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information," Trump said on Thursday in front of employees of the U.S. Embassy at the United Nations in New York. The data subject was almost "a spy" and in the past "a bit different" had been dealt with than today.
This was considered as an intimidation attempt against tipmakers. The event was actually not public. Several US media, however, broadcast audio recordings from the speech on Friday. Democrats responded to the President’s statement.
The Democrats in the U.S. House had announced preparations for a trial against Trump on Tuesday. Their accusations are based mainly on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence officer, who raises serious allegations against Trump and his government headquarters. On a large public pressure, the messages of the informant had been made public on Thursday.
As part of his work, the Whistleblower wants to have received information from several government staff, according to which the US President uses "the power of his office" in order to achieve that another country interferes in his favor with the US election 2020.
At the heart of the allegations is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his colleagues in office to investigate what could harm his political rival Joe Biden. This is about previous business of Biden’s son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his Sprout from Ukrainian justice. Beside the democratic presidential candidate for the 2020 election.
The Whistleblower accused the White House with a view to the Ukraine telephone service also of being protected: leading government staff would have tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under cover. As usual, an electronic textual protocol had been made. This had been removed from a commonly provided database and stored in a specially protected system after the interview of lawyers from the White House. So far, only a rough discussion protocol has been published.
The identity of the informant is not publicly known. The "New York Times" reported that it was supposed to be an employee of the CIA's foreign intelligence service.
Trump once again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of Tweets on the subject, the president wrote among other things, the "so-called Whistleblower" has spread information from the second hand, which had turned out to be inappropriate. Therefore, there might not be any tippers or spies at all.
As Trump said in New York about those who should have contributed information to the Whistleblower, however, outraged. The president of the U.S. House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, reacted worried and complained that Trump’s statement once again undermined the integrity of the government.
In the House of Representatives, several committees have been investigating Trump and his environment for months now. In the light of the Ukraine's allegations, the Democrats are now conducting investigations with new weight in order to launch a possible recruitment procedure against Trump.
"The Whistleblower gave us a roadmap for our investigation," said the head of the Secret Service Committee at the representative house, Adam Schiff. Trump attacked ship sharply, accused him of misrepresentation of things and again demanded the resignation of the chairman of the committee. Trump regularly insulted ship and had demanded its withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. government officials from the security and foreign policy sphere, who were working in the majority of democratic and republican presidencies, submitted themselves in a statement published on Friday following the inquiry by the Democrats into a possible method of recruitment. If the allegations were true, Trump would "a ruthless abuse of power" it said.
There is no exact timetable for the further procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could try a so-called impeachment procedure. The decision on an actual resignation was made in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success of such a procedure are therefore low. So far, no US President has been removed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
VW operating council: jobs are "sleaking" mined
The VW brand's plans to further reduce production costs could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe. This concerns the motor manufacturer's works council. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs from ten billion euros to two billion euros by 2023. This is supposed to save 500 million euros this year.
The "future pact" negotiated between companies and works council in 2016 already foresees the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. Basically, a workplace can only be dismantled in the car manufacturer if it is proven that the associated activities are no longer necessary. In addition, employment security applies until 2029.
However, as our newspaper now found out from works councils, jobs in production, which actually do not exist at the disposal, are "sleaking" by another way - so officially over the course. Thus, freeing regular places would often not be replaced.
In these cases, the works council does not have the possibility to force the replacement. Meanwhile, in many places, there is a lack of staff to take up the compaction of work, the concerns about the gradual bleeding out of the car plants would be greater. This also increases the fear that vehicle production could gradually be withdrawn from Germany and Europe, because it is more favourable in other parts of the world. VW only said: "An adjustment of the volume of employment is done as agreed socially sustainable along the demographic curve".
The VW brand wants to further standardise production worldwide and control new projects centrally. This also aims to reduce costs and speed up decisions - the aim is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness. Production director Andreas Tostmann said at a management conference in Berlin: "In uncertain times, especially from Brexit to the threat of trade war between the USA and China, we are well advised to make ourselves critical."
There are already successes in this way: For example, for the first time this year since 2013 the cost of production per vehicle would fall by 1.1 hours compared to the previous year. Before journalists Tostmann said that the production time for the golf course 8, which is to be presented in Wolfsburg on 24 October, is to be reduced by to 1.1 hours. Exact production time figures do not mention VW, according to information from our newspaper it is around the golf 7 round
20 hours.
In our region, the Wolfsburg plant is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. The plants Braunschweig and Salzgitter manufactured components. For Wolfsburg, VW-intern applies the rule of thumb that 800,000 cars must be built there every year, so that the plant is satisfactoryly profitable. In 2018, the utilization in Wolfsburg was only around 700,000 vehicles - due to the falling diesel demand and the problems of converting to the new consumption and exhaust gas testing process WLTP.
As production manager Tostmann announced last year, however, in Wolfsburg "perspective" should roll a million cars from the band. This should make it possible to bundle the golf production in the main plant - because the Zwickau plant will produce the golf production by refurbishment to the location for the e-car production.
In addition, SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales of Gulf and Tiguan last developed downwards. Therefore, the expectations are now resting on the Gulf 8. Despite all the efforts to build e-mobility, the Wolfsburger bread and butter car is supposed to remain for the time being.
Forced by Voodoo to prostitution: traffickers convicted
Young women from Nigeria have been sworn, dragged into the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution, and six suspected traffickers have to go to prison for this.
Six suspected human traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced in Bochum on Friday to probation and imprisonment of up to eight years and three months. The defendants had dragged young women from Nigeria into the Ruhr area and forced them to prostitution. In order to enforce their obedience, the foreign Nigerian women had to take a ritual oath in their home country before a voodoo priest.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought over the Mediterranean via tugboats with the help of Libyan locks. However, the dream of a better future was not fulfilled. In Germany, they were distributed across various brothels to deal with the alleged closing costs of an average of 25 000 euros.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the intrusion and the subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women on brothels in the process. "The work made it physically and psychologically difficult to create women," said Judge Isabel Hoffmann in the verdict. "Some were properly opposed".
The judgments are based on commercial and captive confiscation of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, payroll and heavy forced prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIM Permanent dispute with the Lufthansa Group has again threatened Ufo's flight attendant union with strikes.
Should the company not return to the negotiating table, the trade union "will inform on 14 October about the labour-related measures in the LH group," said Ufo Tarifskonteur Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and her daughter Eurowings have for months refused to conduct collective bargaining with Ufo. This also concerns the question of whether the trade union has lawfully terminated collective agreements with Lufthansa.
At this point, Ufo now sees itself strengthened following a decision by the Frankfurt Labour Court. Lufthansa wanted to see that the collective agreements were not terminated. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and checked to intervene on the other hand. "That a second court sees the matter completely differently, I consider unlikely," said the Ufo Board of Directors.
In August, Lufthansa also filed an application at the Frankfurt National Labour Court to check the status of the UFO as a trade union. The company argued that the trade union had not set up a representative board for months and was thus unable to fulfil its role as a collective partner.
Prior to this, there was a serious leadership dispute in the divisional union, during which numerous members of the board and the advisory board have resigned, including the long-standing trade union leader Nicoley Baublies. Due to the doubts about their leadership, the Ufo had suspended a pre-arranged vote on the strike of the cabin crew at Eurowings at the end of July.
Facilitated entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
So far, Saudi Arabia has not been known as an international tourist magnet. However, that is to change now. The country at the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, they want to increase the number of international and local visitors to 100 million per year, the Tourism Commission announced.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country," said Ahmad Al-Chatib, chairman of the Tourism Commission.
Saudi Arabia has so far become difficult for tourists. Visas are usually only available for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the orphan kingdom expects more revenue from the tourism business. According to its own statement, Riad wants to reduce its dependence on oil trade.
In mid-September, several rockets and drones had hit two of the most important oil plants in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country’s largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the oil field of Churais. In the following, national oil production dramatically broke in, oil prices shot up. It should take several weeks until the Kingdom’s oil production reached its old level again.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are in preparation for wedding
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding party. The model posted several party photos on Thursday (local time) in her Instagram stories, on which she can be seen in the white wedding look. Reality Star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized the People magazine in Los Angeles.
Justin posted several colorful dresses, including bananas printed on Instagram, and asked his followers: "Help me to choose my tuxedo for the wedding." According to media reports, the promi couple wants to marry ecclesial in the coming weekend.
A year ago, the Biebers gave themselves to the Yes Word in a New York State Office. There had been no major celebration at that time.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently stated that after initial problems, the two had found a common level: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't have a relationship."
Two deaths at plane crash in the Czech Republic
Two people were killed in the crash of a small aircraft in the west of the Czech Republic. The wreck had been discovered on Friday in a forest area near the town of Mecin (methine), the police reported. With the dead it was a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been looking for the machine since Thursday evening after the crew had delivered an emergency signal via GPS. In the search a military helicopter was also in use. The cause of the accident has yet to be determined. The crash site is located about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (plzen) and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of the European tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, non-sustainable wood, and the growth of cities, the International Union for the Protection of Nature (IUCN) reported on Friday in Brussels. It has examined the stocks of all 454 species known in Europe. 265 of these stocks are not found on any other continent. Of these 265 are 58 percent threatened. 66 are already at the highest level of danger and thus before extinction.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "dangerous", "highly endangered", "threatening to extinction" and "ended to "dead in nature". Overall, it lists more than 28,000 species of animals and plants worldwide as endangered.
Ebersche and Wild Roskastanie Threatened
In Germany, above all, Ebereschen (Sorbus) was threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency. "Most people are threatened because the populations are small anyway or because of the transformation or weakening of their habitats".
It also looks bad for wild Rosskastania. They have been considered "dangerous" since 2017, level two of IUCN-scale. The biggest threat is the Balkans mini-mots next to a mushroom. Since the 1980s it has spread from south-eastern Europe across the whole continent and has little natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild Rosskastania (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe to less than 10,000 examples. This assessment does not take into account the trees in cities, parks and avenues.
Species of shrubs and moss also in danger
At the same time, IUCN scientists created new European red lists for molluscs, shrubs and moss. More than one-fifth of the molluscs and moss and almost half of all species of shrubs were threatened, according to IUCN. This was mainly due to the destruction of the wild, to the introduced species, agricultural practices and climate change. Soft animals such as snails played a key role in the recycling of nutrients in the soil and was an important source of food for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many neglected and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Office. "We need to limit the human impact on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority."
Earthquake before Istanbul: 34 Victims reported
In the recent earthquake in Turkey 34 people were injured. There were no deaths according to the data. dozens of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Octay on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings were thus damaged. Since the earthquake on the day before, there have been almost 200 earthquakes. The starch earthquake 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region before Istanbul on Thursday and caused panic in the millions of metropoles.
Now that the government wants to set up a Commission to prepare the country better for the future at earthquakes, Octay announced. Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes over the past 20 years, said Istanbul’s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. Under the Marmara Sea is a section of the so-called North Anatolic Disorder that marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian Earth Plates.
One of the most severe earthquakes was one of the strengths of 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was located in Gölcük southeastern Istanbul. More than 17,000 people died.
Already on Tuesday, a quake of strength 4.6 had shaken the region around Istanbul. The authorities called the inhabitants to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira will be performing in the mid-term show
The Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the half-time show of the next American football finals Super Bowl. That’s what the singers announced at Twitter. “It won’t be bigger,” Shakira wrote to a photo of herself and Lopez. She’s incredibly excited to stand on the super-bowl stage. On February 2, 2020 it will be time in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez said she had dreamed of performing at the Super Bowl since 1996 - then she saw Diana Ross flying into the sky during the mid-term show. "Now it's even more special because the NFL is 100 years old and I'm going to perform with another Latina." They could hardly expect to "show what we girls can do on the biggest stage in the world".
Shakira pointed out in a statement that she felt honored to be standing on one of the biggest stages in the world and to represent Latinos and Latinas from the USA and the whole world. "And then also at my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter, it was the first time that the two "kingdoms" were standing together on a stage.
Shakira comes from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents come from Puerto Rico.
Fight against falling viewers
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the half-time show are among the most watched TV broadcasts in the USA. Even if you have recently dropped viewers: In February, the spectacle in the USA attracted the least viewers for more than ten years. Nevertheless, there were still almost a hundred million people on average.
In the run-up to the half-time show of the last Super Bowl, there had been riots: In the battle for dealing with Quarterback Colin Kaepernick last February, media reports said that top stars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not appear. Finally, the Popgruppe Maroon 5 led the half-time show - the reviews were little friendly.
Kaepernick, then Quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, had been kneeling in front of NFL games at the 2016/17 national anthem from protest against police violence and racism. With his protest, Kaepernick triggered a movement, many players took over the gestures. This caused great excitement, US President Donald Trump attacked the most African American football stars sharply. Kaepernick himself has been uncooperative since March 2017 and has no longer contested NFL party. He urges the associations not to hire him for political reasons.
Cook care: hotels get money from the insurance
Some banks are expected to face up to the expenses of the travel provider Thomas Cook according to a press report. It threatens high subscriptions to outstanding bonds and loans. This also affected Credit Suisse, writes the "Financial Times" in her issue of Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse would probably have to make overall depreciations of up to 1.8 billion pounds (about 2 billion euros) on their books, according to the report. That would have shown estimates from the advisory firm AlixPartners.
The creditors of bonds would have to purchase depreciations of between £900 million and £1 billion and the lenders between £550 and £825 million. The amounts actually written off should be more likely to be at the top of the band, an expert said the sheet.
How large the losses of creditors will actually be at the end of the insolvency process will show up. A person close to this procedure did not give too much hope. For example, the approximately 40 aircraft of Thomas Cook in the UK would be "old" and many of the properties would be in bad locations. Most of the money could be obtained with the sale of the airport slots as well as the Thomas Cook brand, it said.
Rackete is supposed to have brought suspected murderers to Italy
The Sea Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who are supposed to have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We can't rule this out, but we don't have any information on this ourselves," said the spokesman of the refugee organisation Sea Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants would have recognized the three men in Italy. They are accused of having raped, tortured and killed people in Libya. The suspected perpetrators were arrested in the reception camp in the Italian Messina. New builders stressed that the refugee organizations could not check who they left on their ships. "They come without passports".
Carola Rackete had taken illegal migrants to the port of Lampedusa on 29 June, setting up a ship of the Italian financial police. On that day, the three suspects should have arrived there too. The captain is under investigation for aid to illegal immigration.
USA warns federal government against Huawei
The head of the US Internet Administration Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, warned the federal government to trust the Chinese network equipment manufacturer Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too great," said Pai to the "Handelsblatt" with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law", which requires every company "under Chinese jurisdiction" to comply with instructions from the security agencies.
Furthermore, the current law prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests," continued the FCC Chief, making it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to ask suppliers for a "declaration of trust".
Berlin initially wanted to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "Handelsblatt" under the call for its own information.
Pai doubted that this was possible. The 5G technology consisted not only of the hardware:
Especially the software is important to keep the devices up-to-date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time," said Pai.
It is "very difficult to imagine" that a government authority, "no matter where, would be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks," continued the FCC Chief.
To the Chinese group Huawei, he makes close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The employee company, which allegedly belongs to the company, is not necessarily independent of the government," said Pai of the "Handelsblatt".
The U.S. found out that government employees were placed within the company. Pai was recently for talks in Berlin to advertise for the position of the US.
Chemical factory in Nordfrankreich burns: Schools closed
At night, residents hear explosions. A gigantic fire wall illuminates the sky over a French chemical factory in northern France. The fire is erased after hours - the cleanup work could now take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the north-French city of Rouen on Thursday the schools and kindergartens remain closed in the region.
In twelve municipalities the institutions would not open the facilities carefully on Friday, the responsible prefecture announced. The Ministry of the Interior had asked the citizens to stay as far as possible in buildings and not to be exposed to smoke. There was no harm. Farmers and breeders were invited to bring their animals inside, to protect their feed and to stop the harvest for the time being.
The fire could be completely erased on Thursday evening, as the prefecture reported. There is still a risk that smells spread after deletion, according to the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firefighters as well as 90 police officers and gendarmen were in use.
The French media reported huge flames and explosions in the Lubrizol factory, which produces additives for oils. The production plant is a few kilometres away from the city centre.
The factory in Normandy is part of the so-called Seveso category of hazardous sites, which are particularly monitored. In the Italian Seveso near Milan, a devastating chemical accident occurred in 1976.
The Prefect of the Normandy region, Pierre-André Durand, told the newscaster BFMTV that it was initially not found "high toxicity" in samples. However, a pollution of the nearby Seine could not be ruled out. In the river dams had been built against pollution, the prefecture explained.
The fire broke out in the early morning around 02.40 o'clock, the authorities reported. The cause remained unclear at first. Rouen is a regional metropolis and is located on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Minister of Finance: "Germany must invest and now"
The French Minister for Economic Affairs and Finance Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to invest more to boost economic growth in the euro area.
Germany needs to invest and now, the sooner it will be," said Le Maire on Thursday evening at the presentation of the French budget for the coming year.
The economy in the Eurozone was weakening, the minister warned.
We must not wait for the economic situation to deteriorate in order to make the necessary decisions".
Le Maire said, among other things, with a view to Germany, that action would be necessary for those states which had room for more investment.
France did not have these margins, the minister added and referred to the high debt of its country, which is more than 98 percent of the gross domestic product. The French government debt had to be "stabilised" and "reduced", Le Maire said.
Over the past few years, France has repeatedly called on Germany to make more public investment in order to revive the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly urged France to tackle its budget deficit.
The French budget for 2020 presented on Thursday foresees tax reliefs of more than nine billion euros for households.
This means that the French government is responding, among other things, to the protests of the Yellow West movement. The new debt is supposed to fall to 2.2 percent, according to expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson deviates from question about Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson strongly criticises the "Capital Act" adopted by Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law tells the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos Brexit. Critics, however, fear that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole. Addressed by this possibility, the Tory politician deviates from it.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned about whether he wants to enforce an irregular Brexit - despite the law that was last adopted by Parliament, which should prevent this from happening. On a question like this, Mr Johnson simply told journalists that his government would abide by applicable law.
The law provides that the government should apply for a postponement of the withdrawal date should not have reached an agreement with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "Capital Act" which complicates negotiations with the EU.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedural trick that would shift the entry into force of the law to the post-EU exit period. Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is by agreement".
Johnson's chief advisor Dominic Cummings explained, however, that he felt that the political struggle for Brexit was a "walking in the park" and was confident that the EU's aim was still to be met: "We enjoy it, we will win, we will (note Red.: leave the EU), don't worry," said Cummings of the British newspaper "Telegraph", according to a book presentation.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" during the 2016 EU referendum campaign, is now acting as chief strategist in the UK government seat Downing Street. He is to be behind the uncompromising policy that led the Prime Minister to an almost impossible situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of Linda McCartney's camera, which has become one of the great rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the big glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (bags) dives deep into the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to Linda in 1998 from 1969 to her death, was visibly proud and touched when he presented the videotape "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The illustrious guests included Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders-Frontwoman Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event McCartney wrote at Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a glimpse into the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration to the legacy of LindaMcCartney as a dedicated artist and the instant magic of the Polaroid film".
At Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Arizona until she found photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids made it, some hundred of them are now published in "The Polaroid Diaries" for the first time.
There are portraits, still life, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "You wanted real moments", writes art critic Ekov Eshun in his foreword. And of course, one is always at the heart of your husband Paul - as you may have never seen him before.
As he danced with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, telephoned in the bathrobe with a bag on his head or wearing unshaped moonboats. Certainly, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family who, beyond the spotlight on their farm in southern England or in Scotland, also led a normal life. So Mary McCartney said BBC said that she had slept as a baby in a bed that had stacked her father from old potato boxes. And it was tidy up at the McCartneys too.
Like hardly any other medium, the Poloraid camera captures the immediate moment. The recordings of Linda McCartney are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than pure snapshots.
It's about the deciding click: You have to recognize when a great photo happens before you. And then you have to take it in the right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you cut two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different picture." And Linda would have had the gift to always catch the right moment. "She just knew she had it," said Paul in Eshun's essay.
There the light, the composition, the picture cut-out and the colors, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes seem like abstract paintings. The perfect addition to the newly created Beatles album "Abbey Road", which appeared exactly 50 years ago.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Despite the US sanctions imposed against Iran, Turkey wants to continue to import oil and gas from the neighbouring country. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not stop oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there," said Erdogan in New York, where he had participated in the UN General Assembly.
Erdogan admitted, however, that Turkey had problems in importing Iranian oil, as some companies had "reduced due to US threats".
Nevertheless, Turkey "will continue our relations with Iran particularly on this issue and on many other issues," said the Turkish President, who had repeatedly criticised the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
Since its departure from the international nuclear agreement with Iran, the US has been pursuing a policy of "maximum pressure" towards the Islamic Republic. According to the USA, Iran pursues an atomic program in secret and does not adhere to the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the outbreak of Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran.
US government wants to restrict the reception of refugees
The US government wants to drastically restrict the reception of refugees. On Thursday, the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared that the annual ceiling for a resettlement programme should be reduced from 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, which represents an average of 40 percent.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that while the US would continue to see its commitment to support refugees, it was the most important task, however, to protect and serve US citizens. Currently, the U.S. immigration system is overburdened.
In future, the US government wants to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are therefore in danger, as indicated in the Declaration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are to receive a maximum of 1500 refugees.
In the 1980 programme, refugees from UN camps are selected from all over the world and relocated in the United States. The upper limit of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the history of the programme. Already the current upper limit of 30,000 is a low value. As the predecessor of US President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, the White House left the figure at almost 85,000.
Aid organizations were horrified to respond to the announced lowering of the upper limit. "This is a very sad day for America," said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. The United States would continue to damage its leadership role in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration into the US - legally and illegally - and the US government is expecting 350,000 asylum applications according to its own information for the next financial year.
Donald Trump - "Draws a Spice"
US President Donald Trump denounced the whistleblower affair of spying. Whoever ever accused the informant who accused him of abuse of power has given appropriate advice, “comes close to a tip”, Trump said according to a recording of a private event on Thursday in New York. That is consistent reporting several US media.
According to this, Trump spoke to the employees of the U.S. Mission. When asked about the person who informed the Whistleblower about controversial processes in the White House, he replied: "This is a tip close to it." Trump added: "Do you know what we did in old times when we were smart? Right. The spies and betrayal, we used to deal with it a little differently than we do now."
Observers appreciated the latter comment on a possible appeal to the death penalty. The Democrats strongly criticised Trump’s statements and accused him of intimidating witnesses. Furthermore, it was an attempt to hinder a congress investigation into a possible assassination procedure against him, the chairmen of the Committees on Foreign Affairs, Secret Services and Supervisory in the House of Representatives wrote.
The Whistleblower calls on the president in a now published complaint to have abused his office in order to ask for another country to intervene in the US election 2020. In concrete terms, among other things, it is his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Wolodymyr Selenskyj in the summer: In the discussion Trump suggested to him that investigations against his potential democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter be launched in Ukraine. Trump contests any misbehavior.
It is still unclear who the whistleblower is as well as its informers. However, as the New York Times reports, the whistleblower should be an analyst of the CIA's foreign intelligence service.
Refugee boat known: Baby and toddlers drown in Aegean
Again and again people try to get across the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece. There are often too small boats. Now seven migrants have died during the fall of a tugboat - including five children.
In front of the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants were killed in the fall of a tugboat. Among the victims of the deaths were also a baby and four other children, the Greek Coast Guard reported. Four children, three women and five men were thus rescued from the floods by the occupation of a passing ferry.
Among the victims should also be a lock, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had broken out of Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group of Inouss in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inouss is located between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
There are currently hundreds of migrants from Turkey to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean Sea, mostly in much too small boats. Last year, according to the United Nations (UNHCR) refugee relief work, 174 people were killed on this route.
The Who Cancels Concert
A U.S. concert of the rock band The Who has come to an abrupt end because of the inadequacy of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the show on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston, his voice failed the service. At the eighth song, Daltrey told the audience: "I think I should let it go as long as it's still running".
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend apologized and added that Daltrey "can't really speak." The audience promised Townsend to come to his expense at a restitution concert, but an appointment is not yet set.
For Friday in Dallas and for Sunday in Denver, The Who said they were going to be picked up at a later date. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only founding members left. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Renting suddenly set: WeWork lets real estate markets shake
WeWork has risen to the largest office tenant in New York.
Within a few years, WeWork rises from small startup to driving power on the world’s most expensive real estate markets. But now the company is in crisis. Owners have to fear billions of income.
The crisis of the office owner WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance on the world's largest real estate markets. The company had set off Adam Neumann as head a few days ago, shifted the planned stock exchange path and started selling subsidiaries and values such as the Privatjet for the executives to gain financial scope for the coming weeks and months. In addition, among other things, the British "Financial Times", WeWork has stopped closing new rentals with immediate effect. Thus, among other things, New York and London is the largest tenant of office space suddenly from the market.
WeWork rents large office spaces in the long term and rents them in some small units to members in the short term. This can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork burns money with this business at breathtaking speed. Last year, the company took a loss of 1.6 billion dollars, with sales of 1.8 billion dollars. This year alone, rental costs are to be increased to an estimated 2.5 billion dollars. To limit the loss, the new management is now to slow down the emergency brake and have stopped renting new areas with immediate effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now concluded leased contracts with a duration of up to 15 years, resulting in commitments of more than 40 billion dollars. These huge liabilities could not only become a problem for the company itself and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert from Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rented in Manhattan, one of the world's most expensive real estate markets, over the past 24 months, nearly 300,000 square meters of office space. WeWork's new contracts alone made sure that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the new ones at this time. Without WeWork's expansion, the office learning in the US metropolis would have risen at this time, as Alpert wrote in the "Business Insider". Similarly, in London, where WeWork is now operating several dozen office locations in the best position.
Even in the UK capital, the balance on the real estate market could move without any further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, in a office house in the centre of the financial metropolis, purchased last year by the Sparkassen Fund provider Deka for almost 100 million euros.
Many landlords have rebuilt their properties for WeWork's requirements with high investments. In spite of the long-term lease agreements, WeWork has failed to make profitable its business model soon, the real estate owners would probably have to write off some of the expected billions of revenues. Access to WeWork's reserves has not been able to do so, despite the long-term lease agreements. As a rule, the rental of WeWork's individual locations is carried out by subsidiaries, so-called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company is responsible only within close limits.
Russia again recorded numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has again taken action against North Korean fishermen. In recent days, a total of 262 wilders who had fished illegally in the waters have been arrested, according to the Interfax Agency, the Russian National Secret Service told the FSB on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Previously, the border guards were shot and three of them were injured. This time there were no casualties, it was said. The Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortage.
The North Korean fishermen were thus on the move in Russian territorial waters. Russia’s Coast Guards operate according to their own data on the protection of its marine biological resources patrols. In addition, 30,000 squid had been discovered during the re-inspections. Furthermore, the data on three fishing and two motor boats were confiscated and taken after Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok. According to Ria Nowosti, the Coast Guard in 2018 identified more than 8,000 infringements.
The Russian Fisheries Authority had not issued any fishing licenses to North Koreans, even after claims by local entrepreneurs. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been detained there for some time in 2019.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, also complained recently of high ecological damage caused by North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrowly machined synthetic nets banned in Russia. With these small creatures would also be taken from the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea where they needed 200 years to be destroyed. Also the ships themselves did not comply with the hygienic and technical regulations.
According to Moscow’s three members of the Russian Coast Guard had been injured in the arrests in the previous week. According to the FSB, a wounded North Korean also died later from his injuries. On that 17 September, Russian border guards first captured a North Korean boat and then a second one after it had opened the fire.
US entry ban against ex-President Castro
The U.S. imposed bans on the former Cuban president Raúl Castro and his children. The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs justified this in a communication on Thursday with Castro’s involvement in “gross human rights violations”. As head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean state, he presented a system in which thousands of Cubans were arbitrarily arrested and there were more than 100 political prisoners.
As Chairman of the Armed Forces, the brother of the dead revolutionary leader Fidel Castro was also acquitted of human rights violations there by the president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. "The violation of human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," tweeted US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump had issued bans on entry, among others, against members of the Venezuelan government and the military. In Venezuela, for months, a bitter power struggle has raged between the government and the opposition. The United States has imposed a series of sanctions against Maduro’s government to force him to kneel and help the opposition leader and self-appointed interim president Juan Guaidó to power.
Cuba is considered to be one of the closest allies of Maduro. The Socialist Caribbean island receives oil in exchange for the services of sent doctors. According to the US and Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous secret agents to Venezuela to help the government suppress government’s opponents.
New Climate Protests by Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protesters today, thousands of people want to go on the road again for more climate protection.
At the conclusion of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is again planning actions and demonstrations in dozens of countries around the world. Due to the shift in time, it is expected that New Zealand and Australia will start before protests cross Europe to North America. There, climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to take part in a major event in Montreal, Canada, where protesters wanted to gather in front of the White House in Washington.
How great the worldwide appeal will be on this Friday after the record participation of the previous week is relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was good things. "Last Friday over four million people have worked for the climate. This Friday we do it again!", she wrote on Twitter. So far, it has been given in the strike week 6383 actions in 170 countries, she added.
Especially in Germany, last Friday was very large. A good third of all worldwide demonstrators - around 1.4 million - had participated in protests in 575 German cities according to estimates of Fridays for Future. This time a list of the movement shows that rallyings were planned in at least 65 cities. Among them in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt, people want to go on the road for climate change.
At the age of 15 in August 2018, Thunberg had before the Swedish Parliament to call on the politicians of its country to make a stronger commitment to climate change protection. The Fridays-for-Future movement was created within a short period of time. Students and students are involved in climate protests, but increasingly scientists and other adults are also involved.
Together they demand more ambition from politics in the fight against global warming and the threat of climate change. In particular, according to the Paris climate agreement, global warming had to be reduced to less than 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial times.
Thunberg had arrived in New York about a month ago after a two-week Transatlantic Session with a high-sea race hunt. She had recently participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday she gave an emotional speech to the UN, in which she spoke intensely to the heads of state and government of the Earth. In her home Stockholm she had been addressed on Wednesday for her commitment to more climate protection of the Alternative Nobel Prize of the Right Livelihood Foundation.
Russia forbids smoking on the balcony
In future, people in Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balcony. This means a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," said a spokesman of the Ministry of Emergency in Moscow, according to Tass Agency on Thursday. The ban is due to enter into force on 1 October.
Anyone who smokes, then has to pay a fine of 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette should light a fire, then the penalty will be higher. According to the Ministry, candles are also burning. Also meat-peeling on the balcony is no longer allowed.
Hitting Cybercriminals - Investigators lift servers
In the fight against crime on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time eliminated a large server provider for illegal transactions in the darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected to have hosted numerous web sites at the Mosel via the internationally operating criminals in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach.
This was announced by the Procurator General in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday evening during a major action. The Darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
Customers of the suspects, among other things, are supposed to have been the operators of the world's second-largest Darknet drug market, "Wall Street Market", which had destroyed investigators in the spring. Also, the attack on 1.25 million Telekom router at the end of November 2016 was controlled by a server in the Cyberbunker, according to the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Such a hoster had been expelled in Germany for the first time, it was said. A web hoster provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
During the access operation with the support of special units such as the GSG9, there have been searches in Germany and abroad. They have been the result of almost five years of investigations. At noon the investigators want to inform us about more details.
New Global Climate Protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protesters today, thousands of people want to go on the streets for more climate protection.
At the conclusion of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement again planned actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world.
Protests are planned in at least 65 cities in Germany, among them in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a major demonstration in Montreal, Canada.
Climate protests - who are Thunberg's hindmen?
Righteousness and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the climate. All the more amazing that a 16-year-old girl keeps the powerman of this time in front of the mirror. But what is behind it? Is it helpful or wise marketing a climate activist? Historical master performance or manipulation tactics for his own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and brings young people up for a better climate-friendly world. Historically, it is not the first time in Europe that a young person manages to win a crowd of children and young people for himself. Already in 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne has felt excellent to work for a more just world. At that time, he has also been able to gain a crowd of young people for himself and persuades them to cross the sea in order to get to the Promised Land, just like Greta Thunberg has recently made himself on the trip to America by sailing boat.
But there is a shadow side in this respect? Why does a stock called "We don't have time" need to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers at its side. In addition, her mother has published a book that has sold far-reachingly, thanks to the daughter in the spotlight. Also old-fashioned followers of Greta Thunberg were a little dismayed over the last PR show, or the trip with the boat was probably too thick for some successors. This is also not unfounded, because the action came into play in the media worldwide and there is a lot of money flowing thanks to the impressive action.
Here are the spirits: Is it morally right to enrich themselves financially in the saving of the world? Is it still authentic if certain circles of people work together with stockbrokers during the World Rescue Action? No matter what position is ultimately taken in the matter, a critical and reflected point of view is increasingly more important in a democratically shaped society, because democracy lives on different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can make sense to question seemingly pious projects by certain trendsets critically.
Comet Discovered: Interstellar Guest Crosses Through Our Solar System
A strange comet is currently crossing through our solar system.
The assumptions of the astronomers have been confirmed: a strange comet crosses our solar system at the moment - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - Long the researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: a comet from another star crossed through our solar system at the moment. He was baptized after his discoverer 2I/ Borisov and employs astronomers around the world.
2I/Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The said body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissow on Crimea. He looked with a self-constructed telescope to heaven and further follow-ups confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that does not come from our solar system. He is only the second of his species that was sighted during transit.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to catch insights from the vicinity into a strange solar system. Apparently, the comet resembles those of our own system, as reported by the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is clearly interstellar origin and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbola that takes it out of our system.
Comet has already been sighted before approach - and can be observed for several months
But before it is so far, astronomers can observe it in detail. In contrast to his predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in his approach, which means that he can be studied from Earth for many months. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia of the US Space Agency Nasa. "After that, it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020".
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First insights about Comet 2I/ Borisov raise hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated at 2 to 16 kilometers in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body seems to be similar to our comets - because, as the IAC researcher Julia de León put it, the spectrum of the tail is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form themselves through similar processes as in our, de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
The observation, however, goes beyond individual insights. The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within just two years may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Again and again, the researchers employ the asteroids. Only recently did a giant asteroid rush past the Earth and dangerously approached it.
"Absolutely repugnant": Rachel Johnson abducted over brother
Boris Johnson is getting lonely. First his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister is bickering with clear words the war language of the Prime Minister as "savvy." It is not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "Betrug", Treaty": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and continues to equip - at least verbally. During Question Time at the Unterhaus on this Wednesday, this was due to massive outrage of the opposition, and meanwhile more critics have spoken: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told the sender Sky News, her brother, to use words like capitulation, as if the opponents of an EU withdrawal were to be "hanged, pulled, quartered, bullied and feathered". She thought it was extremely bad. She did not recognize the version of her brother again, said Rachel Johnsons, who had taken the EU Parliament elections for the anti-Brexit party "Change UK".
She was particularly concerned that her brother Jo Cox mentioned an EU-friendly lower house member who had been murdered by a Neonazi a few days before the 2016 withdrawal referendum. Their thoughts could best be honored by going through Brexit, Boris Johnson had said in the lower house. "It is very tasteless to refer to a member who was murdered by someone who called 'Britin First'," now criticized Johnson's sister. The perpetrator had obviously come from the extreme right camp who felt "enhanced by this kind of language". For all those who mourned around her, it was very unfavorable.
The widower of Cox also harshly criticized the Prime Minister. "It makes me sick when Jo's name is used that way," he tweeted. The best way to honor them is to enter passionately and decisively for what one believes - no matter what one thinks. But never should one "damonize the other side". He also complained that an atmosphere had emerged that attacks had become more likely.
Only a few weeks ago Boris Johnson, younger brother Jo, had left his post as State Secretary and his mandate as Tory Member. "I had been torn between loyalty to the family and national interest in recent months - it is an insoluble tension," explained Jo Johnson.
Johnson’s language also came up with sharp criticism in the Church. As the “Times” reports, all 118 bishops and Archbishops of the Church of England criticise the language that is “not worthy of this country”. In a common statement they stated: “In recent days, the language, both in debates and outside the Parliament, has not been acceptable. We should speak with respect to each other”.
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at the Super Bowl
In the year of its 100-year existence, the NFL is a strong sign: in the mid-term show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women perform with Latino roots, promising "an explosion of fun and energy".
Latina power at the Super Bowl: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the half-time show at the upcoming final of the US football league NFL. This was announced by the organizers on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humble, alongside JLo, to represent the Latino community, because it has incredible strength in the USA," Shakira told in a video.
The final of the American football league, which celebrates its 100th birthday next year, will take place in Miami on February 2. Many people live with Latin American roots in the metropolis of Florida’s southern tip. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is Puerto Rican origin.
"I love the Super Bowl putting two women on stage this time - and two Latinas," Lopez explained. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises for the show "an explosion of fun and energy".
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s she landed with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later published songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and is seen in the drama "Hustlers" in the German cinemas from November.
Shakira became known in Colombia as a star of a telenovela and singer. In 2001 she achieved her worldwide breakthrough with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Whereever".
The announcement of the half-time guests is expected every time in the USA. This year many are also regarded as political gestures. Finally, the country, not least through the immigration policy of President Donald Trump, is deeply divided.
The Super Bowl is the largest U.S. sports event and at the same time a huge advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones were there for fear. Usually the NFL finals watch over 100 million television viewers, it is also very popular in Germany.
Last year, political controversy arose in the run-up to last year. This was due to the dispute around the quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to take part in the national anthem while protesting against police force against blacks. Among other things, U.S. President Donald Trump had been hard approached for this. From solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had rejected a super-bowl appearance - including Rihanna and Pink. That the rock group Maroon 5 was ultimately criticized by many.
An actor and Youtuber assigns Egypt's ruler: For the first time Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men who have influence over whether blood is flowing again on the streets of Egypt have spent the last week abroad. One of them once again floated at Cairo airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. In 2013, the ex-General, who abandoned the Muslim brother Mohammed Mursi, the first freely elected head of state of the country, had spent a pleasant time in New York: U.S. President Donald Trump had praised Sisi’s action against political Islam and lost no syllabium on human rights violations at the Nile – in a week in which Egypt’s security forces arrested hundreds of people because they had dared to protest against the president. He had “no reason to worry”, Sisi said at the airport in the microphones of state television. “The Egyptians are not allowed to lead into the Irish”.
This is what the president of the other man, who is currently dedicating the events on the streets, tries to mislead Mohamed Ali. Mohamed Ali, of course, stayed abroad, where he withdraws from the access of the security forces who would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old was known as an actor only a minority of the Egyptians. Today, he is the tone-giving voice that dominates the political discourse in the cafés, the living rooms and teasing rooms of the country: With his Youtube channel "Mohamed's Secrets", Ali calls his countrymen to rise against Sissi.
He goes directly to the head of state and in quite rustic language. While the people are hungry, the president is silent in luxury and let himself build magnificent new palaces, it is said there. The army leadership, based on the Sisi rule, causes Ali corruption and enrichment. Because he made 15 years in his second occupation as a construction contractor with exactly these men's businesses, he seems to know quite exactly what he is talking about - at least that is the impression of many Egyptians, as the direct exploding click figures show.
After the last week, after Sisis's arrest after the power had demonstrated thousands against his rule, almost 2,000 citizens, among them prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested, Ali called for a "million march" for this Friday. The fact that there were really so many people on the streets was unlikely. But there were isolated minor protests, for example in Giseh near Cairo and in the place of China at Luxor. Videos showed protests in social media, whose participants threw Al-Sisi corruption and demanded his resignation. In these protests, the police also used tear gas and rubber bullets. These videos were initially not independently verified. From security circles it was said that the police had ended the protests.
From the city of Mansura in the Nile Delta, where demonstrators broke banners last week with the portrait of the president in pieces, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces built checkpoints in the city and on the highways. In Cairo, several subway stations in the city center were closed for "maintenance work", most roads around the Tarir Square, the heart of the revolution of 2011, were blocked. And on the Rabaaa Square, on which in 2013 supporters of the overthrown Muslim brother Mursi, until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure should prevent the gathering of dissatisfaction: Sisi's future party wanted to stop a major campaign for the president here.
Mohamed Ali introduced these measures to a change in his tactics: "Our goal must not be the Tahrirplatz," said Ali in Barcelona in his video camera. "Don't let us collide with police officers." But as a withdrawer, this is not to be understood: "All Egypt is the Tahrirplatz".
If the provider promises too much power
The Internet connection seems to be much slower than the provider has applied for, there are various test options.
Anyone who concludes an Internet contract does not need blindly to trust the supplier’s speed specifications. Customers can check for themselves how much of it is actually achieved in case of ups and downs.
Finally, the previously promised transmission rates are a contractual component and should therefore also be achieved, says the Consumer Centre of Bavaria.
If the connection appears to be much slower than requested by the provider, there are various test options. Thus, the measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the agreed rate.
"However, the supplier tests are carried out according to supplier-specific specifications and are therefore not calculated uniformly and objectively," says the Consumer Centre for Bavaria.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers may set a reasonable period of usually 14 days in order to produce the promised service. This is best done by interested parties in writing by filing an invitation to tender.
Even after several requests, customers can cancel and may also claim damages. However, if there is no success, the only way to do so is to help.
First Republican Investigator
As the first senior Republican, the Governor of Vermont spoke out for an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where it is leading from here, the facts are determined," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before measures - an impeachment procedure can lead to the resignation of the President.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyy to investigate interventions by the democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden in Ukraine. For Trump observed biding "for years".
Republicans have so far held back with criticism of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair; few have shown discomfort for this. Scott’s comments are a first sign of this in Trump’s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already objected to Trump’s policy several times, for example against the relaxation of environmental regulations and the tightening up of immigration regulations.
Spider-Man remains at the MCU: Further Marvel-Film Planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: At the end of August, it became known that Sony and Marvel will go separate ways in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would no longer be part of the "Avengers" universe. It was completely unclear how to continue with the films around Tom Holland.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man gets a third final film after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home" within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). That's what several U.S. media are reporting in agreement. Therefore, the movie is to be recorded: In the U.S., the film is due to start as of July 16, 2021.
The magazine "Screenrant" quotes Marvel-Boos Kevin Feige: "I am pleased that Spidery's path continues in the MCU. I and everyone at the Marvel Studios are delighted that we can continue to work on it ... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes, as Sony continues to work on his Spidery verse. You never know what the future will bring."
But how does it come to the sudden good news? It is said that Sony Marvel has offered an offer. According to industry magazines, the company Disney, also belonging to Marvel, would participate in the revenue of upcoming Spider-Man films with 30 percent. However, the news is not confirmed.
That's how Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the "Suits" finals.
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" in the USA has now arrived at the big finale. In the last episode, there were many Happy Ends and as many Cameo appearances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who participated in the series for many years, was crowned in a charming manner tribute. Attention, the following sections contain Spoiler to the finale.
One thing in advance: Duchess Meghan did not return in the finals for a last farewell greeting as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some look back once again showed the most memorable scenes with today’s Duchess. For example, the moments of the failed and the successful wedding with Mike or how she greeted him after his death imprisonment.
But also her real husband, Prince Harry, was mentioned in the "Suits" finale by mistake, in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffmann, 49) is just heading towards the altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Power, 47) makes a significant remark about his suit. Whether he has actually thrown himself over a raccoon, Harvey wants to know about the bridegroom, only to note: "Louis, you are not the prince of England."
Aegean: Baby and four other children drowning in boat accident
A baby and four other children drowned at the owner of a refugee boat in the Aegean Sea. In total, seven people died in the accident, as the Greek Coast Guard announced on Friday. The nationalities were still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousse, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men could be rescued.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently transferring to the Greek islands of the east of the Aegean Sea. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Fund (UNHCR) 174 people were killed on this route. Federal Minister of Interior Horst Seehofer has now announced that he would like to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the relevant EU Commissioner, he wanted to "inform himself in Turkey about the refugee situation," said Seehofer on Friday. He then wanted to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens in order to be able to help in the handling of the situation.
On Friday, a spokesperson of the European Commission confirmed the planned trip of Seehofers with EU Commissioner for Internal Affairs Dimitris Avramopoulos and France's Minister for the Interior Christophe Castaner.
In Greece, an unusual number of migrants from Turkey still arrive. On Tuesday alone, 654 people transferred to the Greek islands, it was said by the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection on Wednesday.
Is the Turkey deal still working?
The increased figures have raised doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey Agreement in 2016, which foresees that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants who are illegally coming to the Greek islands through Turkey. In return, the EU wanted to take up a Syrian refugee from Turkey for each of its exiled Syrians.
However, the processing of asylum applications is difficult on the Greek side. According to the Ministry of Civil Protection, Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos have barely 29 400 people. Lesbos is the worst situation: 5200 migrants are currently accommodated in a camp with 650 people.
It has never been so many since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact in March 2016, reported the Staatsrundfunk.
Climate change: Heat leads to more heart attacks
According to doctors, climate change will continue to test the health system. Climate change is "very safe" one of the biggest challenges for the health system over the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Society for Cardiology. Especially the cardiovascular system made high temperatures and high temperature rises within a short time and led to increased heart attacks. People with cardiovascular diseases, older people and diabetics are particularly affected.
Green politician has to answer for embarrassing photopanne.
The head of the Greens of Canada, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign - was the cup manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian Green Chefin holds a multi-way cup in his hand on a photo. But now came out: The cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has remained quite unnoticed for quite a long time - and finally it was noticed. Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens, never kept in his hand. On the party’s website she was seen in a photo with this cup, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had already been published and also been distributed to the media - and there was still a beak (paper) cup, as reported by the Canadian National Post.
Green Chef has to answer for photopanne
The National Post then caused manipulation before May and that the party produced Fake News to appear more credible in the topic of "environmental protection". And this in the middle of an electoral campaign to the Lower House elections, in which Trudeau too is increasingly difficult because of a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral in the social media and addressed the discussion about Fake News. A user shares a comparison of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their leaders to hide their disposable cup".
May showed herself shocked and claimed on their blog to have no knowledge of this action. To underline this, she immediately posted the original: she, in conversation with citizens, a cup in her hand. However, who put it right, she was from bamboo. She always brought it in. A spokesperson of the party said it was just about putting the party logo in the picture, and not hiding something. From the photo is only a cut-off to see on the website.
May writes that she is sorry for the employee who did this. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she says to the Guardian and at the same time asked herself something of her team: "If they want to edit a picture again, they couldn't do anything with my face, so I'm younger?"
The German Greens have also been visited because of their use of disposable plastic or air travel in Shitstorms, but their pictures were not photoshopped. Thus, the head of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, on vacation ice with plastic spoons, as reported.de*.
Influencerin wants free upgrade: Lifelong flight ban at Cathay
Jaqueline Ng is said to have been assured of an upgrade by Cathay Pacific via mail. However, when she asked to check in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontaneous get an upgrade for the Business Class - many of which dream of passengers. Sometimes they are lucky, and the employees at the check-in offer a change from the Economy Class free of charge.
However, this case shows how not to do it: A self-explained influencer actively requested the Airline Cathay Pacific to upgrade free of charge. On Instagram follow Jaqueline Ng more than 65,000 users. On May 30, she flew back from Taiwan to New York and on June 7th.
On the way out, employees refused to upgrade Jaqueline even though they had shown an email in which their Cathay Pacific allegedly provided an upgrade in view. Writing wants to have received the influencer from an airline’s marketing staff. The airline, on the other hand, accuses Jaqueline of having faked the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time the woman should have shown the same mail, but with a different reference number. The JFK airport employees were sceptical: they were following up at the headquarters. In fact, the employee from whom the mail was alleged to come should have rejected the mail contact with Jaqueline. This also confirmed the mail system in which the messages did not show up.
The airline employees at the airport canceled Jaquelines ticket and imposed a lifelong flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For 1,400 US dollars (about 1,280 euros), she had to buy a new ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests. Although Cathay had refunded her the price for her original ticket, Jaqueline also demanded the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the e-mail's metadata, the case remains clear: for Cathay, the influencer has committed fraud, it remains blocked for future flights. Airline's terms and conditions also state that they do not have to pay the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with this - and is now entering an attorney.
Oil prices give according to report on ceasefire in Yemen
Oil prices fell by more than one dollar in the shortest time on Friday afternoon. Last time a barrel (159 liters) of the North Sea Brent 61.83 US dollars cost - about 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price for a barrel of the American West Texas Intermediate (WTI) was 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.
The trigger for the course ride was a report by the Wall Street Journal on a ceasefire in Yemen. Saudi Arabia must have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
In mid-September, a drone attack on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia had brought down five percent of the world’s oil production. Huthi rebels allied with Iran in the civil war country of Yemen had announced the attacks. Saudi Arabia makes like the US government responsible to Iran. An armistice would dampen the political tension in the region.
If an agreement was actually reached, one could focus on growth and demand care, said Ole Hansen, Head of the Raw Materials Strategy Department at the Saxo Bank of Bloomberg News Agency.
Oil prices thus continue its downward movement over the past few days. One week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had cost up to nearly 59 dollars, Brent almost 65 dollars.
Finally, under Insider's call, Bloomberg reported that after the attack in mid-September, oil plant repair work in Saudi Arabia had progressed faster than expected. Consequently, the production volume had reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and moved back towards the original quantity.
Recently, there have been several press releases calling for insiders to report on rapid progress made by the state oil company Saudi Aramco in the repair work. However, raw materials experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently trying to avoid a stock exchange plan and negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after the landing by Iran and the recently issued release on the way to exit the port. The crew now prepared the departure while the ship was still under anchor, Erik Hånell told Swedish radio on Friday morning in a text message.
However, the U.S. announced that defence missiles and soldiers would move to Saudi Arabia as an archenemy of Iran. The fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the United States and Great Britain had temporarily brought oil prices up.
Suspicions Against Trump Exacerbated
In the affair of possible abuse of power by U.S. President Donald Trump, prosecuting charges against the White House have become loud. Several leading government officials would have tried intensively to prevent access to the speech at the end of July after a contentious telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj. That was an anonymous informant. The spokesperson of the representative house, the democrat Nancy Pelosi, explicitly accused the White House of "disposal". Trump spoke of a "Hexenjagd".
North Korea considers the third summit of Trump and Kim to be questionable
North Korea has expressed doubts that in the nuclear dispute it will soon come to a third summit of Maj. Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump. The meaning and the prospects for success of such a meeting are questionable due to lack of progress in the implementation of agreements of the first summit in Singapore, said top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan on Friday, according to the KCNA Agency.
The US had not done anything to implement the summit's decisions in the previous year, said the North Korean Foreign Ministry's adviser. He also criticised the US sanctions and the joint military maneuvers of the USA and South Korea. However, he hopes for a "wise" and "mute" decision Trumps to get it closer again.
Trump had said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim was supposed to bring before he explained himself. Negotiations on disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and missile program have been on the rise since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim in Hanoi in February. In June both met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states. They agreed to revive the talks, but to date they had no great success.
Prince Harry: Arms manufacturers are supposed to help mine clearance
With a blue splitter vest, the British Prince Harry in Angola symbolically set fire to a bomb mine and destroyed it. Near a camp of the British Halo Trust at the place of Dirico, he produced the ignition circuit. At a safe distance, the explosives exploded. In view of the goal of getting Angola to 2025 mine-free, he later demanded of ongoing TV cameras: "I call all the countries whose names are on these weapons, but who have not helped to get out of the way".
Pounds under pressure - interest rate reduction expected
British pound under pressure
In view of a rapid fall in interest rates, the pound is losing in value compared to the euro.
Frankfurt speculations about an early interest rate cut by the Bank of England (BoE) increase sterling's pound. On Friday, the British currency discounted up to 0.4 percent to $1.2269.
The producers of the sales were statements by the banker Michael Saunders. This one brought into the discussion a reduction in interest rates, even if a chaotic Brexit could be turned away, as the uncertainty would affect the British economy at a foreseeable time. This statement is surprising because Saunders applied as a champion of a restrictive monetary policy, said analyst Ricardo Evangelista of the Brokerhaus ActivTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burden on the economy by Brexit-Hickhack, without directly signaling a fall in interest rates. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lead his country, if not without a divorce agreement, from the EU on 31 October.
More: With his provocations, the British Prime Minister took a high risk, but it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Other Russian manipulations proved
Materials from the Moscow analytical laboratory are being manipulated - this confirms David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Taking Agency (Wada) and today's Head of Integrity of the Athletics Association.
At the start of the Athletics World Cup, new details on the doping scandal in Russia emerge - and they destroy the few credibility that the Russian sport had gained at the beginning of the year and only in a way. In January 2019, the Moscow doping laboratory finally delivered the required samples from the years 2012 to 2015 to the world anti-doping agency (Wada). Now it turned out: They were faked.
In December 2014, systematic fraud had been exposed in Russian sport. The Wada had blocked the Russian anti-doping agency (Rusada) for three years. During that time, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. After individual testing at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, the International Olympic Committee had around 270 athletes from the country under neutral flag. 168 Russian athletes were at the start of the Winter Games in February 2018. Also at the World Cups in the various sports, they were allowed to attend in the summer, even the football World Cup with the host.
No positive findings
In the following September, the Wada reopened the Rusada band, but demanded access to the laboratory and the said samples. The data should provide information on the extent of the coverage of doping cases at state baptism. They should help punish athletes later. Three months later, they were finally delivered.
The chairman of the independent AIU of the AIU of the Athletics Association (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow analytical laboratory were manipulated. "Yes, we have received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the task force has received the right data," said David Howman in the interview of the "Frankfurter General Newspaper" of Friday. "We have detected numerous discrepancies between the data that the Wada has received from a whistleblower, and those that it has received from the Russians in January". Many positive findings were missing which had been mentioned in the McLaren report.
The World Cup is not affected
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The Athletics Association holds as its only organization at the banner of Russia. At the World Cup in Doha, 30 Russian athletes start under neutral flag. They had to prove that they are training outside the Russian system and undergo tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada had already put manipulations in space and had asked Russia to respond to the accusations within three weeks. Russia is now threatening the new block of Rusada and, in the worst case, the exclusion of the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
