Food debt to European inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation in the eurozone was the rapid rise in food prices.
In the 13 eurozone countries, the trend was higher in November than expected - after 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was recorded, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts were based on only 3 percent, reported Bloomberg.
In contrast to the US, British, and Canadian central bank, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced the principal. It is felt that the interest rate reduction would facilitate the rise in raw material prices and the slight fall in unemployment.
The ECB strives to keep the inflation rate below two percent, or at least close to the two percent mark.
According to an analyst, the ECB is located in the Zwickmühle: inflation had to be "absorbed" in order to exclude later needs for action.
At 3.3 per cent, the inflation rate reached a twelve-year record high in Germany in November; in Spain the rate climbed from 3.6 to 4.1 per cent.
The increase in inflation in the euro area was responsible for rising food and energy prices.
The MATIF wheat quotations rose by 88 percent, and the price for soybeans has also reached a record high since 1973.
Food oil and dairy products were also very expensive in 2007.
The world market price for crude oil rose by 52 percent this year - last month the price per barrel of black gold reached almost 100 US dollars.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 to 2.5 per cent in 2008, but it is estimated that in 2009 inflation will decrease to 1.9 per cent.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts estimate a 3-percent inflation rate, but the annual average rate is 2.1 percent.
For 2008, experts estimate that the ECB will reduce interest rates twice.
Gallup Location Government Crisis
After long stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathizers has grown considerably by the beginning of December. For the first time since 2002, the party has the largest base camp, while the socialists have, according to Gallup, reached an unprecedented low of 13 percent.
In the case of party-faithful voters, the difference is clear thanks to the high determination of the opposition supporters: More than two thirds (71 percent) are opposed to a fifth (20 percent) vote for the MSZP.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are under the parliamentary entry gate: they reach two per cent in the total population.
The number of party voters has grown by one percent in both camps.
Compared to the last low point, the general economic sentiment has worsened further - never before was the proportion of those who judge the country's economic situation as "very bad" so high (41 percent), while another 46 percent consider it "reasonably bad".
After more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, the families see the change in their financial situation more pessimistic.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expect a further deterioration of the situation; only one tenth is expected to be improved.
A Gallup survey carried out in December showed that 71% of respondents - a historic high - judged the Prime Minister's work as "very bad than right".
Thirteen percent of respondents have great confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány in general, while the proponents for Viktor Orbán represent 38 percent.
About 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared with 27% distrust of the Fidesz party leader.
One of the indicators of political sentiment is the number of people who think that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister could be tackled even without a change of government.
If, after the unrest of last October, 35% had spoken out for the stay of the government and the head of government, this figure is only 20% today, while the relative majority (33%) sees the solution only in new elections.
Asked for their interest in the referendum, 60 percent replied that they would participate "with certainty", and another 20% would "probably" deliver their vote.
In comparison, if the parliamentary elections were to take place on this Sunday, only 55 percent would certainly go to the urns, another 15% would think their participation "probably".
74% would vote against the study fees, 79% against the practice fee, and 84% would vote against the hospital daily allowance.
Converted to the group of participants in the popular vote "with security" the shares of the opponents of study, practice and hospital fees would even amount to 81, 84, and 89 percent respectively.
Ouchan most expensive, Tesco increased by almost one-fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörser trading area also maintained this year's average price increase of 16% last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Article from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörser commercial triangle, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" also increased by 16 percent this year, but in all hypermarkets price increases of over 1,000 HUF were recorded.
After prices in the food markets have been "galoped" in last December, the rate has not been significantly reduced by percentage, compared with the already high, earlier starting level.
However, it is deterrent to consumers that what they had paid far below 9,000 HUF last year is not even available for 10,000 HUF this year.
The price of the "Napi" basket exceeded the magic 10,000 HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the investigated markets.
The highest price was 10,573 HUF.
(In 6800 the price was 6800 HUF.)
Prices for Unicum and live fish remained almost at previous year's level, while prices for powder breast fillets, walnuts and poppy have risen sharply.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but there were 1kg bread weeks for 139 Forint.
There was no competitive price fall in the product below 200 Forint.
Also surprising here was the price of a two-litre Coca-Cola pan bottle of less than 200 Forint, so the drink included a pan only cost 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, this year cut off the best price in the "Napi" shopping cart comparison, Ochan and Cora.
Our calculations have shown that Cora has increased the prices in the "Napi" shopping cart compared to the Christmas prices last year by 15, while Tesco and Ochan each increased by 18 percent.
The difference between the cheapest shopping cart of the previous year and the most expensive of today was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest shopping cart of last year and the most expensive of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was 1.480,00 HUF.
The average price increase was still at 1,206,00 Forint in the previous year, but the increase in VAT was noticeable at the prices of last Christmas.
This is precisely the process that has affected trade: it seems that the department stores could not quite decide which price range they should apply to the individual articles, since the impact of the price increase on consumption was unpredictable.
(If the dealer plans poorly for the speed of circulation of a product, it may result in significant gains in the price range which depends on the traffic intensity.)
Last year's "Napi" shopping cart was so radical in terms of measles that the most expensive basket exceeded the 2006 value by 1720 forint, whereas the price difference at the cheapest basket was only 844 forint.
This year such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost more by 1,630.00 Forint than in the previous year, and even the cheapest one, there was a price increase of 1,284,00 Forint.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic price increase was observed, the price of the daily consumer goods in the hypermarkets rose by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: for some basic foods, the Statistical Office established a more than 30% price over the period of 12 months.
So in about next to flour also in eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" basket, this seems almost impossible at the latter, as the price level of the product already expensive in the previous year has risen by hardly more than 10 percent even in the worst case.
Clearly, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the eil suppliers - at least they could turn the drastic price increase on the multis.
In the golden commercial triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain; it is constantly reported by good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores no longer look at the prices.
It is bought out of all large quantities, durable foods go in pallets over the tables.
Wednesday morning morning there were endless snakes in all three warehouses at the cash desk when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, a lower customer frequency is reported by the country, so that many multis complain about the opinion researchers that they could not even achieve the planned turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer goods.
In many places disinfectants are saved
This year more than a thousand infections were detected in hospitals due to improper handling of antibiotics.
The hygiene conditions in the hospitals, the overloading of the beds, the overloading of the staff - all factors that are not precisely acceptable to the control of the infections, so the senior physician of the National Epidemiology Centre.
In many places the disinfectants are also saved.
In the traumatology department of János Hospital, a MRSA infection was recently diagnosed.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was found in a male patient who was hospitalised after a serious accident.
The patient has been isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection here.
The victim of a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but only a little later the man had to return with a MRSA infection. Since then, an important surgery could not be performed because of the bacterium that is still in the patient's body.
Until December 10 this year, multi-resistant pathogen infections were reported from hospitals in 1094 to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, according to Karolina Bröócz, the senior physician of the National Epidemiology Centre.
So many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have been recorded in hospitals with certainty, but the dark digit should be higher.
Approximately two-thirds of the infections (683 cases) were triggered by MRSA, the staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about a third of the people in its nose without causing any disease.
SA-related infections (such as sore throat, tonsillitis, inflammation of the skin or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well curable.
However, if the substances are used too high or improperly, they are derived from the well-responsive bacteria antibiotics-resistant, which spread rapidly in hospitals under appropriate conditions.
Especially in patients with weakened, or permanently poor immune system, but also in the elderly, or in patients with low body weight, these bacteria can cause severe infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. Sepsis.
According to the medical director of János Hospital, the MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents belong to the hospital everyday life.
You shouldn't confuse the infection with the epidemic, Tibor Nyulasi warned - MRSA only doesn't exist where she's not being sought.
Resistant to antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, the nursing staff wear rubber gloves and masks in the supply, and we have the antibiotics needed for treatment" - says Tibor Nyulasi.
When they are admitted to the hospital, patients are examined for MRSA, but an infection cannot always be avoided.
Samplings too rare
The majority of infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, but the current prevailing conditions and circumstances would be unfavourable for the control of the emergence or spread of the multi-resistant pathogen, says Karolina Bröcz.
After this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and old-age homes, the hospitals should examine the patients in question and isolate MRSA-infected immediately.
In the Hungarian hospitals, however, microbiological sampling is not practised so often.
Not least because there are no grants for this investigation from the State health insurance fund.
Most cases are therefore only likely to occur when the patient already has a remarkable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the epidemiology center.
On the European Union side, there are strict recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also directives in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
Antibiotics should be targeted, that is, microbiological tests are necessary so that resistance to the drug cannot arise, but this directive is not always complied with by hospitals.
According to Karolina Bröcz, microbiological samples were even less rare among the outpatients, or patients in the primary care.
To be saved from the disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most commonly transferred from one patient to another by the caregiver.
This is precisely why hand washing, or wearing gloves and masks are of great importance, but there are also significant shortcomings in the hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by drip infection or contact, but in the home hospitals there is not always the possibility to isolate the infected patient.
The rooms are often overcrowded, the beds are tied to each other, although there should be an epidemiological distance of at least 1.5 meters between them.
As Karolina Böröcz points out, unfortunately, in the less financially well-off hospitals it is even apparent that disinfectants are saved, there are few caregivers, many patients - all the factors that favor the emergence of infections.
Such infections are shown to be much less common there, or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped where these protective measures are observed, says Karolina Bröócz.
Government programme against MRSA
Getting MRSA infections in control causes the health insurance huge costs, therefore they are fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its containment, was recorded in the government programme.
After first signs the program is successful - as published data prove, the trend of MRSA infections in England is decreasing.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has explained the prevention of the emergence of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals as one of its priorities.
Death-link police chief wasn't drunk.
In the case of car accidents with fatal outcome caused by police chief of the XXII district, the official report is now available.
The now retired police chief of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday, was neither alcoholic nor under drug influence, said Attila Morvai, the press spokesperson of the Budapest Supreme Prosecutor's Office on Friday after the official report was presented on the case.
The report confirmed the results of the initial investigation, according to which the chief of police had not consumed alcohol before he was taxed.
The former police chief bog with his own car in the XXII. district into Kossuth Lajos Straße and has crossed a 55-year-old man who crossed the street at an unmarked place.
(But this is not a humiliating circumstance for StVO - the handlebar has, even if pedestrians do not cross the road on the zebra strip, aftergang.)
The pedestrian suffered his injuries after his arrival to the hospital.
According to police reports, the handlebar suffered a shock, retired his duties, and asked for retirement.
The Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office has initiated its investigations into the incident.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police chief had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
Another EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Minister of Finance János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three credit agreements in Budapest on Friday, amounting to EUR 400 million, which is intended to cover education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for financing transport and environmental projects implemented with grants from the Cohesion Fund. The loan agreement of EUR 100 million was signed earlier, and the current agreement concerns the use of the EUR 200 million allocated.
The sum of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement is also to be devoted to the budgetary financing of education projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary; the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later on in the context of the extension of the credit agreement.
In the area of innovation, the Contracting Parties have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will mainly take place in research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
The metro line 4 was also spoken at the meeting.
It was agreed that once Hungary clarified the details of the underground financing with the EU, the original contract and any modifications will be re-examined.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects worth EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The interest on loans is EURIBOR-linked and the loan is made available free of commission by the EIB with a suspension of 8 years.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - all of Europe looks at the previously rarely mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who is still buying the cheapest market in the EU, but which is rapidly becoming more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most sought after patch for real estate purchases in the Eastern European region, with cheap ski apartments and houses on the sea.
Between the mountains the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, by the sea are Albena, the "gold coast", the "sun-coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Neessbar the racers, but real estate around Kavarna and Balcik are increasingly in demand.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the interior will also attract investors sooner or later, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, as well as the superbly affordable area of Russians, more buyers are listed.
The capital Sofia also offers attractive offers - commercial and office areas offer the highest returns.
Bulgaria is the best way to become one of the most attractive European golfers' paradise, thus attracting tourists in the other two seasons in addition to the summer and winter seasons.
Foresight investors are therefore already buying in a big style, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who acquire real estate in Bulgaria are also striving for a change in their lifestyle.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested people from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers at the Black Sea and in the ski resorts.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle down buy either revitalized properties of 50 to 100,000 euros, or fallen houses of 5 to 15,000 euros, which they will then renovate themselves.
Good connectivity and accessibility as well as communication opportunities are widely written, but the proximity to a big city, shops and doctors are also crucial for the buyers.
The second category includes those looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed in December among the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans).
The third group is made up of businessmen who invest with the aim of medium- to long-term added value.
Real estate in the capital is becoming increasingly expensive due to the ever-growing demand.
Although real estate prices are lowest in Bulgaria within the EU, there has been an increase in prices of 21 per cent in the past five years.
The cost of real estate prices far exceeds the increase of wages.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
As Environment Minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue by ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are consulting on the Bali Roadmap, which sets emission reduction measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the end of the Kyoto Protocol.
At present, a heated debate is taking place between industrial and developing countries.
The US has already indicated that they do not want to negotiate specific figures, but they would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other major issue of the conference is whether the developed countries are ready to support developing countries financially and technologically in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement was also reached on aid to developing countries.
The adjustment fund under the Kyoto Protocol is to be managed by a 16-member Council, probably at the UN Global Environmental Facility (GEF), as can be seen in the "Piac és Profit".
Hungary’s 6 percent
Environment Minister Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain its pioneering role in global climate action and to achieve a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister said that the EU would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (as measured by 1990 values), regardless of whether the "Agreement after 2012" was successful. The Union would even be prepared to commit itself to a 30% reduction, provided that other major industrial states in the world, or developing countries, are also willing to comply with their obligations in terms of strength and accountability.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the aim of the countries which joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2 percent, whereas the EU had already committed itself to a reduction of 8% with its 15 Member States at that time.
The target for Hungary is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to 1985-87 - a requirement that the country will fully comply with, as can be seen in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The commitment is high on Bali - after all, the long-term international climate policy agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly not come into force until after 2012. In this case, the reduction projects set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a new international emission reduction system, whose significance was also highlighted by the IPCC, the International Nobel Peace Prize, the UN Scientific Committee on Climate Change in its recent report.
As a result, emissions reduction would be delayed, and the increase in earth's average temperature by more than 2°C would be inevitable, which, according to scientists, would result in extremely serious and irreparable consequences.
British Army throws on YouTube
Units of the British Army have published photographs of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan for the purpose of increasing popularity on the video portal.
First of all, the British Air Force (RAF) has discovered YouTube for itself: In Afghanistan, specialized units have been uploading videos on operations conducted against the Taliban since March 2006, reports the BBC.
The miniature cameras shot on helmets are controlled at the Air Force Base in Kandahar and then sent to London, where they are placed on the Internet.
Political message inevitable
Air Force soldiers have already contributed 139 such recordings, their "channel" was viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered under "defencehead quarters" in spring 2007 to publish videos on Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Foreign Ministry (Commonwealth Office) and the international peace forces stationed in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channels.
Use in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force has published the videos aimed at recruiting soldiers, and, as the Ministry of Defence says, the contributions also serve to inform the population of the actual objectives of foreign deployments.
Such kind of published propaganda was almost free of charge compared to conventional television advertising, according to defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, but these videos always carry a certain degree of political message in themselves, confirming the existence of the military measures decided by the government in their own way.
American Throwing With Game
But the army must also fight against amateur recordings, which, besides carefully processed censored recordings, also create the net - such as those showing the death of the soldiers: In the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the losses are spoken of at most, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
Of the war scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan, by the way, numerous filmed videos have already been loaded onto the platform, but this "Gatting" has only recently been discovered by the British.
The Americans, however, advertise in a slightly different way, namely with the free downloadable shooting game "America's Army", in which the player can slip into the soldier's skin as part of a more or less life-like simulation.
Christmas party with Tombola and Pogatsche in the ministries
Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth is by no means simplistic: instead of Christmas, she organises a work conference that will allow her employees to end the year 2007 with coffee and pogatsche.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, other enchanting Christmas atmosphere with Tombola or incitement to the officials' hearts.
Party, Christmas spirit, concerts and buffets - that's how power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already captured the offices.
The biggest Christmas celebration of a ministry is held this year in the defence resort, but the staff of the ministry are not expected to do so.
At the "Christmas Celebration of the Orphans" children are donated by fallen soldiers, at the "Mission Celebration" family members are hosted by soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The resort provides around 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other resorts, the National Agency for Development (NCE) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport beat the strands.
The 4.32 million Forint Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs will be held in the House of the Future, about 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
The focus of the celebrations is on Christmas, but there will also be live-acts and tombola-redemption.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) held its 4.7 million Forint-priced Christmas celebration on Wednesday at the House of the State Justice Council (OIT), with concerts and a feast.
The hall rent was 1 million forint and the rest was spent on more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, a section of the NFMO is also invited to another Christmas celebration organized by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
The building of the Lustspieltheater ("Vígszínház") was rented for the celebration.
The MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information because we have not reached the authorities.
What's the suit for?
The OIT building was not only open to the guests of the NFO, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas celebration on December 7.
They did not have to pay rent to the OIT for the use of the premises.
About 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a speech from the minister, after the dinner there was live music to dance.
Upon request from [origo] one told: There was no obligation to wear ball or suit at the ball.
The Ministries for Health, Work, and Self-Government are preparing for Puritan Celebration.
The Ministry of Health organizes the celebration for the employees in its own four walls for about 400,000 Forint.
Minister of Labour Mondika Lamperth officially invites her staff not at all to a Christmas celebration, but to the annual conference.
One calculates with about 180 guests, who - so the press department - are only hosted with coffee and pogates, so the celebration with 350,000 forint starts.
The self-government minister Gordon Bajnai will be starting with his colleagues just in the department's aula.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organizes a Christmas celebration in its own festival hall to which 436 staff are expected.
The expenses were measured with 2,500 forint per head - around this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent incitement.
Since the beginning of János Veres' term, the employees of the PM have been celebrating in this way every year.
However, there will not be a proper party-stimulation - not only because of the Minister's official speech but also because the celebration was arranged for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites you to a New Year's reception on 20 January, the Ministry's Christmas celebration is due this time.
The one hundred guests are asked to go to Vajdahunyad Castle in the city park ("Városliget"); according to the information of the resort, the expenses are measured with 1,000 forint per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple reception, to which foreign diplomats accredited only in Hungary will be invited.
The receptions, which are held each year, traditionally start with a short speech from the minister and sound with restraining mutilation.
As the respective press offices report on [origo] request, there will be no Christmas celebration at either the Foreign Office or the Ministry of Education.
Asked about the costs of the Christmas celebration, no information could be given at the press department of the Ministry of the Environment.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration at the Kunstgewerbemuseum.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
The Liga trade unions and the Hungarian trade union federation form their coordinating committee on Friday for the strike that begins on Monday, which will last indefinitely.
On Saturday, a large protest assembly is held, on Monday - on the day of the referendum on the Health Insurance Act - work is stopped.
It is expected to suffer from strike-related, significant traffic barriers, as rail transport is almost completely stopped, and the Budapest public transport companies (BKV) strike until 1 p.m.
Details of the strike on Monday are announced jointly by the league unions and the union federation on Friday afternoon.
A LIGA - MOSZ strike committee is also established, which is responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
On Saturday, a large protest assembly will be held, and on Monday, all organizations that have joined the strike will lay down their work for an indefinite time, unless agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike started on the day of Parliament's vote on the Health Insurance Act was not defined.
If the National Council does not accept the Health Insurance Act, the unions immediately withdraw the call to strike.
However, if the law is passed, the strike committees meet to discuss the further action.
On the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even possible that it will be voting on the Health Insurance Act only in the later evening hours, or even at midnight.
The strike that starts on Monday will have to be expected with significant road congestion: the railways will lay down their work for an indefinite period, the majority of public transport and more than half of the Volán companies will stand still in the morning.
At the same time, there will be a direction of motorway barriers in many parts of the world.
The call for strike has been followed by numerous trade unions and civil organisations - the list of participants is constantly updated on the league website.
Some organizations announced strikes at an indefinite time, others plan temporary job losses.
Until Thursday afternoon, there was no agreement on sufficient performance between the Hungarian railway MÁV and the Free Trade Union of the Railways VDSZSZ, although more and more people are on the way by train right around the Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, the BKV will work from start-up to 1 p.m., at Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 p.m., the LIGA trade unions for electricity and heat energy lay down the work for four hours, and the teachers' union, for example, the Democratic Teachers' Union, has called for two or two or eight hours strikes.
The Hungarian Association of Doctors strikes nationwide at different times, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers, a sub-organization of the SZEF, the Forum for Trade Union Cooperation, holds a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points demanded by the league is that the government withdraws the draft reform of health insurance and submits a new concept for social discourse.
The second claim concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due from next year.
Question No 3 states that access to the early retirement system will be allowed to the eligible professional groups before 2010.
The fourth point is that VDSZZ, a member of the league trade unions, has not accepted the sub-lines related to the offer submitted by the Ministry of Transport and is now calling for a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increases State risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysis Division) of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded this August with the support of the "Move for a Better Hungary", have raised the risk of Hungary and the region in several respects.
Among other things, the Institute's "Risk Warning Report" states that in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is the "enhancement of existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy population in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic conflicts in the short term".
The main reason for this was the Hungarian Guard Strategy, which is probably aimed at provocation of such a conflict, according to the Research Institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure on the part of the political leaders: "People of public life have left the debate on the Roma question to representatives of radical political groups, who have now built their political strategy on the Roma Hungary opposite".
It is believed that this would exacerbate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, promote extremities, and increase the likelihood of violent conflicts.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard had been significantly damaged, not least thanks to the enormous attention of local and foreign media "the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember that since autumn 2006 the reorganisation of radical and extreme right groups in Hungary has been constantly under way, so that since summer 2007 several "national self-defense association" have been established.
"These groups tend to define themselves as civil organizations, while openly boasting of preparing their members - sometimes armed - for defence tasks (disaster protection, national defence, order-keeping), calling for the inadequacy of the police, the army, or the state itself," it said.
And further: all of this, in accordance with that method, which tries to defy various political and party degeneracy-based political aspirations as a bourgeois initiative.
The emphasis of the civil character and the form of the association are not merely the circumvention of legal hurdles that may arise in the course of the registration at court - it is at the same time a political strategy.
As the analysis can be seen, the activities of the Hungarian Guard represent a risk-raising factor for relations with neighbouring countries.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring countries, as some ultra-nationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries see the confirmation of their own anti-Hungary policy in the development of the Hungarian Guard.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region" - said it.
From the point of view of the Research Institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the whole region has increased.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose establishment was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the birth of the Bulgarian Guard, the Roma mass excavating took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU has taken the incidents immediately to the occasion of the establishment of the National Guard, arguing that the aim of the organisation is "national protection".
In your opinion, over the past 17 years, there has been a real "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, but the state has remained silent and indifferent - according to the Political Capital.
Furthermore, the initiative would have started a heated debate in the Bulgarian public.
As I said, the increased risk of ethnic conflict is also demonstrated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced to establish their own guard for resistance purposes.
As the activities of the Hungarian Guard have so far shown many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that the Hungarian Roma also react to the threats with the organisation of their own protection, says the Risk Warning Report of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, Research Director at Political Capital, said on request from the News Office: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the Research Institute.
Risk analysis reports would be published annually and risk-changing trends should be evident, public opinion will be informed as in the case of the issue of the risk warning report.
Holidays are not everywhere holidays
Holidays in Hungary are regulated precisely by law, so that the practice of redeploying the working days around the holidays has now established itself, but the coming year gives us fewer days.
In the EU and in America, too, we see something different as a "day of celebration".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between public holidays and days free of work.
Unemployed days are usually ecclesial holidays, or are associated with significant historical events.
For example, we also celebrate New Year: both the last day of the old, as well as the first day of the new year, are day-free - the latter alone so that the New Year celebrations can rest.
Throughout the year we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The public holidays are the 15th of March, which is reminiscent of the revolution of 1848, and the 23rd of October, the Memorial Day of the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20th, the founding of the state, on May 1st, celebrates the work, we remember our dead on November 1st and 2nd.
There are also two holidays on Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of the "working day shift" has proven itself in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price of the extended weekends, however, is that we have to work very well on the Saturdays before that, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is finally to be worked out, the Minister of Labour has been set out in his own regulation for many years.
The legislation applies equally to all employers, public employees and civil servants.
Except for companies and facilities in which the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. also on the holidays.
This year the working order is only slightly confused by the holidays at the end of the year: from 24 December, life in this country will remain formal, as most will take time compensation for the days between Christmas and New Year, or the special vacation for it.
In the next year, there will be more holidays in the middle of the week, or at the end of the week, so that there will be fewer redundancies in working days than this year.
The calendar is first set up around the day of work, so that people can stay at home for four days at a time.
Saturday, April 26th will be a working day so that Friday, May 2nd can be a day of rest.
The second redeployment will be linked to the holiday on 23 October: on Saturday, 18 October, you will have to finish Friday, 24 October in advance.
At the end of the year, however, will remain silent in the sign of the holidays, after everything will lie and stand after December 24th, even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six daunting little things to annoy colleagues at work
Emails that we forget to send, language messages that we never receive - harmless lies that no longer occur to us: they bring "colour" to everyday life at work.
The only question is whether one is accustomed to these small inconveniences or is better placed to challenge one and tries to avoid these misunderstandings consciously for other annoying situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone called from the marketing department" - says a colleague.
That you missed a meeting?
At best one regrets it and tries to make it up again by perhaps calling at the marketing department and confessing remorsefully, one would have forgotten to deliver the message (this is the less common method).
Most of the time, it's done with an apology.
Before you get caught up in embarrassing excuses, you should think about what can really be an unpleasant moment for your colleagues and try to avoid these situations consciously.
Borrow something that doesn't belong to yourself?
There's hardly anything more nervous than if you grab a document, office equipment, or the phone, but it's not there.
Yesterday the stapler was still on the desk - is it gone this morning?
Or is the lost ballpoint pen discovered, for example, on a colleague's desk?
Without questions, you should not borrow anything from colleagues, because they are rightly annoyed when they find that something has gone away.
So don't put any envelopes or post-it out of the office, because it could hit one of your own: none more if you really need it.
Gettratsche on the private lives of colleagues?
There is no effective means of stopping a trait that has already been placed in the world.
Who did it to who?
Where and why?
If possible, the information (or assumptions) about the private life of colleagues should not be attached to everyone's nose!
And if someone opens up and reveals his inner secret to us, we should not abuse that confidence!
The best thing to do is to keep silent as a grave, instead of telling those who are not present, even if others also know about the problems of the colleague.
Is there any reason to report sick?
If you call at the office to report yourself ill with anguishing headache, because you just feel unwell, or just want to rest, you should be aware of one thing: your own work, inescapable executions, fixed-term projects must now be done by colleagues instead of yourself.
So don't play bad with your colleagues!
If you already know the day before that you will not be able to do it in the office the next day, or that something could come in between, why you have to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither the colleagues nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with absence.
sum, geeks, phone calls
One is in the depths of his work, but is suddenly disturbed by the loud gibberish of the ladies?
Would you have heard a phone call that you shouldn't have heard?
Colleagues should not be bothered with summaries, singing, loud conversations (leading across their heads), getramps, constant shivering or nebula.
All of this can be very disturbing, even if they are not in the depths of a task (write, plan, organize).
Are the others always to blame?
If a project is not completed in due time, one has forgotten to send an important letter or important messages, one should not seek the guilt of one's own forgetfulness to others!
If possible, you should not talk about the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
The best one admits his mistakes and apologizes if others were affected!
The question of how to make up the mistake again, or to make up for the failure, is all too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like home?
Training pants and sleeping: Comfort for at home, but has lost nothing in the office!
Not even then should you dress so casually if it would actually allow the workplace to do so!
Just don't get too sloppy - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself so much that you dress in the office accordingly - if you wish, also beautiful and elegant!
To make it right for everyone - or how to become uninteresting for others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning.
A strange melody sounds from the radio: The sound of a violin, paired with electronic effects.
I'm turning the volume higher.
The pace changes, to the previous sounds comes the bass, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It is the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar, which sounds on mr2.
The local music scene has not spoiled us for a long time with qualitative electropop.
But now you even see the stature differently when you hear the new album by Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, as many new and exciting productions from the domestic digital underground scene are slowly contributing to a change in the overall picture, and even if the Garagenrock is "in" with its guitar set again, the home electropop proves: there is new under the sun.
Baláz's Zságer started in Pécs, music himself in the band Yonderboi before he – perhaps because a host house does not have two pipes – began to walk his own way.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which melts elements from jazz, electronic, and pop, however, was only when he was approached with the request to compose the soundtrack for a film (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Török).
The formation, which initially occurred in smaller clubs, became known to the wider audience only when the magazine "wan2" rated its first album from 2002 among the top 50 local albums and Zagar, along with Yonderboi, to the almost only marketable trend-setter in the West.
Undoubtedly, Zagar and his band were "trendy", but none of them were interested in wearing this brand.
The band reacted as it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album now released with the title "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open new paths to them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The term comes from the time Baláz's Zságer was still on the move with another band.
The airy, flying approach would also be fine, but besides the ethereal character of the music, the louder guitar - corresponding to the Zeitgeist and the trends - occur, the influences of the Rock'n'Roll.
With these songs, the singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", presented himself at the Millenáris premiere.
A song from the album has even made it to the radio-beater - Mr. Petőfi, who has been sending pop music from early to late, has repeatedly recorded the listener with the song "Wings of Love", which was recorded with the participation of six local singers ("Underground Divas").
So everything's okay (?).
The hvg.hu asked Baláz's Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Balázs Zságer: The term "layer music" doesn't mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be soft and meaningless, but they can also be produced only for the sale that makes them commercial music.
A good pop number can also arise from an honest motive.
The listener's readiness to listen also works in accordance with this principle, independent of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience of your music?
B. Zs.: In other countries, especially in the west of us, pop music has a larger tradition.
There not only teenagers or Twens go to concerts, but also the older audience.
They are much more attentive to the trends in pop music that are happening around them, because they also consider them to be part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Is it important who, where, how many hear your music?
B. Zs.: Of course it is a good feeling to see that more and more come to our concerts.
But we have never composed for the market.
With us the music is not created to serve a purpose, but for a certain reason.
The role of the audience is usually noticeable at the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but in turn there is only in the unmistakable changes of the moment.
Nevertheless, one thing has occurred to me: If you want to make everyone right, you are no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far would you like to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on his way as a soloist and has built his career in the West.
B. Zs.: We don't really go his way, except that you try to interpret this into our music again and again.
We see ourselves as a team player who trusts in the musical presence of the other and lets them unfold.
In the beginning, of course, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, as several of us came out of his band and took another way.
hvg.hu: In the charts of Mr.2 Petőfi "Wings of Love" is the first priority.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening deliberately staged with a slightly more popular style towards a wider audience?
B. Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit that was supposed to hold as a draft horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was thought to be the finale of the album with which we wanted to solve the soundorgy and the slightly more difficult themes.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six female singers?
Why just her, what was the guiding principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea of putting together the choir from talented soloists of the domestic music scene.
Thus the six-member choir was created - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then baptized as "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Did you want the song to be the same, or did the girls have it?
B. Zs.: The number has been in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material for the album was finished, we thought that this number still needs "something".
The chord sequence has formally demanded a singing voice.
I sang the melody that same night, and later they learned the girls.
Everything came practically on top and terrifyingly spontaneous.
I remember I was pretty electrified at the time, but it needed the "Divas" as well.
With my voice alone, the song would never have been so powerful.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert, however, one had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo party (except for the short solo of Judy Jay), they have no own role, sing completely together and are not louder than the music, so their singing is not only accompanied by music.
They also stood on stage behind them.
Is it intentional?
B.Z.: The fact that they stood behind was because of purely technical problems.
However, we deliberately did not want to let them get solo roles.
In the number it's also about forgetting one's ego a little, forgetting who came from where and where we're going, let's just let these particular wings that raise the wings of love.
I would like others to feel this euphoric state that we have felt when the song was created.
hvg.hu: Which was the most elaborate song?
B. Zs.: In the musical work none at all, there has been more difficult tasks when mixing.
For example, at "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", where I play on a concert piano, or at "Rock'n'Roll Goes to The Girls", where the Groove no longer wanted to work, but gradually everything came together like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite number of the new album?
B. Zs.: It changes continuously with the concerts and even now that I have "released" the album.
At present it is "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
Irrespective broker risked billions due to feelings of inferiority
Groundless fraudsters
For example, his former employee Jerome Kerviel refers to the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komerční banka.
It was almost five billion euros because of it.
It seems, however, that Kervail was only a big player who wanted to do the same to his colleagues, beyond that, certainly was not incapacitated.
Unlike all major banking houses, he recognized the crisis on the American mortgage market in time.
"He is mentally rather weak," was heard from the mouth of his superiors who showed him to the police.
But as Kervail's statements, which the French media published, for example, the daily Le Monde, show, he was a person who had earned 1.6 billion euros at the end of last year with his business.
Crisis Not Only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he says in his statement.
In the summer, he was able to earn half a billion euros just at the American crisis.
In fact, he had already seen the opportunity to do so at the beginning of the year.
In February there was already the first news that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as low-income customers or those who had past payment problems, would be put in trouble.
However, this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kervail did not believe this and kept it right.
At the end of the year, he had cut his profits up to 1.6 billion euros.
"Just as I had earned the first half billion, I didn't know how to explain it," Kervail admits, saying that he definitely didn't keep anything for himself.
During the whole interrogation, he admits that he has faked documents so that they don't get to him.
He even managed to lead his bosses behind the light, even though the Eurex stock exchange was gradually interested in his business.
Risk profit
Was he afraid to fly up?
Hardly.
"I thought she was satisfied with the simple fact that I earned 1.6 billion dollars for the bank."
Where did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to work out his position gradually.
He entered the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years he was already an assistant to a broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of 90,000 dollars.
Nevertheless, he knew that he would never earn as much as others would.
"Already during my first conversation in 2005 I knew that I was being watched.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development," Kermael explained to the investigators.
But soon after his entry, the first great success came.
With the shares of Allianz he earned a lot by putting half a billion euros on the price losses of this title in the London bombings.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you win, we'll let you
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But the bosses allegedly knew about everything, or else they knew.
"As long as I made money, you closed your eyes."
But then the big blow came at the beginning of this year.
One day he lost a billion euros.
On a weekend mid-January, he wanted to balance it.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer a bank employee.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros.
And how did they come to him?
Suspiciously he made himself through a vacation.
"I only took four days from the previous year.
A broker who doesn't take a vacation is one who doesn't want to be looked into the cards," Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has the chance to come to 365 billion
Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes yesterday, which will bring the Czech Republic 14 billion euros (about 365 billion crowns) in the coming years.
It is about half the amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Some 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive around 100 billion crowns from the "Company and Innovation" programme.
Most money, about 150 billion, will flow into traffic expansion.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and comprises up to 22 percent of the funds available to the Czech Republic from the Fund.
This money increases according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have over 90.8 billion next year.
The "Company and Innovation" programme is designed to help entrepreneurs and companies win funds for innovative businesses.
Companies will thus win finance for the introduction of new technologies, for business research, but also for the introduction of more effective organisational methods.
In the current EU fund money acquisition, the Czech Republic is among the new accession countries the least successful so far.
Nicaraguan court confirms twenty-year imprisonment for ex-Presidents
On Thursday, an appeal court in Nicaragua confirmed the twenty-year sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, to which he had been sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud of 100 million dollars (almost 1.8 billion crowns).
Later he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his Hazienda at the Nicaraguan metropolis.
According to the news agency AP, whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) gets back behind this Central American state is currently unclear.
According to the Chairman of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the detainees whether to let Alemán do his punishment at home or whether to go to prison.
A court observed four years ago that Alemán had regularly shifted government money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to their relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money ended up in a fund that Alemán had set up to fund his election campaign in 2001.
Budget is by
Yeah, it's done.
The state budget is approved.
What is special about this household?
It is the first budget designed by this government and adopted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
The year in progress was approved with the support of the ČSSD (Social Democrats) because Minister Sobotka (of this party) had presented him, and the ČSSD could not therefore refuse him.
Unlike the lively debate before the vote on the motion of censure against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Representatives approved this traditionally unreserved, yet very important law in all its peace.
This is paradoxical to some extent.
All government starts and ends with the individual chapters and items of the household, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an integral part of the policy, but is obscured by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more grateful topic for the media, and that is why they pay more attention to it.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting to the public than sober figures.
The government budgets suffered from three weaknesses in the past social democratic governments, which the budget cannot eliminate at once for the year 2008:
The first is the high share of expenditure which is compulsory by law, not only in terms of pensions but also in terms of social expenditure, which has decided the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (Communists) last year before the elections.
The second is the deficitary budgetary policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third limitation is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of municipalities.
However, the greatest risk is not the government budget deficit.
This budget is publicly and partly under control.
A true time bomb, however, is the budget deficit of the congregations.
Many mayors, in addition to tax revenues, levies and bank loans, issued additional sources of investment, often unconsidered debt securities that they owed their town halls to a large extent.
In recent years, they have been able to pay off these debts through the mass sale of shares in the energy and other supply networks which they had received from the State as a result of privatization.
Now this source is already sealed.
As far as we only adhere to official and verifiable facts, we note that:
our economy for a number of years, like the rest of the world, has been undergoing a phase of growth whose ČSSD boasts without letup.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, however, these governments owed even more to the State.
Other countries, apart from some exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more rationally than our Republic.
This is a huge disgrace mainly due to the former governments.
We are among the countries which, on a global scale, are at least at risk of poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes, which, unfortunately, have been blown up to a huge extent in recent years.
Even if it has been possible to delete part of the stupid populist expenditures adopted this year before the elections, it is clear that if there is not a shift of the retirement age and pension reform in the near future, practically any policy in this country will end and, no matter who is in power, nothing will remain for him as a mere administrator.
It is only slightly exaggerated when it is said that there will then be officials from ruling politicians who will mechanically divide the majority of tax revenue into pensions and social expenditure.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but can only stop the displacement of normal expenditure by compulsory expenditure.
The 2008 deficit of 70 billion crowns would be quite superfluous if previous governments had not spent what was going on in the last ten years.
If we do not want it to be a real matter for politicians to become purely administrative officials, then we need to be patient and this not too strong coalition government, which is aware that the state can only spend as much as it is able to take on taxes and fees, to want peace in the preparation of other reform laws.
Only these allow a gradual enforcement of a balanced government budget.

Banks Want to Cope With Crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial markets.
For example, more than 100 billion dollars will go to the foreign exchange markets through auctions.
In these auctions, banks auction interest rates to which they are willing to lend each other money.
For example, the American Fed sends $40 billion to auction, another 24 makes it easier for the European and Swiss central banks.
After the September 11 attacks, it is the first time that the central banks of the individual states agree on such a coordinated approach to defence or mitigate the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step is intended to eliminate the biggest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the growing lack of freely available capital that banks can lend," wrote Bernard Baumohl, a report for his customers, from the consulting company Economic Outlook Group.
"The coordinated action of the central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the US from 65% to about 50%," added Baumohl in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion for unused loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts are expecting further billions of losses.
"The central banks must have been really scared of what can still be done when they decided to do this," said ABN Amro's chief economist, Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
The central banks are afraid that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, loans for their customers will also be more expensive.
This would reduce consumption and reduce the American economy, possibly with effects on economic growth worldwide.
The central banks have decided after they had failed to lower the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank interest rate, which is used to lend money between banks.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid to borrow each other's money, and that although the central banks of the USA, Canada and the UK had reduced their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as another reduction in interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio from Tempus Consulting, Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this step will help the central banks to raise the crisis, because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the case of the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: Ecologist debates are unbelievable
Global climate change is said to harm developing countries most.
President Klaus again spoke about the problem of global warming.
The criticism now focused on the final UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A Blue, Not a Green Planet", he stated that the debates of ecologists were unbelievable.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which represents a strange mixture of government representatives and such non-governmental organisations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric they accompany and reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a firecracker that is only a substitute for a real solution to current problems," said Klaus.
In presenting his book, the Czech President stressed that his topic was very important to him and that he was therefore so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction at the fact that his book appears in German translation because "I often hit caricatures of my views."
Now, therefore, interested people could undistortedly look at his attitude.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climatetologist, but he felt he had sufficient conditions to write such a book.
Finally, he was a academic, capable of understanding and evaluating professional treatises, has experience with statistics and is also a economist.
As the main statement of the book, he stated that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are thus normal, that there is no consistent opinion among the scientists that the consequences of current changes are not too large and serious and therefore pose no threat, and that efforts to influence climate change are superfluous, inefficient and unacceptable.
Moreover, as someone who has experience with totalitarian systems, he considers it unacceptable to impose other unproved views, he sees this as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
On questions from those present, he repeatedly stated that he was not against "a reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who do not take into account the relationship between effort and yield."
Klaus had spoken about the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people failed to change their driver’s license
600,000 motorists failed to change their old driving licence, whose validity expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day you can apply for the exchange so that the authorities can issue a new driving licence by the end of the year.
The Ministry, however, does not fear that after the New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers will travel on the streets without valid driving rights.
According to the authorities, mainly those who do not want to drive anymore did not exchange their driving licence.
While small places report a strong decline in interest in ticket exchange, the offices of the capital are being overcast with requests, and interest in exchange grew this week.
The city administration manufactures about 2000 customers every day.
You have to stand for about half an hour.
In Prague about 140000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driving licence.
The exhibition of a new driving licence takes 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a reduced period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver must pay 500 crowns.
Car drivers who do not create the required exchange until the end of the year and start without a valid driver's license threaten to be fined from January onwards.
The perpetrator pays a maximum of 2000 crowns.
The police, however, can also make it use of a reminder in the case of wrongdoing.
In case of wrongdoing, the penalty may rise to 2500 crowns.
According to earlier information, the person of the church can also be punished by a penalty that does not run at all.
He could, it was said, threaten a penalty of even 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry has already called upon the offices to manage mildness and impose a maximum penalty of 1000 crowns.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one is threatened with a thousand crowns.
The driving licence is a document in which everyone can decide whether or not to own it.
It is not about a personal card that everyone, and one valid, must have.
People who don't want to drive anymore should give their driver's license.
It is sufficient to bring him to the competent municipal office or send him there by registered mail.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 are invalid.
However, motorists are gradually also required to exchange other types of driving licences.
People with driving licenses from the years 1994 to 2000 have another three years to change.
The validity of driving licences issued in 2001 to 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million more driving licences.
Court lowers penalties for detectives allied to Berdych
The former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are accused of having made a common cause with the gang of David Berdych, received 13 or 10 years imprisonment.
This was decided by the Prague Supreme Court, which reduced its sentence by one or two years in a judgment in force.
Originally, the detectives of the "Office for the Fight Against Organized Crime" threatened 14 or 12 years.
There is no appeal against today's judgment, only revision at the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also accused in this matter, but first he is faced with the original judgment.
In other trials, however, he had already received sentences of a total of 16 years.
He cannot be sentenced to more than that.
A district court in January blamed 19 people mainly for participation in robbery attacks, the Oberlandesgericht today negotiated the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the accused disputed the charge from the beginning with the reason that it was a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, members of the police in consultation with, among other things, Berdych criminals provided information from police sources, covered various robberies, and helped gang members to withdraw from the prosecution.
The band left Opava and Koňařík 30 percent of the spoils.
The charge is about crimes committed by the gangs from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, in the case of robbery, whose victims often suffered serious injuries, but also in the case of detention and illicit possession of weapons.
In house searches, the police discovered illegal guns, steel core ammunition, a laser target remote tube and a machine gun.
According to the charge, the gangs have enriched themselves by many millions of crowns because of their robbery.
In addition to nearly 20 men in this proceedings, the Courts of Berdych and a number of others recognized legal status as guilty for further robbery.
Other men from Berdych's perimeter have to answer in another trial, other cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The main negotiations have so far been to Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish custody and who are awaiting the final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic.
Children exchanged - bill: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a detention clinic, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, wants to demand 12 million kroner compensation from the hospital in Třebíč plus legal costs.
For each of the mothers three million each, for the fathers two million each, and for the children one million each.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, therefore does not agree with the proposal of Velebas at all.
"We reject such a proposal, it is too much," said Dostál after today's debate.
"But in order to be able to give us an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need the opinion that the other side had made.
We'll find out if it has any bearing on it.
But we are of the opinion that this should be in the hundreds of thousands of areas together," stressed Dostál.
According to him, the amount should move between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each of the four parents.
In the beginning, the family from Jabloňov wanted a million crowns for every month that she had not raised her biological daughter.
Veleba served as the basis for compensation proceedings, an opinion that had been prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
The parents of the children suffered mental damage and stress symptoms in different strengths and depths from specialists in the field of psychology and psychiatry.
The men were better off with the stress situation, even if they saw accusations against themselves that they could have prevented the confusion of the newborns.
In turn, the women are getting worse with the aftermath of the experienced trauma, as well as with what is happening right now, Veleba combined the content.
Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses at the reception clinic in Třebíč on 9 December last year.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Troyová to Jabloňov.
At the end of October, the district chief of Vysočina (Böhmisch-Mährische Höhe) handed over 100,000 crowns as a substitute for expenses created by the mistake of the hospital in Třebíč, which is under the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are compulsorily insured by law.
In the event of doubt, they must take up a reserve fund and only exceptionally can they apply for assistance from the institution.
The courts have so far awarded comparatively low claims, the amounts have been determined by tables and have moved in the range of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally of millions.
Polivka came to his kingdom Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute around the brand "Kingdom of Walachei".
According to the District Court judge in Ostrava, he was the first to use the name "Walachian King", but the project had built a team around Tomáš Harabiš in collaboration with the actor in many years.
Polivka did not take part in the negotiation today.
According to his lawyer, however, the matter is probably not over and his client will probably file an appeal.
"The dispute is about Mr. Harabiš and his team want to participate in the popularity of Bolek Polívka's parasitic," said Polívka's lawyer after the trial.
All of them introduced themselves to these actors and comedians in the words "Walachian Kingdom".
The same opinion is also Harabiš.
"We have almost ten years of work behind us.
"Cashing money and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the occasion is dispute for money.
"After years, they noticed that the project was successful and that they could also have some of it.
They want to win parasitic at our work," he continued.
Lucrative business
According to the court, Polívka used the name "Walachian King" for the first time in one of his television programs.
In 1993 he was crowned by the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
However, this did not coincide with the intention of establishing a fictitious kingdom at that time.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing Welsh passports.
From an initially fun action, a business and entrepreneurial activity crystallized out, then joined the Harabiš Foundation of the company "Walachian Kingdom".
In 1997 Polívka agreed to use his name and signature in the passports and even offered her owners reductions when visiting his farm and his theater performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also said today that Harabiš only used the mere idea that Polívka made public in the "Manege" mission for his business intentions.
"The popularity of Polívkas has certainly helped the project of the Walloon Kingdom," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team who had dedicated themselves intensely to him.
The co-operation of the parties which are now disputing lasted until 2000, when Harabiš organized the official co-ronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, between Polívka and Harabiš began to break up the disputes that engulfed in the abduction "King Boleslavs I. elected to the Saint Nimmerleins Day".
The leading role then took on the suggestion of Harabiš's Jarmila Šuláková as queen mother.
In 2002 Polívka filed an action against Harabiš and his company which the court rejected today.
Clarity in the dispute could bring the battle prepared by Harabiš around the throne and half a princess.
A new king should come out of it.
Details and an appointment he didn't want to tell.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It was supposed to be like the king's move in the Walachian.
The king should be elected for a certain time.
Also Mr. Polívka can register quietly," added Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Wind the prejudices
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
His driving characteristics were not much worth, the quality of the gearshift, the steering and also the processing could be described as rather below average.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and he is much better.
The combination with the name SW is still a bit further, and I just keep reviewing my opinion.
When I tested the classic Hatchback of 207, I had to complain, for example, about the lack of head clearance on the back seats.
These complaints are no longer available, because the bodywork of the Kombi is designed so that not even two-meter men will suffer.
Quick Forward
I'm just going through the interior so I don't have to repeat myself too much.
It is a rather successful design, where I object only because of the busy middle tunnel.
There I would welcome a little more design, where the car makes such an elegant impression otherwise.
The seats are comfortable, and past are the times when we may complain about short seats or head restraints.
The page content has also improved considerably compared to 206.
With regard to space, you can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the bodywork here.
In the combi, the previously mentioned lack of headroom is also eliminated.
Suitcase in the trunk
The main thing about this car, however, is the cargo bay.
I must call it very well loadable and space-saving (also because of the folding rear window).
The hollow rooms are equipped with straps that represent an ideal compromise.
They do not interfere, can separate and hold even heavier objects.
But let's talk about the charge volume.
According to the table in the basic equipment, it is 428 litres, which is a rather average value compared to competition.
However, not compared to the best-selling vehicle in the Czech Republic, Škoda Fabia Combi.
When we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we note that the Peugeot remains clearly 52 litres.
This value is already critical for a trip abroad or when a stroller is invited.
But in order to highlight the positive, I still have to mention the very flat cargo space after folding the rear seats or the very low load edge.
120 hp in four rows
Our test vehicle was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with a cylinder capacity of 1.6 litres and a power of 88 kWp.
And to be honest, it should be a 1600-cubic engine that drives a family hatback.
He's quiet, has a low consumption and gets away well.
If I compare him with his counterpart at Škoda, who sometimes seems like his exhaust clogs with a flap, then I can only be excited by him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not exactly popular.
However, we must remember that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 petrol engine in the height of 329900 crowns is still on.
With our engine it costs from NOK 410900, which is already quite a lot.
The equipment Premium of the test vehicle proposes once again with 80000 crowns in addition to beech.
However, we had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic disc wiper release, electric window lifts behind and...
Thus, the car costs a total of 531900 crowns.
That's a lot, but once you count the additional equipment of a Fabia and you'll arrive at a very similar amount.
So only the decision remains, which brand you want to choose.
Integration of Slovak pupils into British schools is not successful
At British schools, the number of children from Eastern Europe is increasing, causing local fears about the further development of the local school system.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans has so far encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools even identify cases where conflicts between the immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools is well illustrated by the case of North Kent, where the conflicts between the local and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Arbitration, harassment and delinquency among students have transferred to relationships between parents.
The situation has developed so far that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The accused defended that the boy had insulted her with racist charges.
The police also had to intervene on a Slovak immigrant after an attack by two underage girls.
The girls had allegedly made racist remarks to the man and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy climbed a bus house and spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he took us apples and pears and then blew his seat," described a mother of Slovak students from The Times newspaper as another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even described the conflict with the immigrants from Eastern Europe as a survival struggle.
The cases cited testify that the mood between locals and immigrants at British schools is becoming increasingly tense.
In the UK, 70000 Slovaks have been reported coming here for job search.
Some 30,000 Slovak students then attend British schools.
Cuba - most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, this will come true if you only select the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palms and All Inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and captivating cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this to a large extent.
But only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spaniards, Cuba was its bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place ever seen by a human eye.
Havana once became a warehouse or transit warehouse of treasures that the Spaniards had robbed in America and then transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The Nacional Hotel was created at the end of the 20th century.
Construction left it one of the bosses of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the United States (especially during prohibition) was liked to be seen and supported on Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana high houses grew, over the wide boulevards drove cars, which were among the cult symbols of the fifties of the past century.
Ernest Hemingway bought himself an estate in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht lying.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars from the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
You can also leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana.
At the bar at the Hotel Nacional you mix cocktails for you as desired.
And the cult cars of the fifties travel around Havana until today, because the once imported Schigulis and Fiats have long fallen apart in the salty and wet air.
Mag Havana, especially its oldest part, has come down sharply, nowhere can you find in the vicinity as many wonderful colonial sights as here.
Other places are being cleared up, such as Trinidad.
In view of the urgent need for tourism, there was a green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have been created not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and also on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a Marotte that is unique in the world and especially attracts railway lovers.
The sugar cane from remote plantations brought steam and diesel-powered narrow gauge tracks to the sugar factories.
Your fleet has not been renewed for decades, and so you can see cleaning and fully functioning locomotives, whose peers are there for some time in the museum.
Excursions
The most important places do not leave out the majority of visitors to Cuba.
So you don't have to write about Varadero or Havana in detail.
Just keep mentioning that there is a museum in Hemingways, mentioned earlier, whose visit should not be missed by the one who likes this writer.
The Viñales valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on lime soil.
The Mogotas, limestone hills and rocks, rising steeply from the valley floor, gathered fertile soil in their hollows through which weathered rock areas of dense vegetation are covered.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet him when you visit one of Havana's cigar factories.
It may also seem interesting that the Chilean episode of the television series "Major Zeman" was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city was founded shortly after the Spaniards had colonized the island.
Glory and wealth brought her the trade with slaves and sugar.
The wealth was embodied in the beautiful beauty of the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is such a remote place that there was no road there in the fiftieth years of the last century that would have connected the area with the rest of the country.
This isolation contributed to its disregard.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was demolished, everyone was glad that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon time for Trinidad, then it is worth looking at interesting places in the area, such as Playa Ancón beach or the "Tal der Zuckerfabriken".
In the evening, you should go to the Casa de la Música, which is lively after the darkness, and where the music does not hover until the morning.
Baracoa
This small town in the east of Cuba is one of the most beautiful in the island.
This view is certainly influenced by the way to it.
Both streets that lead from Guantánamo there must overcome high and crooked mountains and run through a landscape that is hardly touched by human intervention.
This eastern outpost of Cuba took UNESCO into its world heritage directory thanks to its pristine nature.
There is the best chocolate made, in the church one shows the cross of Columbus (in reality it was about a hundred years after the journeys of Columbus), and from the hill, where the former castle, the current Hotel El Castillo, stands, are several Table Mountains, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra Maestra Mountains, the pig bay and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana Cabaret, the sanctuary of Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves confess themselves, about all that could be written many pages.
But, as you say, look better with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, claim Americans.
Not enough soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment affect the United States according to the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO should design a concrete plan for the next few years, following the words of Minister of Defence Robert Gates.
The mission in Afghanistan did not go according to their ideas, and the representatives of the countries that have stationed in the south of the country agreed on this in Scottish Edinburgh.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban, the eight participating states also discuss further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, by its Minister of Defense Robert Gates, called on NATO units to increase their activity, Britain sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and in strengthening development aid.
"In Afghanistan, forward development is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to enable the inhabitants to start their own economic and security development," says British defence minister Des Browne of the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents has reached the highest level for five years, according to the American army.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, in the southern province of Helmand by even sixty percent.
The NATO countries have deployed some 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have come to an absolute limit as regards the organization and equipment of the units.
In concrete terms, they demand additional helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the next time and how we can achieve them," said Gates.
Similarly today, the Secretary General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop, expressed himself.
"I am not pleased with what we have available in Afghanistan to countries and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we needed, and that's too little," said De Hoop of the Reuters Agency, concluding three-day discussions with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months, there has also been a dispute among the countries involved as to whether all the allies in Afghanistan are doing their best.
Germany, for example, was criticized for being passive.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fight demands for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country," said Gates.
The British boulevard newspaper "Sun" this week called the German soldiers lazy.
"Afghan non-starred: The Germans make games while our boys are fighting," wrote the "Sun" in an article complemented by photos of German soldiers playing the table tennis.
The German imagery went over to the counterattack and printed a picture of a British unit in a Rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
Government debt will accelerate to one trillion in 2009
A government debt of 84000 crowns is not payable in every Czech country.
The total debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
The government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion wives this year.
At the beginning of December, however, thanks to the better development of government budgetary policy, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion.
By the end of September, the Czech Republic's government debt increased to 842.7 billion crowns.
Thus, within the first nine months of this year, they increased by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they have dropped by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its information on public debt from the beginning of October.
In every Czech, a debt of 84000 crowns does not exist.
Over the entire past year, the state owed more than 111 billion crowns.
"Up to now, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we may not exceed the limit of one trillion crowns until 2009.
Next year the debt should be between 900 billion and one trillion crowns," said David Marek, analyst of Patria Finance, server iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Vladimir Pikora, analyst of the Next Finance: "To exceed a trillion, we could come in the course of 2009.
When exactly, depends on the next budget we don't know yet.
If the situation on the political stage is to be shown to change, and politicians should be willing to save more, this could take up to 2010.
But I'm not going out of such a change," he remarked.
Debt growth
The government debt comes from the debt of the government and comes mainly from the accumulation of government budget deficits.
The government debt is financed by taxes, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, by bonds issued by the European Investment Bank.
Domestic government debt has increased to 719.4 billion this year.
The government's foreign debt has now increased by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable government debt reached 803.3 billion at the end of September and since June has dropped by 13.7 billion.
The average maturity of government debt increased to 6.5 years.
"Total debt increased by 13 percent from the first to the third quarter over the year, which is really a lot in view of how well the economy is doing.
It is interesting that growth is mainly recorded in the debt securities, where growth is 20 percent.
It's bad that the debt is rising, but on the other hand this shows that you can do something before the pension reform comes," Pikora commented.
Better Than Expected
The funding strategy and the management of public debt for 2007 show that the government had planned to absorb 159.2 billion crowns for this year.
At the beginning of December, however, thanks to the better development of government budgetary policy, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns.
This amount is mainly due to the government budget deficit, which this year will obviously reach 76 billion crowns instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
Furthermore, the maximum planned funding for the consolidation agency is SEK 13.3 billion, a 10-billion reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of government bonds for 43 billion and the European Investment Bank's bond rates of EUR 1.8 billion.
For giving a name to a Teddy bear, today she was brought before a court in Khartoum.
After her lawyer was reported, the British teacher, who had been charged in Sudan for insulting Islam, was sentenced to 15 days by a court in Khartoum on Thursday evening and then sentenced to expulsion.
The Briton was accused of allowing six- to seven-year-old students to give the name of Mahomet to a Teddy bear, although any representation of the Islamic prophet is forbidden.
She should've deserved to be fattened.
After parents of students complained several times at the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old primary school teacher who worked at the Unity High School of Khartoum was arrested at home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code.
In fact, this matter takes its beginning in September when the teacher asks her six to seven years of schooling to choose a name for the class teddy.
The children suggest eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reports headmaster Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Muhammad as their favorite first name.
Of course, Muhammad is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all also a very common first name in Sudan.
Afterwards the children created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the caption My name is Mohammed .
The bear itself did not carry a sign with that name, but the problem is quite simple that the representation of the Islamic prophet is regarded as insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons who taught at the same school in Sudan explained that he knew them well, and she would never have done anything to draw close to a religious faith, I only regret that she has asked the children to vote for a name, his opinion is only an innocent mistake.
An opinion shared by many of the teachers, who describe it as very attentive to their pupils and as a person who never speaks of religion in class.
Remember, at the same time, the first name Mohammed is the second most common name given in Britain, for which 14 different spellings exist in English.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered to be a form of honor to the prophets (which is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Can you, for example, give him a toy?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday there was no agreement at the last negotiating session in Vienna on the future status of the province.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo ended a sixth and final discussion session in Baden, Austria on Wednesday morning, without being able to overcome their controversy about the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not reach an agreement on the status, said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace in the region is at stake, its American counterpart Frank Wilsner Belgrade and Pristina urged them to comply with their obligations to maintain peace and to continue the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
No violence is expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added and indicated that there are quite clear tensions.
End of mediation on 10 December
The members of the Troika, which brings together the European Union, the United States and Russia, will meet one last time on Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province inhabited by Albanian speakers to 90% could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submitted their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The talks of Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and final negotiating session since the Troika had received a new commission from the UN last August.
Americans and Europeans expect their commission to end on 10 December.
The Russians, who had already blocked the approval of Kosovo's independence at the Security Council, insist on continuing the negotiations beyond that final date.
Russia was and remains advocate of a negotiated solution, a unanimous solution, said Botsane-Khartchenko.
One-sided declaration of independence?
After eight years of Kosovo's administration under the auspices of the UN, the Western countries consider independence under the supervision of the EU to be the only solution for the future.
Pristina is ready to announce this unilaterally if the Security Council should not decide in their favour.
Belgrade insists on stronger autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached, the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the hotel in Baden, where these negotiations have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovar rebellion and future prime minister of the province, shared his regrets.
However , he added that the plan proposed by Belgrade was the autonomy of a past , leading to murders and deportations .
Domino Effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, felt that a compromise was always to be sought and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade believes that it is particularly a "domino effect" in a region that is still so weakened by the independence wars of the 1990s.
For Serbia this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision be made solely in the Security Council, where their Russian ally holds a veto right.
The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word
Only a decision from the ranks of the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia, said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
These negotiations took two years.
You need to end the way they started, at the Security Council.
The journalists replied to Fatmir Sejdiu that the Kosovo Parliament would have the last word on the status, adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking population would run out in agreement with the Western countries.
Bush draws an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the International Peace Conference, which met on Tuesday under his leadership in Annapolis, Maryland, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed to a joint declaration.
He further stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately in order to find a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised to do everything to help them conclude a peace agreement by the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians have to destroy the terrorist infrastructures and Israel has to stop its colonization work, Bush explained, reminding the two parties of their commitment to the Roadmap for peace that they had agreed to in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authorities, under Abbas, aim at a peace agreement that should resolve all open issues without exception and including the central issues.
This term covers the three serious problems that are mainly rooted in conflicts between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees who were expelled from their homeland in the context of the 1948 conflict in the present state of Israel.
According to the American president, Abbas took the floor and insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be conducted in a comprehensive and thorough manner and provide a solution for all points, including Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water and security.
As Olmert took the floor on his part, he undertook that the forthcoming ceasefire negotiations would be conducted directly and without interruption and that he would try to end them before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for implementing its vision of two states, a Palestinian and a neighbouring Israeli, by the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has made it clear that Bush has obtained an assurance in this sense from Bush before deciding to attend the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis represents a great success for Washington, has led a plan adopted by all Arab countries in the way that Israel offers peace, in exchange for its withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied during the war of 1967, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis is a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and at its central points of view, the Saudi-Arab Prince in his interview with the Arabic daily newspaper financed by Saudi money.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this kind of local news, official versions and rumors face each other.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first findings of the investigation of the National Disciplinary Authority of the Police (IGPN), a police car headed for Villiers-le-Bel on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., on Rue Louise-Michel.
He had no use but was on strips, and drove at 40-50 km/h, without blue light, explained a spokesperson of the police.
A green motorbike of the Kawasaki brand, without approval, thus not released for public transport (see below), came, controlled by two young people without helmet, at very high speed.
It rammed the left side of the police car after ignoring its progress from the right, a policeman continued to declare.
The alcohol checks carried out in vehicle passengers are very negative.
The condition of the car (encapsulated wing, split windshield, torn-off bumper rod) testifies to the rigidity of the impact.
Very quickly, as early as yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an investigation on the "facts of the involuntary murder of persons and the lack of assistance to persons at risk", in agreement with Val-d`Oise's main Public Security Board.
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the prosecutor said that she ruled out the investigation of the IGPN at this stage of responsibility for the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident that were heard on Sunday evening confirmed the version of the police, namely that this small-power wheel has arrived relatively quickly on their left side.
Yesterday, some kind of rivet, probably caused by the friction of the foot rests on the ground, showed that the two vehicles had remained intertwined until the police managed to brake.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical evaluation.
The dead bodies of the two victims were buried yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, a rumor quickly made the round, which said that the police had left the scene very quickly, and that, without helping the two young people.
Although the IGPN remains very careful, it would rule out any serious mistakes as well.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigations that are necessary for further investigations and in which one has to be very careful.
Libération has met an eyewitness of these moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had direct views of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her, this witness tells us.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely disturbed cop who limped.
Two others tried to revive one of the young people, the fourth telephoned .
In view of the rapid tension surrounding the incident and, as it seems, due to the certainty that the people present had about the unexpected situation of young people, the police officers were taken into the car by colleagues who had arrived at the scene of the accident.
According to this testimony, the rescue forces arrived about twenty minutes after the police left.
They have also used heart massages, but in vain.
I will not be allowed to claim that police forces did not help young people.
First aid has been given to these young people.
The fire brigade came right away.
Everything was done to try to save her, stressing the prosecutor.
In Pakistan, tension rises
On Monday, the Pakistani police struck down the first demonstrations, two days before General Musharraf had been called in.
According to testimony, in the city of Lahore in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who demonstrated against the measures taken in the context of the emergency were injured by the tears - gas grenades used by the officers there.
They then threw stones at the police.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily arrested.
There were similar scenarios in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers attacked and injured lawyers.
Several would have been detained temporarily.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court's attorneys called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests by oppositionals, human rights defenders and lawyers during the weekend.
On Monday morning the streets leading to the Supreme Court had been locked to prevent the assembly.
Other demonstrations had been held in Multan (Middle) and Peshawar (North East).
On Monday, the attorneys' movement received the support of the religious parties united in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president urged the people to flowers the judges who had spoken against the need to do so, and to send to those who took an oath before Musharraf.
Musharraf's promise is no longer valid
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly affected by the special measure announced Saturday evening.
In the following days, he had to take a position in a direct election on 6 October on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election.
The President of the Court of Justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed and replaced.
All that we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court, said the Magistrate of The News newspaper.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to give the upper command of the army and to become a civil president no longer applies since the call for emergency, stated on Monday the Deputy Minister for Information Tariq Azeem.
It was expected that he would submit his military uniform until November 15, the date on which his first term as President ends.
The Deputy Minister for Information has also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government denounced the persistent rumors in the country, according to which President Musharraf would have been assigned a residence by his deputy commander.
Still more than one third of pregnancy is not planned
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which allowed contraception in France, one of three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, as a study by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the various methods of contraception such as the pill or the spiral still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which notes that the percentage of drug users aged between 20 and 40 who use the pill has risen from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalisation of contraception has nevertheless enabled better control of fertility.
In any case, eight out of ten births are carefully planned these days.
For one out of five couples even calculated exactly on the month, and, if possible, in spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the occupation of the International Space Station (ISS) will have taken more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector that is indispensable for the continuation of scientific work at the station.
A daring exit that, due to its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools built by the astronauts to perform the repair, has achieved several records.
The problem arose on Wednesday, when the astronauts had downloaded the Harmoniy module from the space shuttle Discovery, a large cylinder-shaped part, which is about to take up the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module laboratories.
But you have to be able to supply them with power.
The second task of the crew was therefore to implement a 17,5 tonnes heavy module for power generation via solar collectors already on the ISS to bring it to its final position.
After it was moved, the crew began to restructure the solar panels of the module, with a voltage of 76 metres.
And it happened that one of the collectors that can fold up like accordions was damaged by a taped cable on a length of about 1 meter.
The restructuring was stopped in order not to damage the collector any more.
The astronauts, who originally left the space shuttle Discovery for a check-up and then had to repair another solar collector whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was selected to walk around at the end of the 30-metre long remote control arm of the space shuttle that had been installed at the station to perform the repair.
He is one of NASA's best space walkers.
Large, resilient, very clever, he has a well-developed upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old trained doctor was thus selected to operate the injured solar collector.
After carefully examining the damage, he cut through the faulty cable and fixed some sort of rail to the damaged spot.
He was supported by a second space walker who remained near the lock, and, from within, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commandant of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini hockey racket, wrapped with an insulator to prevent an electric impact on the solar collectors that produce several hundred volts, had the astronauts on board the station invented and stacked.
When the action was finished, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector had fully reopened before counting his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation, before today seven astronauts returned to the space shuttle Discovery to enter the Earth on Wednesday.
The title of EADS sanctioned on the stock exchange
After the Aviation and Defence Group announced that it will have to spend between EUR 1.2 and EUR 1.4 billion to counter the A400M residues, the EADS share is currently showing a significant decrease in the Paris Stock Exchange.
EADS is currently losing 4% to EUR 21.96 on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to review its business forecasts for 2007 again referring to the residues caused by the slow progress of the A400M engine, which delay the flight of young aircraft.
The costs announced in October to offset the delay in the delivery of their military transport aircraft range from EUR 1.2 to EUR 1.4 billion, of which more than one billion for Airbus, the parent companies of the European manufacturer EADS announced.
Due to this cost, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 in the presentation of its quarterly results for 2007, without adding any further detail.
The Group also states that the assessment of the new costs is related to the six-month lag.
As a reminder, the EADS business performance fell from 86% in 2006 due to the costs associated with the delay of another program, the very large carrier A380.
The group originally planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army for October 2009.
Choice of the Status Quo
On Sunday it will not be exciting in the count of the urns: The mass of the Russians will decide for President Putin's party, United Russia.
After a very closed election campaign, she confirms her quest for stability, even after authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a message to the voters broadcast to the public, who have already been recorded, but whose contents are kept secret.
He does this in his capacity as the United Russia's leading candidate, the Pro-Kreml Party, for which an overwhelming victory is announced.
Yesterday, the president did not let anything get through when he received the foreign ambassadors, and was satisfied with providing a new attack point against the Western powers who are accused of interference - his favorite theme during the election campaign.
We know the price of true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they have disappeared.
She's emboldening a campaign of blackmailed by oppression.
The Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov said there had never been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the suppression of the demonstrations on the last weekend, former chess world champion Garry Kasparovder had been sentenced to five days imprisonment for unauthorized demonstrations, according to his lawyer continued to be banned from visiting.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovietus
After these parliamentary elections, two very important questions arise:
Who will be Putin's successor as president?
The official newspaper announced yesterday the date of the first election of the presidential elections, 2 March 2008; the candidates have time to make themselves known until 23 December.
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin is unable to stand for a third consecutive mandate.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
President of the majority of Parliament and the All-Powerful United Russia, the government and President will be elected?
Whatever it will be, in the parliamentary elections or in the presidential elections, the previous power will triumph.
That's tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of the Homo Soviet, they are not the master of their destiny, says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center of Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg goes back even further: Civil society has developed very slowly in this country, which has been christianized five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
Following the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin once again linked to the model of a paternalist state, which was completely adopted by the population, the more so since this new paternalism did not follow terrorism, but a certain economic prosperity, Maria Lipman said by the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians forcibly renounce the personal responsibility that they have recently shown after the collapse of the USSR.
For what long?
This phenomenon affects all levels of society, including the business world.
And the administrative elite understands holding the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian regional presidents) are leading the United Russia's local electoral lists.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often as significant with chaos as in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: Consider for what a long time?
Those who are in power are not so bad as to replace them?
A heavy memory.
After being treated confidentially for more than 60 years, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are housed at a total length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, could not be considered until now, unless it was intended to be humanitarian, individual and called upon, i.e. at the request of a former victim or his family.
In May 2006, the 11 States, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, entrusted with their administration agreed to make them available to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this Decision has been completed, the opening of the market has been valid since yesterday.
Heikle information
Historians' access to Bad Arolsen will enable them to conduct research, especially on the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of the concentration camps and the state of health of forced labour, explains Reto Masters, head of this archive, which are managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were opposed to making these name-related documents available to the public due to the delicate nature of certain information.
Like, for example, the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some deportation victims.
The prisoners of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo had been collected after the war for a practical reason: civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labour, and possibly to provide them with evidence of their arrest in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen more than 300 permanent tens of thousands of personal questions are working.
However, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
It is not possible to expect anything fundamentally new in these documents, Pr. Wolfgang Benz, Head of the Research Center for Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin, declared 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008.
At present, mutual trade between India and Europe reaches EUR 60 billion this year.
The EU is India's most important trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, stated that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU's foreign ministers had given the European Commission a green light last April to open negotiations with India, South Korea and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), with the aim of signing free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the figures of the European Commission, India is only the ninth trading partner of the EU.
A free trade pact will bring forward the two economic areas enormously and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans, confirmed Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most frequently exported products from India, said the European Commissioner. Asian and European giants exchange goods worth EUR 47 billion and services worth EUR 10 billion each year, this week Daniéle Smadja, Chairman of the European Commission’s Delegation to New Delhi, had declared that mutual trade has not yet exhausted its potential. On Friday, the EU and India meet for their eighth diplomatic meeting in New Delhi, with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barrosso.

The Bank of England notes the alarm and offers 10 billion pounds for five weeks
On Thursday, the Bank of England expressed concern about limiting the recent recurring concern about the loan terms and announced an offer of ten billion pounds with a basic interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer of unusual duration.
In order to mitigate the fears that the financial market conditions will be particularly severe at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty about the way in which they are to organise their liquidity positions during this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its savings during the maintenance phase which begins on December 6th , in the form of an open market operation for five weeks , it shall provide a communication.
The Bank further states that in this way, on December 6th, at 12.15 GMT, 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put into circulation, at the basic tax rate and only until January 10th.
This seems to be the first time that the BoE has circulated in an open market operation liquidity for five weeks.
This usually happens for a week.
The BoE adds in its Communication that it is prepared to take further steps to obtain the interest rates on interbank loans with their basic interest rate from day to day.
On Wednesday, the interbank rate varied from day to day, at 5,829%.
The three-month interest rate has been down to 6.6%, slightly higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums put into circulation by the Bank of England were coupled with fines that had prevented banks from using them.
According to some rumors, reinforced by the development of the pound price in contrast to the euro, many suggested signing for the amounts circulated by the European Central Bank at more favourable interest rates and with more secure discretion
UMP and NC refuse to review PS proposals for purchasing power
On Thursday, the groups UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which is similar to a rejection of the text.
The text, drawn up in the framework of a socialist niche (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary group), indicated about ten measures adopted by the National Committee of the PS on Wednesday, of which a majority of them were 50% on the employment allowance, the reintroduction of the TIP, a transport check or the limitation of rents.
After the UMP and NC had voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes against 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main discussion, which partially led to violent exchange of words between majority and opposition, some hours before the television contribution by Nicolas Sarkozy on purchasing power.
The leader of PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group will present the whole of their proposals as an amendment to the legislative project for the correction of the finances that had been examined by the Assamblee last week.
A new festival is being born
As a result of numerous rumors regarding the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the Promoter/Producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of the British producer Melvin Benn.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who, no more and no less, served as a model for the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones told from C3 on Bilboard.com.
C3 hosts the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer camping holiday destination.
The festival will probably take place from August 8-10 on a 500 acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the world's most renowned festivals.
In 1989 he took over the leadership of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added his portfolio to the Leeds Festival, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn, in his capacity as co-owner, has also taken care of the production, licensing concessions and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, describes the Glastonbury as the most inspiring event in which he has ever attended, says that his company and that of Melvin Benn work alongside each other in parallel to offer the area a European-style festival event.
We have chosen Philadelphia as a market and are working diligently with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in the city centre of Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We held negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have remained in political debate about the current administration, continues Charlie Jones.
"Happyly we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population."
C3 Presents has revived the Lullapalooza Festival in 2005 in Grand Park Chicago, after it was profiled in 2002 in the world of the festival, together with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The two events were able to reach $9.8 million in 2007 and $11.8 million in gross tax credits in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban setting.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, but ours take place on the urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is to merge these two concepts in one way or another, while at the same time conveying the impression of a rural festival on the European and an urban in the American way."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, takes on the burden of this event with joy," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuse to disclose the terms of the agreement, but he confirms "that they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to host a festival that hopefully will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the recording capacity of the festival is "very large", corresponding to about 80,000 people at the Bonnaro Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations were sent to the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of audiences," says Charlie Jones.
His partners from C3, who received the Top Independent Promotion Prize of the last Bollboard Touring Award, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
Not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood films to Montreal if no less than the Terminator opposes.
These lock attempts are among the delegated tasks.
A political "heikles mandate" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, appeals to Runaway Productions.
Is it difficult to negotiate with the "Gouvernator"?
"You have to be careful, because it is the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those who are thought to be the best," he says.
The run at the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the priority of cinema there is at the moment.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all the festival on the west coast, although that of Sundance, that of Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about presenting the films from Quebec, evaluating them and making sure that the producers give interviews.
The dark age had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
He will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Festival.
Is the stock exchange leading to a one-year rally? Disunity among experts due to the US mortgage crisis
With almost five weeks until the end of the year on the stock exchange, investors are already breaking hands with regard to the coming end-year rally.
However, the experts are not able to draw up safe forecasts in this respect.
Banif believes that purely statistically, the month of December at the stock exchange normally involves positive market developments
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to draw up short-term forecasts and only on the basis of statistics.
Although other experts do not approve such a strong price increase in recent weeks of the year, they nevertheless note that the stock exchange price is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market participant. These investments are mainly due to the lack of secure equity funds in pension funds, which are strongly affected by the up-to-date trend.
As a result, these experts believe that the stock exchange will be more of a lateral trend influenced by market fluctuations, especially because we cannot yet estimate the extent to which the US bank's interest rate may fall, an uncertainty that is mainly due to the rise in the crude oil price and the risk of the increase in inflation.
Javier Barrio, president of the BPI sales department in Spain, agrees that it is a daring time to announce an upcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a 4 % value since its highest mark on November 8 of 15.945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could successfully complete the year with almost 16,000 points due to the restructuring of the Investment Funds and the traditional grant made every year of the pension fund.
Nevertheless, the expert points out that this year things could develop somewhat differently, especially due to the end-year rally that already took place in the second week of December, and then immediately after the bridge day of the Constitution.
According to the analyst, the price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, analyst at Bank Inversis, the previous assessments of the market situation are at a near technical level, which could lead to a deviation from the index values, whose magnitudes depend on the consequences of the US mortgage crisis.
The analyst trusts that these results are positive.
The analysts agree on the selection of the values to be used to advance the Ibex to new maximum levels.
Solana from Intermoney matters that this year the great values are in line.
Among value winners, the expert would count the two major banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the given time.
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha assures the Bank Inversis that the increases will be accompanied by the banking and industrial sectors.
If the Rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
In recent months, the ACS has been on a refurbishment course and we hope that other real estate companies like Ferrovial and FCC will take the same route, according to the expert.
As regards increased consumption during the Christmas day, in the last half of the year periodic consumption will determine market behaviour.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are only represented in a small number on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December only showed two declining courses.
When the technology bubble exploded at the end of 2003, this led the stock market out of its crisis and at the same time initiated the last real end-year rally.
This year, in which the Ibex 35 picked up by 28.17 percentage points, December showed a price increase of 6.68%.
The fact that 2008 will be the fifth win-win year in a row (the Ibex has risen by 8.36%) and an end-year rally will show.
Popular will have opened its 200 credit institutions from Mondays to Fridays 12 hours a day.
Popular has decided to modernise a large part of its branches.
A total of 200 of them are located in Spain's largest economic regions.
For the institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches mean a large milestone.
But also for the other Spanish institutions, since Popular as the first banking group is the jump dares to extend the opening hours of its branches on weekdays to 20.30h and to commence on Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h.
The Bank Group of BBVA, which also repeated the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet reached a definitive decision.
The Bank's current negotiations with the trade unions seem to reach an agreement that closes 75% of all branches on Saturdays and opens them on a weekday in the afternoon, though not for customers.
Whether other banks join the new initiative that adapts to business opening hours will depend on the experiences of Popular Bank.
And that is precisely the intention which Popular pursues with their project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches which, due to their location, are able to capture the purchasing customership of independent, small and medium-sized companies, but also those of large department stores.
The Bank intends to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as they are not new but changed opening hours.
For this purpose, the Bank will reorganise the premises of those branches already located in business zones, while at the same time aligning them with the individual customer profile of the different zones.
Thus, the expansion of opening hours is linked to a new room design of the branches, which is characterized by a more up-to-date, colourful design.
The relevant bank representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring did not require major investments, but involved increased staffing, since a branch did not need more than six but eight or nine employees.
The branches, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tried his concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And the experiences were positive, says Ángel Rivero.
The offices of the streets of Bravo Murillo, O ́Donell and Gran Vía have been selected for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently runs about 2500 branches.
And another 60 who operate under the name Mundocredit. These are specialized in immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax, the model of BBVA is not used, as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
We do not want to compete for our customers, Rivero explains.
With Telefonica they have agreed to sell mobile phones with the help of external bank staff.
The Spanish Private Sender Telecinco doubles its stock market value for the first time and thus overtakes its rival Antena 3.
We did it.
With this sentence, the Managing Director of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, announced his satisfaction at the closing of the stock exchange. He had increased his value by twice his rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, dampened his joy: That's exactly what hurts me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had lower losses, he found.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they were not too low.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its losses to 15.66% this year.
According to Bloomberg, the company's value now reaches EUR 4.488.88 million, with Mediaset controlling the principal share of capital (52%) and Vocento participating only at 13%.
The Rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has registered a total loss of 40.5% since January, so its market value amounts to 2.193.46 million to half.
The market value of other listed communications companies, on the other hand, increases from Sogecable to 3,571 million, Prisa (publisher of Cinco Días) to 2,518.53 million and Vocento to 1,779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that it is two similar companies , says Vasile.
Uncertainly, there is still the question of to what extent we can actually act on stock exchanges, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at customer level.
Telecinco announced a week ago his plan to increase this year's first television broadcast with more than 1000 million gross profits from advertising revenue. This assured Giuseppe Tringali, the managing director of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the advertising company of the group.
If the project were to be implemented, the sender would increase its advertising revenue by 3.6% compared to 965.4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the stock market (up to 734.4 million), while net income from the TV business only increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
The analysts at the high payout ratio, which the company could show up to this time, see the key factor in the better market performance of Telecinco: in 2006, Alejandro Echevarría's company led a 100% dividend distribution.
Vasile, however, assures that after the purchase of 33% of the shares of Endemol, with Mediaset as a parent company, the ratio could still vary, even if it is too early for official disclosure.
We are committed to the official compromise to pay at least 50% of the shares, even if we have so far indicated much more and more.
I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders this year, whose share values we have already been able to increase by purchasing 33% of Endemol shares.
According to the analysts, the market is currently showing some losses.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced his profit calculation for Telecinco by 4% for this year and by 7% for 2009.
This is due to the reduction in the expected rate of growth, which will decrease from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
It has also reduced the expected earnings of Antena 3 by 4.5% for 2008 and by 7.5% for 2009.

The Congress agrees with the MIFID's directive which entered into force on 1 November.
At the same time as the parliamentary drafting, which ended today with the Senate's congress decision on the applications for addition/modification of the project, the government published the provisions resulting from the new law with the intention of enabling the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of Congress and Senate members, who in their negotiations and votes had pursued the goal of establishing the best possible regime that ensures investor security and regulates the individual entrepreneurial activities in order to ensure a generally efficient market situation.
In addition to the modernisation of financial markets, the MEIFID, which re-established the Securities Services Regulations, is pursuing an improvement in investor protection, an increase in the control claim of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and a promotion of cooperation between the various control authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive allows both specialised firms and natural or legal persons to provide financial advice and also contributes to the creation of new financial services companies (ESIS), the advisory companies which are associated with the investment and intermediary companies of securities.
It also expands the number of systems for the execution of financial transactions, adding the multilateral systems of the securities business and the systems for the internationalisation of trading orders, which would eventually enter into competition with the current economic operators.
The law obliges investment companies to register the focus of their corporate profile, the confrontation and the forms of dealing with risks on the market and to register all projects carried out in order to facilitate their control task.
The Congress's Economic Commission saw further changes in the aftermath, with the decision that the titled debt securities must now be regarded as complex financial resources for the investor due to their high level of risk, as confirmed by the US mortgage and banking crisis.
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal limitation of the working areas of diplomats of economics was used; 30 years after 1977 the regulation was adopted which restricted the fields of work reserved for economists.
The Senate, on the other hand, identified new positions in the financial sector, such as those of the economic mediator working on foreign invoices, do not require authorisation from the CNMV and its services to commercialise products and to generate customers at the same time offer several investment companies.
The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (VPI) has risen by five tenths in November and is now 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess inflation within the European Union provides the average price trend in Spain in November.
Its publication is in line with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which, by publishing the data, aim to compare local and quality with US products.
The forecast for the indicator can be prepared in advance by using the same approach as for the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using various other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of the calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) suggested that the indicator identified in advance only serves as an indicative value and therefore did not have to correspond to the final result announced on 14 December.
The Consumer Price Index (VPI) will remain at a relatively high level
According to the Deputy Head of Government and the Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance Pedro Solbes , the increase in the VPI was a temporary development in November , while at the same time ensuring that the price index would remain at a relatively high level in the coming months .
However , Solbes noted in the halls of the Congress building that even if the current figure is not good , the inflation difference of Spain to the other members of the Monetary Union has remained more or less the same in recent years.
He also stated that there were fewer surprises in November than in the previous month, where the government did not expect such a high increase.
We expected a value of around 4% , the Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance announced in view of the forecast published today .
Virgin calculates with Northern Rock revenues of over 42 billion euros over the next three years
The value of Northern Rock has fallen by more than half after the Bank had called for emergency credit from the British Bank in the middle of September of last year, and it is now only 12,000 million pounds (this amounts to 16,800 million euros).
At that time, the assets of the Bank amounted to a record 25,000 million pounds, a sum that has fallen significantly within two and a half months due to the loss of confidence of customers and also despite the 100% guarantee of the government that the money is safe until the end of the crisis.
The company Virgin, which would continue after the takeover under the Virgin Money brand name, will have to pay about a quarter of the UK banks' income, which will be made up of the plants in the next three years, in order to acquire exactly those 18 billion pounds that are still needed to achieve their 30 billion target.
The Group of Multimillionaire Richard Branson, who is known for his outstanding advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to have £50,000 million (approx. €70 million) flowing annually in advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
This week, Northern Rock named the Virgin Group, where three more companies are involved, as his preferred bidder to lead it out of insolvency.
The mayor of Totana arrested for alleged suspicion of participation in urban corruption
This morning the Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the village of Totano (Partido Popular) belonging to the city of Murcia, due to the urgent suspicion of urban corruption that was uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo represented the office of Juan Morales, currently a member of Partido Popular and, at that time, chairman of the Totana Municipal Council, and could, after information from Cadena SER, be the original draftsman of the plot.
The officials continue to search the business records of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not exclude further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, Juan Morales charged the attorney, the main suspect, in the case of urban corruption discovered at the beginning of this week.
According to information from Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular , and hence privileged MP Juan Morales, was arrested on leaving his client's residence on the basis of important burdensome documents related to the plot.
To this end, other sources of information from the alleged order payments report Morales to a Galician construction company that provided for the conclusion of an urban contract in which the construction of a 200 hectares of land was decided.
Eight people are currently in custody.
Bono agrees to accept the PSOE's candidacy in Toledo and, case of election victory, Congress.
Former Minister of Defence José Bono has accepted the offer of the President-in-Office and Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, thus listing the PSOE candidates in the upcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of a socialist election, taking over the office of the Congress President.
So it was announced by José Blanco, Organizational Secretary of the PSOE, and by Bono at the press conference, after a meeting with Zapatero was held today at the headquarters of the party.
According to the head of government, the offer to the former minister is justified, as it is important in politics to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
In addition, in the event of a victory for the socialists in the forthcoming elections, the mancha politician would appear to be running for the party as chairman of the Congress.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as president of the Congress, who announced last November 15th that he would no longer take part in the next general elections, end his career in public policy and use himself instead in the university area for climate protection.
The former minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the government president had been continually pushing for his return to political activity.
He also pointed out that, as in the appointment of Vice-President of the Economy, the party did not want to prevent citizens from taking over the President's post in the event of an election, and called this an act of transparency .
If he should actually take over the office, he hopes to transform the chamber into a house of respect and not the insulting or the shrew to make it appear more and more similar to the citizens.
Unfortunately, from time to time you get the impression that the only place where you can't talk calmly and calmly in Madrid is Congress, so the president of the government in the Senate was interrupted once up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised current President Manuel Martín and his good work and indicated that he did not want to appear to have already taken over the office, otherwise his political counterparts would call it arrogance.
Climate propaganda
Since the climate debate highlights both the skeptics of climate change and those who have a social and political debate in this regard are subject to unmerciful criticism, the movement as a whole must show strong cohesion.
Especially when it is a leader of the movement who, as in the case of the government president Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change to be more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
This proposal, however, brings him to the point of notor rather the non-action of his government, which has contributed decisively to the fact that Spain is at the top of the EU countries that have met the minimum requirements of the Kyoto Protocol.
Who are the people responsible for failing to meet the requirements to which sectors this is due, and why has his government, which had proposed the treaty with the planet, not stopped this development.
In addition, it is now forced to present to the Spanish citizens the measures it intends to take against climate change without turning around.
Which companies will be affected by which behaviour of citizens will be changed, which individual and collective austerity measures need to be implemented and what the economic consequences will be.
More specifically, who must sacrifice himself and pay for the salvation of the planet.
However, there is and will be no such statements in the future.
Just because it's about sacrifice and paying.
For the measures that can be taken against climate change in real terms are unpopular.
They are costly, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the petrol cent proposed by the PSOE even seemed strategically dangerous to Zapatero that he was forced to withdraw the proposal.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, so with pure propaganda and empty sayings without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, minutes and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, the otherwise suitable politician for election campaigns must neither speak, nor accuse, nor demand, but instead carry out the demanding task of decorating the meetings and of inspiring others with his gentleness and kindness.
However, this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not imply that the bicycle will become the only means of transport in the future or we can only be refreshed with a compartment.
The mayor and the police chief of Totana due to supposed involvement in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil arrested the mayor of the town of Totana in Murcia, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo. In addition, the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor's office and a hotel contractor were detained because of the suspected suspicion of urban violations, today it was called out of investigative circles.
The City Council was arrested at its seat, from where it was brought to the municipal office and in its premises until now surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the city administration and at the municipal building management of Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are linked to the last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, where it turned out that more than 2 million hectares of unexplored building ground for urban construction projects under the direction of the Galician construction company Nuaria were to be redesigned. This was to be built on the property 4000 apartments after the local administration had given it illegal commissions during the last legislative period.
In addition, while two other persons were not directly arrested, they were subject to an investigation procedure initiated and carried out by the first court of Totona.
The first six prisoners were brought to the judge today.
According to investigation teams, Juan Morales is also determined against the former mayor of Totana and currently independent PP member Juan Morales.
In addition, his ex-wife, the owner of a property company registered in Totana, as well as his current friend who lives in Murcia, is under suspicion.
The chairman and owner of the Nuaria Group, Vigo-based lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the manager of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company is supposed to have operated as a sub-group of Nuaria and received the lubrication money.
The investigations are carried out by the municipal authority against urban crime, under the supervision of the Central Unit of Guardia Civil, whose representatives, in addition to the arrests, conducted eleven more searches, most of them in companies directly related to the arrests in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry breeder, who should have acted as a middleman.
The construction group Nuaria was commissioned to build the largest residential complex of the locality belonging to Murcia, which should include more than 5000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired over 2.2 million square kilometres of land in Totana, which it was necessary to rebuild. The aim was to implement a construction project which would raise the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group comprises other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates in Vigo the parking spaces of Coruña, Venezuela and the Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the direct marketing sector and Preconiza, specializing in the promotion, sale and installation of components.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the comment published yesterday in the most important Finnish newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat (Finland, by the way, is at the top of the PISA study), which refers to the comment published in the same newspaper on November 18th; incidentally, on that day whose issue contained the criticism of the book Blackburns.
The content of the subject philosophy has become the topic of public debate after the tragedy of the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the cruel murder is an abiturant who quoted the works of Platon and Nietzsche in his news.
In an interview with the daily newspaper Helsingin Sanomat, the Chair of the Education Council for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, invited the teachers to take a more critical position on Plato and suggested that Plato's teaching should be removed from the sub-level curriculum for philosophy in high school.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the Criminal Code:
A. The download of a song would be a violation of the law, which would be punishable by six months of imprisonment.
But once again, if you rob a music business of a value of 400 euros, this is only considered as a simple violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the business up to a value of 1000 euros, theft is classified as a criminal offence, yet the penalty is lower than for a download (Article 234 Criminal Code).
C. If you give a car and give it back 40 hours later, the penalty is still lower than for a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than in a music-data exchange.
Taking part in a rebellious dispute brings a prison sentence of three to 12 months duration (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while data exchange results in a withdrawal of freedom of six months up to two years.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. According to Article 184(2) of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment at work is considered to be less serious than downloading a DVD film from the Internet.
F. The trade in copyright-protected films, whose author's authorization has not taken place, is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, if my colleague should be right, then someone has cut his demands up pretty much.

My home doctor handed me one of his long, strange research articles entitled: Money leads to activation of certain brain areas, especially when the others get more of them.
So the feelings arising from the monthly salary payment are dependent on the salary of colleagues.
The study was prepared using a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the last issue of the Science Journal.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonner Brain Research Center Life&Brain, the activation was then the strongest when the participant gave correct answers and his fellow player failed.
The researchers could see that brain activities were always very moderate when both participants were correct with their response and thus the same salary was received; but if one of them received the double, there was also a stronger brain activity.
I am not quite sure whether it really requires so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
The Minister of State from the Balkans
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has been insolently following the crimes of the Balkan Wars. Her seat is in the prosecution of the criminal court of former Yugoslavia, based in La Haya.
Their mandate will expire at the end of the year, and Carla will leave her office with a crying and laughing eye, as the main leaders of the massacre of Srebrenica - with the eight thousand Bosnian Muslims killed - namely the ex-General Ratko Mladic and the former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic are still on the loose.
Their names are on the list of directors from Switzerland Marcel Schüpbach as a presentation for the title of his documentary film La Lyste de Carla (2006, not yet started in Spain); a film that, at the pace of a political thriller, follows the Swiss state attorney from Belgrade to New York in its project to detect the escaped criminals and put pressure on the respective governments to tighten up their networks.
Which insurance is best for me?
The car insurance covering a possible damage caused by the driver includes a high cost, which in turn depends on different factors, including age, gender, time of creation of the driving licence, family status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
To own a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the right car insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, you have to be clear about what we're dealing with here.
Auto insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurer.
This agreement is recorded in writing by means of an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the insured premium agreed and is obliged, in return for damages, to present the amount of the compensation in question.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance which consists of several factors, such as age, gender, the time of the creation of the driving licence, family status, the type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
Insurance undertakings set their prices according to the statistics so that higher contributions will also be paid in the event of a higher risk of accident.
For this reason, more than 25-year-olds as well as women need to make fewer contributions, as statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate due to their caution.
The same applies to married persons, since according to the statistical values and accordingly also according to the company's convictions, they tend to be less accidents than single persons.
The benefits attached to the vehicle affect the frequency of driving and thus also the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
In establishing the premium, insurance must take into account a number of points.
For this reason, the driver also needs to study the situation thoroughly in order to select exactly the car insurance that best meets his personal needs.
At this point, we are now listing the most important points that should be considered when choosing insurance in order not only to make a performance-oriented choice but also to make a price-oriented choice.
The 25-year-olds are faced with numerous obstacles in choosing cheap insurance, such as low driving practices and young driving licences.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance policy to take out full insurance, there are nevertheless cheaper alternatives.
The cautious drivers can select a full case with self-share, so that the benefits of full insurance are covered, but at a low price.
This type of contract requires the customer to pay part of the amount resulting from the damage himself.
The amount is determined prior to the conclusion of the contract and on the basis of the amount of the insurance premium , which is higher than the amount to be paid , explains Luis Noguera , the main representative of Spain at First Europe , an online insurance intermediary.
Another option is the extended insurance, which assures the customer against external accident damage, but not against the damage caused by the own car.
This type of insurance would also cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's a advice.
If you are under 25 years of age, it is up to you to reduce insurance costs; so your credit increases by trying to be careful about driving and avoiding accidents.
A credit card is a reduction in the base rate of the relevant insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment includes an increase in tariffs said.
The amount of credits and penalty payments depends on society and its income.
If the company has a successful year behind it, it may allow to increase the bonus payments, Noguera explains.
As soon as the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to conclude a contract. Reason for this is the fact that with increasing driving practice the accident rate decreases.
Thus, it is most appropriate to opt for full-time insurance with self-share.
Usually young people cannot benefit from their past experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving, the Spanish President of the European company explains and adds that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice after the fear of the beginner has been removed.
Nevertheless, it is more advisable for a married customer who does not have children to take out full insurance; of course only if the financial situation of the individual allows.
Along with the insurers, couples with children are deemed to be customers with the lowest accident rate, and consequently their contribution payments are also low.
In this case, full insurance with self-share (in the case of an amount of EUR 300) would be the best option. In the case of high credit, an extended insurance policy should be used only for the third vehicle year.
They are generally more relaxed and possess a greater purchasing power that allows them to make a higher contribution payment, Luis Noguera notes.
For pensioners, it offers to take out full insurance with self-share (with an amount of EUR 150) or an extended insurance, which only applies with a sufficiently high credit.
Finally, it must be noted that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver from possible accident damage, but also because it carries high costs that require a thorough choice that corresponds to our personal situation.
The Celtic Glasgow hopes for the eighth finale in Milan
The FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will be fighting in San Siro next Tuesday for the missing point in order to reach their respective goals before the completion of the Champions League preliminary round. The Italians need the point to reach the top of their group while deciding on their participation with the Scots.
The Italian team has already confirmed five points and has already confirmed its participation in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow still needs another one with nine points to make sure that the FC Shakhtar with six points does not catch up with Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two games of Group D will take place one week before the end of the sixth round, as FC Milan will have to take part in the FIFA Club World Championship in Japan, where he will fight for the first time in the semi-finals for the final, which will take place at the 16th.
Thus, this group will be closed before all others and the undecided in the Guiseppe Meazza Stadium to the expected overall result, even if both teams will try to win. The Italians will not speculate at home want to know the Celtic Glasgow that they would have a better starting position in the eighth final in the event of a victory.
The team of Gordon Strachan could even have enough defeat to qualify for the FC Shakhtar. However, he should not rely too much on such circumstances, because at nine points the Ukrainians are allowed to participate; they had lost in Glasgow last week (2-1), but were able to win in the second game (2-0).
Thus, the Milaners will try to avoid the Scots in the evening. They hope to achieve for the second time in a row the eighth final of the redesigned Champions League, after they were defeated in the previous season in exactly the same round by a gate of Kaka during the replay time (1-0) and by a zero to zero undecided on the spin.
While FC Shakhtar is waiting for Rossoneri's victory, the team will have to focus on its own game, as both reaching the eighth final and its membership of the UEFA depend on its victory and defeat of Celtic Glasgow.
In spite of its lower table position and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the largest European championship, Benfica Lisbon could win third place and thus play a part in the UEFA.
20,000 people visit Vancouver for the first concert of the Spiice Girls Tour.
In the Canadian Vancouver, the Spice Girls gave the eyes of 20,000 viewers the start for their first tour after the band was dissolved in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) y 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell), shortly before the start of their concert at GM Place de Vancouver, explained that the mood in the reunited band was excellent.
Around 20,000 people were able to experience the concert at the sold-out stadium, where a video on the history of the band, which had provided for terror at the end of the nineties, was shown.
The reunion and the world tour overlap with the release of a new album, which includes their biggest hits and two more new songs, headlines and Voodoo, and which appears in Spain under the EMI label.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore gold bracelets on stage, which had previously given them the husband of Posh Spice, English footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the fans in the audience who made the GM Palace rejoice, although his wife's nerves Victoria had forbidden him in the previous days.
During the preparations for the Show, Victoria Beckham told us that the British Star didn't get our wardrobe to face once, and that's why I'm very excited about what he's going to think about.
Sporty Spice , whose resignation from the group in 1998, due to internal disagreements two years later brought about the group’s dissolution, expressed her nervousness two hours before the concert at a press conference.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world public had changed, that the feelings of the Spice Girls had changed.
And that's why I thought, why not, so I'm glad to have made this decision, Chisholm commented on the separation of the band that she had caused nine years ago.
The singer was also told that the disputes were resolved and that they were all very happy to return.
Nevertheless, many things have changed since the last joint appearance of the Spice Girls in 1998.
First of all, the group arrived in a special engine of Virgin Airlines in Vancouver, reported by the TV station CTV.
Upon their arrival at the airport, the band was received by an army of nannys.
The five have seven children together.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will be in California, San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
In Madrid they will enter the stage on December 23rd.
New fears about natural gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk of Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe being affected.
The majority of Russian natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) is managed by Ukraine and any dispute between the two nations is very closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will charge higher transit fees from Russia.
Previous conflict between the two countries reduced deliveries to the EU countries last year.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow is happening at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state of gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine must pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine needs to be calculated more because the Group has agreed to pay up to 50% additional for natural gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine has to pay 40% more for Gazprom imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in discussions," said Ukraine's Minister of Economic Affairs Anatoli Kinakh of the Reuters news agency.
"The changing prices of natural gas should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the level of transit fees [to Western Europe] across Ukraine."
In the last major natural gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom cut deliveries to Ukraine.
This led to a case of exports to Western Europe, which dramatically increased prices.
Russian gas is one quarter of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the world's largest gas deposits, but much of them remain underdeveloped.
The consequence is that Gazprom complements its own supplies of gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service has to improve the controls of the pre-criminal records for workers from outside Europe, said a member of the control body outside.
The recommendation of the main financial controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor was brought in Scotland in connection with the attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish public health service did not have a precise idea of the number of his foreign staff.
But his report pointed out that other important controls were carried out correctly in a sample of five health authorities.
The main financial controller examined personnel recruited outside the European Economic Area following the attack on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a ground car was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video transmission at Old Bailey in October and was charged with the suspected car bomb attack in Britain.
It is expected that the public health service will carry out checks prior to the appointment of foreign staff to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorizations to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to verify criminal records, the Agency does not have the competence to obtain this information outside the UK.
The report of the Chief Examiner now states, in addition to other recommendations, that the Executive Board should take up guidelines on criminal records that help employers to control in different countries.
"Although we have found references to these controls in some staff documents, they have not been carried out routinely," the report noted.
Black said that the Scottish health authorities would follow their investigation guidelines with a high degree before the appointment, but added: "Our report shows areas where the system can be improved to ensure that precise information on the number of foreign health service staff is available."
BMA Schottland Chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations in advance of the appointment of potential NHS staff would identify people who could commit the future terrorist attacks.
"The report says that the NHS Scotland's current pre-recruitment tests are working well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will provide," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say that they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the vast majority of them doctors and nurses.
However, the Financial Controller warned that the number is probably higher, also because the Boards have problems identifying those employees who are on leave for an indefinite period of time.
The investigation continued to show that established control procedures were largely complied with by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian.
These include passport, work permit, and qualification checks.
the Scottish Government is currently reviewing its pre-employment policies and guidelines for foreign personnel in the NHS.
The Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said, "It was a matter for me to carry out this work in the face of the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
It added that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and would ensure that the best practices in updated guidelines on pre-employment controls would be reflected by all staff, including those from abroad, whose publication is planned next month.
Joy Division dominates Film Award Ceremony
Control, the film biography about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis has won five prizes at the British Independent Film Festival, among other things for the best film.
Prizes were also awarded to main actor Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before being cast for the role of Curtis, directed by Anton Corbijn, and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Dame Judi Dench was awarded the best actress for the Thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond actor Daniel Craig won the Variety Prize for putting the British film into the world public.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis ascent to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at 23 years.
The black and white film - on whose soundtrack The Killers, David Bowie and New Order can be found - was shot for only 3 million pounds.
Nevertheless, he has brought in two prizes to the Dutch photographer Corbijn, so far best known for the cool cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree - as the best director and best director.
Rock music was the focus of another award winner at the ceremony - as Julian Temple's film about the Clash singer Joe Strummer received the prize for the best documentary.
The prize for the best performer went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as driver of a Russian Mafia boss in David Cronenberg's London-playing Thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstonon, who is called to play hard guys, has picked up the Richard Harris Prize for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Biest, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winston said he was proud to receive the prize, named in honor of Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
"There were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He is my kind of man, a great actor of his time, I am truly honored."
The independent film awards, known as biphas, are selected by a group of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for a terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia discovered yesterday that it arrested 208 militants because of their belonging to cells that planned an imminent attack on an oil plant as well as on clergy and security forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter said that one of the cells was planning to smuggle rockets in.
Sympathizers of Al-Qaeda have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, as a result of the invasion into Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000 man strong fast Eingreifte team to protect plants after a failed Al Quaida attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to an in-ministerial declaration, says that 18 of the prisoners were part of a cell led by a "raket expert" who illegally immigrated to the country.
He reported that the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the Kingdom.
According to the report, 22 more of the prisoners tried to kill the clergy and security forces.
The government has been warned to do more to stop Saudis who are striving for Iraq to join forces with Al Qaida militias who want to fight the Allied armed forces and the US-backed Shiite Muslim government, which is considered heretic by the hardliners under the Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaida militias consider many clergymen in Saudi Arabia to be in cooperation with the authorities in support of the policies of the royal family that dominate the government.
The militias - accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Al Qaida leader born in Saudi Arabia to target the provincial Saudi government - have seen it in foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy plant.
"This was a very great effort by the security forces over the last... five months," a spokesman from the Ministry of the Interior told the state television.
The arrests also involved a "media cell" of 16 from Medina, which aimed to advertise for the "Takfiri thinking" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims, which supports violence against Muslims that are marketed as unbelievers and apostates.
Among the prisoners were also 32 people who were accused of providing the militia with financial support.
The climate on Venus could reveal a view of the future of the earth
The Venus may once have been a pleasant place to live, said scientists yesterday.
Data from an orbital European spaceship show that the planet resembles an averse twin of the Earth even more than was previously known.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to the earth.
The two worlds have about the same size and similar planetary orbits, but the Venus of the Sun is somewhat closer.
Billions of years ago, there would have been conditions on Venus that would have been very similar to those on earth and could have even been habitable, scientists believe today.
But because of the unbraked carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation and a slower rate of rotation, Venus took a completely different development course.
Today the planet is deprived of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the Venus Express space probe of the European Space Agency, which examined the plant for a year, provide a sobering view of how the earth could develop in the face of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University, one of the leaders of the Venus Express Mission, said: "It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar."
"Our new data enable us to construct a scenario in which Venus began billions of years ago as the Earth, possibly with an indwelling environment."
"Enriched uranium" confiscated by the police
One kilo of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was confiscated yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
One police officer said that three people were arrested and that the material was being examined.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said that it could have been sold for $1 million (480.000 pounds).
Everything is still open
With Romey said he did not consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate finally declared himself ready for the presidency to engage in a debate on YouTube, in which normal voters take questions on video and submit them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday evening, 28 November, were as ridiculous as the snowman, the democrats questioned about global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party.
But the questions, and the answers, reflected this time exactly the state of the Republican party that breaks up in the elections next year.
It is not known, just like the producers of CNN, who supported the debate with those who chose the upcoming candidates to show YouTube clips.
However, immigration was at the centre of the first half hour of the debate, which was the longest devoted to a single subject.
The topic is one of the most important issues for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of undecided voters to operate a ballot box when they heard things they liked: The TV station noticed tips of approval as the candidates spoke strictly about the borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Romney, who has pushed forward in the crucial polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tries to shake off the reputation that he had been thorough about illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in which he accused the former governor of Massachusetts of employing illegal immigrants at his house.
The two were particularly sceptical as questioners when asked whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (the illegals would give a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Insignificant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman from Colorado, succeeded in following up on this subject.
None of the two men have serious chances of nomination, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they have been before and harder than others on the immigration vacuum.
At least in the field of immigration, candidates generally share the same views: tighter borders, intolerance towards illegal migrants.
This theme, along with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps Republicans to forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly raised in a problematic way than other issues.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the questions asked whether the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to take the view that although the Bible is his preferred book, he may not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - in contrast to all expectations in the first place in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservativeism - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressed to see if Jesus would support them, he laughed at them and said Jesus was too intelligent to apply for political office.
The race remains exceptionally wide open.
Huckabee's ascent in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul's recent donation and his applause storms in the Wednesday debate.
These two have been shot out of nowhere, because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the more well-known and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate has united the party from the beginning and convincingly with a victorious message about the size of America and a twinkling on both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown discovered another pit to fall in; his way out of this remains the same.
For British scandals this is not particularly slippery.
No title seems to have been sold, no politician paid Paris hotel bills, no extramarital toes to be sold.
But the discovery that a wealthy businessman has spent more than 650,000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) for the British ruling Labour Party over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this, is something without Gordon Brown's struggle.
When two months ago the Prime Minister had withdrawn the request for an election, in a stupid way insulting the intelligence of the British by claiming that polls had not influenced this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly keen representative of the Liberal Democrats, expressed it, the formerly feared Brown from Stalin to Mr Bean.
The unsavoury rescue of Northern Rock, a beaten bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Badly thought-out proposals to amend tax laws have brought company associations against the government.
The tax-related loss of personal data of 25 million people showed unimaginable administrative fusseries.
A trio of retired generals started an uprising in the upper house from protesting against cuts in military spending: to be Minister of the Armed Forces, they claimed, is a part-time job.
Now there are the various donations by David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour's Secretary-General (and her former deputy director) has already resigned.
None of this means that Brown breaks in irrevocably direction of departure.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point where they feel impossible to govern.
No one likes or trusts politicians, but they usually hold back their skepticism when a new team takes office.
Once it is clear that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister will improve the situation, and he does not even need to be there for a long time, this postponement is over: the public service is beginning to get lost; the cabinet ministers are starting to chat; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is becoming defensive and aimless.
In a way, Brown's position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new broom.
As much as he would deny Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax liability documents, for example, are linked to decisions taken by Brown as Chancellor of the Ministry of Finance.
And even if he was not directly involved in Blair's misdemeanor - as in the long "money for noble title" investigation of political party financing - the voters may assume that he was.
But Brown's situation is not as bad as it looks.
The failures are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
Like Mr. Bean, no one died, or was completely defrauded.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown's naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new spirit of political donation is a good example.
The Garboeske of Abraham, who compares his donations with his charitable gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his goodwill.
This may be the case, but the decision was not acceptable to him.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
Watt, who says he knew about Abraham's agreement, but not that she is illegal, will of course have to ask himself some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's main financier, who was told about the extraordinary donations in October.
But so far Brown is not involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these confusions, although most of the payments were made after his takeover in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he watered this determination by grasping a well-known instrument, a committee of inquiry on the subject - in order to make the measure full, by a bishop in retirement and a judge.
In this case, the "learning lessons to be drawn" are not very complicated.
When the law is broken, it's a matter for the police.
There are other things that Mr Brown needs to do, such as finding something permanent for the independent Committee on Standards in public life, which has been unoccupied for six months, and progressing with a radical reform of political party funding.
This would require the Labour's hardliners to cooperate with the Conservatives and possibly abandon the special financial relationship with the trade unions - bitter pills for a party friend like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partial facts.
The Conservatives now have a clear lead in the polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can win is through indefensible justice and solid competence.
Card shark
Is the credit crisis in America related to the credit card market?
When blood is in the water, it's only natural that the back fins whirl around.
Now that America's real estate market is in violation, the predators have the credit card market of the country in sight.
Analysts from Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses could reach $99 billion when the risk of infection from underfunded loans spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both out-of-book and bond rates, which measure the share of loans that are not transferable or are too late for more than 30 days.
The HSBC announced last month that it had collected 1.4 billion dollars from its US consumer financing, partly due to the weakness of credit card recipients.
It's still too early to panic.
Losses and seams are still low.
According to Moody's credit rating agency, the third quarter total of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in the rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
A change in the US private insolvency laws in 2005 led to a abrupt case of bankruptcy applications, which in turn represent a large part of the credit card losses; the number of applications (and thus summary fees) would rise again, whether the general conditions for borrowers deteriorate or not.
Industry also reports on sound payment rates, which show how much of its debts consumers pay off each month
and trust in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the standstill in other corners of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup, a research company, expects that spending volumes for 2007 will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
Direct infection channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: it is more likely that consumers will absorb credit card debts, now that home loans are drying out.
The card exhibitors, however, look at the flow of money instead of capital, therefore falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the borrower's creditworthiness.
They can even be of benefit to card exhibitors.
Incentives for consumers to continue to pay mortgage rates fall if the real estate is less than the value of the loan; as a result, card debts become more important under the repayment priorities.
Card exhibitors can also react much faster and more flexibly than lenders to the more stormy conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of rapid revaluation of assets.
"We won't wake up one day and re-evaluate the loans completely," says Gary Perlin, Capital One's Chief Finance Officer.
Even if a sudden undercover crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustainable downturn are considerably more real.
If lower house prices and a credit reduction push America into recession, industry will undoubtedly face a more grim future.
Keep looking for these shark fins.
British benches confess guilty in the case of Enron
Three British bankers, who were to be brought to trial for their role in the fraudulent system with the former principal financial director of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their application to justice on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew originally pleaded innocently for the alleged conspiracy with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000, in order to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer, for seven cases of fraud.
The procedure had been initiated on January.
But during a hearing in court before U.S. district judge Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone pleaded guilty of a case of fraud using telecommunications funds.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became known in the UK during delivery procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, her case is a loose end to an investigation launched after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The allegations originally filed against them in 2002 pointed out to Fastow that he was the aim of a government investigation related to the Enron decline.
The charge against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to pluck out a fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top consultant Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a partnership of Enron controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron championships that have helped to tear the company into bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated the value of its participation in the subsidiary at zero, but the three British men knew that it really had significant value.
A company under Copper's control acquired the bank's shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid bankers $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the charge, Fastow wrongly charged Enron that the energy company would pay 20 million dollars to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
In fact, the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received 7.3 million dollars, while Fastow, Kopper and others sent about 12.3 million dollars, according to the charge.
In January 2004, Fastow confessed to a conspiracy in two charges for his role in the Enrons Pleite.
The British Trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is sentenced to six years in Louisiana Federal Prison.
Kopper has a term of three years and a month in a facility in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was free on the basis of a $1 million deposit that required them to live in the United States in expectation of the trial.
Enron, once the nation's seventh largest company, broke down in bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks could no longer cover up billions of debt or weakening businesses.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market values and more than two billion dollars of pension plans.
The Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year for their roles in connection with the Enron collapse.
Divorce is a penalty of more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were void after he died last year of heart disease.
Not at the bottom of Moscow
The price of an aircraft of the Gulfstream G550 brand, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and sufficient range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least 54 million dollars.
But that's small money for some of the rich Russians.
"It offers space for up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you asks for so many seats because it is for a private family or a corporate president."
Firer was at the Gulfstream booth on the last Friday at the Millionaires exhibition, a four-day orgy of displayed consumption, which was held in a staggered exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury providers had built exhibition stands, hoping to interest newly arrived Russians in everything, from mahogany-capped yachts to diamond-coated car grills that would be suitable for 50 cents.
In addition, a shiny orange Porsche was carefully taken into the vision at the next booth.
"That's a nice car, but it's small money compared to us," he said.
"According to the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Heated by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems flooded with money like Dallas at its heydays.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to gigantic wealth and went to Europe in crowds where they were regarded as materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi-Arab over-flyers of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians appear as the world's most open-ended donors.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share in the gold rush.
Otherwise in Moscow this week, a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH, attracted to exchange ideas on how to sell high-priced goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, which belongs to the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires who have a total of 282 billion dollars, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 133,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, worth a total of 670 billion dollars, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts of the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, an expert body here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005 15.8 percent of the Russians lived below the minimum of existence.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweller.
For the first time she had visited the fair together with the Russian dealer of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all well-kept, and the men are all worth a fortune."
While walking through the halls on Sunday night, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, call themselves and their clients millionaires.
"I looked for the cars and I tried to decide between the infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she wore, like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The fair seemed primarily to target the new empires, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to stand for several hours in storage to visit a plentiful warehouse that unswervingly placed Cadillac Escalades, platinum pocket knife, Mövenpick Eiskrem, custom-made billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund Teddy bears next to each other.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who was patriotically sitting at a booth of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a rembrandt image made of hand painted blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in Klimper climbers."
In fact, dealers here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old according to Russian standards) have already moved from large-scale logos to the type of sober brand with limited quantity that would not be marketed at a commercial show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millionaires, envoys of millionaires or simply tourists, pushed through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show on the last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil Beds said he had sold two 70,000 dollar mattress sets, made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with sewn gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with high-end alarm systems, said that his company had sold the gritty orange Porsche for $10,000 to a Russian millionaire.
Until Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, President of L.A. Connection, a company that adapts luxury cars to customer requirements, said that he would have sold three car cooler grilles for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, which are identical to the chain arm tires, each for $55,000.
He showed a reporter a car tire developed for a Russian casino owner with spokes he had covered with colored Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a roulette.
The cost: 22,000 dollars for a four.
"The Russian millionaire, who wants ostrich leather wheels or a picture of his wife's face from cubic zirconium, will not necessarily ride on these wheels," said Karapetian.
"He will keep it in his 30- or 40-car garage."
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russiche Millionaires" would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the increase in real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they are probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you believe."
Those who were not millionaires could do at least as if they were rich at a stand run by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four red telephone cells according to British model, which were filled with mountains of false millions of dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing director, said that his employees had printed 500,000 wrong banknotes for the millionaires trade fair.
Passersby stopped to throw the piles of money around, mobile phone photos, while they leaned back in the middle of the spare wealth, let friends take their lead, or just put a few million.
"Look, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Missed operation suspected death in New Jersey
It was the day before the harvest thank you as Ronald Livingston saw through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched as an ambulance on the white Cape Cod kept two doors down on West Scott Avenue.
Soon there was a police car.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the box of the medical body viewer coming," said Livingston, a restaurant supervisor, on Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew someone had died."
They heard that Ms. Olga Arroyo, who was dead, was an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to find out if she died because of a procedure carried out by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon who did not identify the police and who worked in the house on West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet determined what has caused Mrs Arroyo's death, and are hopeful that toxicological investigations whose results could not be available for weeks will help to clarify a mysterious death that has sent a mourning through the leadership of the Newark Police.
Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was well known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard-working and persistent," said Mr. McCarthy about Mrs. Arroyo in a telephon interview on Wednesday.
"She was my pitbull.
She protected me."
McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she leaves two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesman for the prosecutor of Union County, Theodore J. Romankow, said that investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgical treatment.
"That's one of the options," said Mrs. Walsh.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they arrived at the house at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon in November.
And they found Ms. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on the spot.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have communicated little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't want to tell me if Mrs. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
The investigators try to determine whether part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs. Castro's house, where a twisted rose tree stands in the narrow front garden and a Dalmatian calls behind the house.
A blue barrel labeled with "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - sat in the parking lot next to a door that led to the floor.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo was of invaluable value and helped him find his way into the provincial and hard political culture in his new city.
"She said, 'You have to pay attention to this or that," he said.
"She was always here when I got here and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hopes that the central bank will reduce interest rates will lead to an increase in global stock markets
Shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after market hopes that the central bank will try to calm the credit markets by further interest rate cuts, strengthened by alarming comments from the US Central Bank vice-president.
The stock markets rose in London, New York and throughout Europe after Donald Kahn, the number 2 of Ben Bernanke, the governor of the central bank, said that politics had to react "flexibly and pragmatically" to the ongoing pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure suspicious markets, given signs of rising credit tensions, Kohn said that the latest turbulences had "partly reversed some of the improvements in market functions from late September and October".
If the increased turbulence persisted, it would increase the possibility of further tightening the financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken up by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to step in and stabilise the credit conditions with new capital injections into the US markets and possible further interest reductions.
The statements also helped to calm down Wall Street, given further bad news from the US economy, now that US real estate sales reached a new record level in October.
The consequences of financial turbulence were underlined by the announcement of Bear Stearns, the Investment Bank, that they would eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of their global employees, in a cost-reducing measure to offset severe losses from their lost bets in the US mortgage credit sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these posts will disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 employees.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289,40, while the broader S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index increased by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent to close at 6,306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds to the value of British standard values.
Germany's index Dax increased by 2.6 percent and France's CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
Previously, the re-emergence of credit pressure on the markets had been underlined, after strong demand for an auction of three-month guarantee funds from the European Central Bank, granted to the European commercial banks, had been granted significant 4.7 percent, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England, the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank and to feed further capital into the money markets in London increased as the three-month "Libor" loan rate for the UK banks increased by 6.59 percent to its highest since late September, after a continuous increase since 21 November.
England confronts with decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here two dilemmas, each of them almost as difficult as the other.
Who's supposed to hit England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, not less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the election chairman, is calling at least under this special title, here to help the chief trainer Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan decide to do so, and because the table of High Morries, the English managing director, is gradually filling up with applications for national electorate, if not even for those in part-time.
Whoever does not get the sixth strike position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and the sport is undoubtedly.
It is never easy to pin down exactly what enables a person to reach the top of his profession, while someone else never gets beyond the lowest rank, sometimes out of lack of luck instead of ability.
It is not only in the cricket, where the selection is difficult, where judgements are necessary that are always subjective at the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same may also be asked in another area, for example, whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young managers with good grades who know the business well, should be promoted.
Who can say what is the right class for a cricket player unless he is given the opportunity to swim or go down.
Of course, numbers have a major influence on decisions, but opportunities do.
Within a team, a cricket player must catch the captain's eye at the right time, if he can take a wicket and a bat must get regular chances on the order if he wants to make an impression as a one-day cricket player.
Catching the eyes of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who in the last season were better than, for example, James Anderson, who apparently will play in the first test, even if Stephen Harrison explains himself to be healthy and how the wind cones into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class Wickets with 33 runs each to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hoped for more.
Whether Shah or Bopara are playing at the Asgiriya Stadium can only be a point of view.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it may make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five Wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, at that time still struggling to consolidate himself, who made the breakthrough into a major test-kicket player and who, although he scored a double hundred against Australia in Australia, may still be underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, will follow their conservative instincts and gut feelings for Shah's greater experience of Bopara's youthful enthusiasm after a further discussion at the Asgiriya Stadium.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable 88 test debut in Bombay speaks 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, who is seven years younger at the age of 22, and an excellent balance against turned balls.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the test in Lord, his home arena as a player from Middlesex, and this, plus his immediate rejection of the voters when Vaughan was healthy to take back his position for the next game, seems to have taken the swing out of his stroke, which was still evident in Bombay.
In contrast, the all-rounder from Essex enjoys life.
He is not impressed by anything on a cricket pitch and his attitude was brought to the point when he recently had a four-wheeled vehicle in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to get out his vodafone (of course also sponsored) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had observed this from afar, and with enthusiasm say, "Have you seen this?".
Bopara is a much better field player, he contaminates his mid-tempo with some effect here on the playing fields, which seems to fit him and strikes with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, the right time to choose another.
Maybe that's the actual art of choice.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which does not mean that Shah may not be there well, if, as the tea set from Ceylon suggests, he is the one who will play here this weekend.
Buss bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Quaida
The first busloads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived yesterday in Baghdad, with a stream of displaced persons whose funds or visas have expired, and others who hoped that the city would return to normality.
Some had even come back to fight the rebels they had expelled from their homes.
At Mansour Bus Station, before arriving 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy from a dozen buses, the terminal was operational with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transports.
"I decided to go to Syria after killing many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni physician.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspaper, about what happened in Baghdad, and how it was safe now."
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, with regard to the Shiite militias of the militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to return at this time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the Iraqi regime was not allowed to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local militia supported by the U.S. has helped drive Al-Qaeda out of her bastion in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been expelled from his house in Sleith in northern Baghdad by a hand grenades attack after he had asked his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaeda.
He had come back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started an anti-Al Qaida militia in Sleith and that they needed my support and those of my boys.
That's why I returned today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many reported that they had been attracted by the increasing tranquillity in the capital since the U.S. increase and the growth of local "groups affected" citizens, who armed and defend their districts in cooperation with the American military.
But more spoke of having been forced home by visa problems and abetting funds in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old father of three times, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, who had requested the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees in order to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have probably fled the sectarian death squads in the country.
"We went well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government urged the Iraqis no longer to give visas to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunni pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunni were expelled from Shiite residential areas and vice versa, which led to the creation of many places where tensions have left behind.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will re-establish sectarian tensions and conflicts.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state is a leader in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in one field of education does the Saarland express the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I told a non-sairy country yesterday for the 50th time that we are not French" - this slogan presents the smallest state itself ironically for its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland educational system, which is in the educational monitor of the Institute of the German Economy Cologne (IW) in fifth place.
For example, the universities already cooperate closely from tradition with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To date, students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple diploma.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is 15.6 percent.
But also the country children bring the Saarland in an above average number to the universities - many of them without a degree at the high school.
"In Saarland, the vocational education system is used," says Axel Plünnecke, educational expert at the IW.
More than every five young people acquire their right to study at a vocational school, so Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the Federal average.
The combination of vocational and academic training is also highly developed.
The second best in Germany is the provision of dual courses, measured by the population.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by one third in recent years.
That is why the Ministry of Education of Saarland has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
"After the first Pisa study, we started a number of reforms in the general schools," says a spokesperson from the Ministry of Education.
The government thus introduced nationwide comparative tests.
For children to start learning earlier, the last Kita year is free of charge - a model that now also copy other federal states.
Whether pupils' performance improves sustainably will only show future comparison studies.
At Pisa 2003, the proportion of risk students dropped from 29 to 20 percent.
Overall, however, Saarland did not increase as strongly as other Länder.
Bayern's better off.
And to the drudgery of the Saarland, foreign language skills are not measured at Pisa - otherwise one could point out in this area.
For the language of the neighbours is mandatory for high schools - even if the Saarlands are not French.
Chávez modifies the clocks
In Venezuela the clocks will tick differently soon than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December President Hugo Chávez has the timepiece in the South American country turned back by half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez becomes a joke figure.
As the Official Journal of Venezuela announced, a new law states that clocks will be set to world times less than four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone which there is no other country in the world.
The U.S. enemy Chávez justified his decision, among other things, that the United States of the world had imposed the division into time zones to full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced the termination of relations with the neighbouring country of Colombia due to a hostage affair on Wednesday (local time).
The Left Nationalist said as long as the Conservative Alvaro Uribe President of Colombia remains, he will not have relations with either the Head of State or the Colombian Government.
"I cannot do this alone because of my dignity," said Chávez, who is driving forward a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the Alliance must vote in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would significantly expand his power in the country.
The result of the dispute was the decision by Uribes to withdraw Chávez from the mandate to negotiate with Marxist rebels in Colombia, where it was about the release of hostages.
Uribe had spit in Venezuela's face with his decision, and Chávez had criticized him on Sunday.
Chávez is also in the mouth of Spain.
A new cell phone ring in the country provides fear: "Por qé no te callas" (Why don't you keep your mouth shut) is the sentence that has already downloaded more than half a million people from the Internet.
Spain's King Juan Carlos spoke to him, who at the recent Iberoamerican summit was engrossed by the constant interlocutor of the left populist and had run it over his mouth.
Germans threaten 2007 Lohnenminus
Despite the strong economic situation, German workers are forecast to lose real wages this year.
Experts called a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, the employees in 2007 could really count with less on the salary account than in the previous year.
"The blame for this is the modest wage development, the increase in VAT and the price burden on food and energy," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Business Research of the "Image" newspaper.
New loads could also apply to employees in unemployment insurance.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück said the "Neuen Osnabrücker Zeitung", the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 per cent by the turn of the year was correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, if the Federal Employment Agency is not to be embarrassed to have to ask for loans or grants, the SPD politician has been quoted.
On Tuesday it was announced that the price explosion in food and petroleum products has driven inflation to the highest level for 13 years.
Total prices rose by 3.0 per cent year-on-year.
Venus is the hellish twin of the earth
Despite its life-threatening atmosphere, Venus is thought to be more similar than ever: The European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightnings in the atmosphere and wind whirls on the Poles, as they occur on earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected that Venus has flashed.
Now the European "Venus Express" probe has been proven - it detected electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: The lightnings on Venus shoot at a height of about 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, Christopher Russel reports from the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "Ursuppen theory", lightning has created life on earth: thunderstorms should have stimulated reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If there ever was a life there, it must have been in the very early history," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today there should be hardly any living thing on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on earth, it is sometimes under temperatures of 500 degrees.
"The Venus may be the devil's twin of the earth, but it's a twin," said Russel.
Why the Venus, which is so similar to the Earth in mass and size, has taken on such a completely different development, is the fundamental question of the Esa mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, since since the beginning of the nineties no more probes were dedicated to exploring this planet.
According to the researchers, the latest research results presented in several "nature" articles underline not only the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"They also show that the similarities between our neighbouring planet and the Earth are larger than initially assumed," says Esa.
In addition to the already known whirlwind at the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud strangle at the South Pole, which rotates much faster.
The phenomenon reminds of air currents on the earthly winter hemisphere, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the earth and is almost as large with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.
The planet, also known as the morning or evening star, crisscross the sun in almost 225 days.
But he turns around much slower: A Venus day takes 243 days on earth.
Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar is hardly reminiscent of the Earth, scientists assume that both planets were formed under quite similar conditions.
Both of them gathered water that remained on earth in oceans, but on which Venus was lost in space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on Earth in carbonate rocks, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler demands an end to the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's Office.
Indirectly he criticized the SPD for their attacks on the chancellor after the September meeting.
Federal President Horst Köhler takes care of Germany's reputation and has called on the great coalition to end the dispute to receive the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present a divided nation to the outside world in this matter," Köhler said to the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler signaled understanding of the Dalai Lama's reception by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"The human rights have universal validity for me, even though I have respect for the diversity of cultures," said Köhler.
Anyone knows that Germany had to maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, stressed the Federal President, but took Merkel in protection from the accusation, they run a new China policy.
"The Federal Chancellor has not removed the traditional one-China policy.
China knows that too," said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had expressed indirect dismay at the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from a number of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier had complained about the Union's "window policy" in foreign policy.
After receiving the Dalai Lamas in the chancellor's office, there were severe irritations in the German-Chinese relationship.
In this way the Chinese leadership not only invited the German finance minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also, according to information from the SPIEGEL, frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries.
China's head of government Wen Jiabao has now asked Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit the reception of the Dalai Lama as a mistake.
China denied it when European politicians officially received the religious leaders of the Tibetans, Wen Jiabao reaffirmed the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama showed that he was trying to separate Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other current provinces, from China.
Schäuble warns against Krawallen as in France
Street battles with the police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against Krawallen as in France.
Everything had to be done to prevent social dissatisfaction in Germany from being discharged into violence on the streets, the Federal Minister for Internal Affairs demanded.
Barricades burned, Randaliers shot at the police with shotguns: Federal Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany after the heavy youth gangs in France.
"We need to make sure that we do not also build up and discharge ourselves into violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said the "New Press" in Hanover.
Not every young person can cope with the rapid change of social reality.
The Federal Republic of Germany, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Federal Republic of Germany have already worked with emphasis on reducing problems, said Schäuble.
This is not only about the integration of migrants.
"From the Summit of Integration to the Islamic Conference, this is already the first success."
However, it is too early for detachment.
Schäuble also pointed out that there were no urban and sociological problems in German suburbs as in France.
In northern suburbs of Paris, young people had delivered heavy street battles with the police in the past nights.
In Toulouse, cars and public buildings also burned.
Major integration efforts of the Federal Government, however, demanded the chairman of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the Krawalle in France, Kolat warned against "navigation effects".
The situation in Germany was not as bright as it was in France.
However, there is a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate for young people under 25 years of age was "over-averaged".
There was a need, above all, for more training places to be provided.
Kolat stressed: "We must give young people a perspective."
However, the chairman of the Turkish community added that in Germany more than in France "social control takes place in the families".
Moreover, many young people with migrant backgrounds did not want to destroy what their parents had built up here.
Kolat warned: "But we still have to be careful."
It was necessary to give young people "a quick opportunity to participate in work and training".
Meanwhile it remained largely quiet at night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police forces were in operation, a helicopter flew over the area with headlights.
The competent authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning garbage buckets and cars.
Since the day before, an offer of about 1000 security forces has provided peace.
The police will get through as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburb.
On Tuesday, about 80 police officers had been injured at Krawallen in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the follow-up night, unrest took over Toulouse.
The Krawalls were inflamed by a traffic accident that killed two young people on Sunday.
According to the first knowledge of the prosecution, the police are not responsible for the death of the young.
In the realm of Angela Wolke
The firm's remote appearance demonstrates that the coalition's content is at the end - and that there is nothing to be expected of itself.
In which country does this Chancellor actually live?
After her inconsolable appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was wretched and low in content, one has to say: not here - not in the country that should finally be ruled by her.
The allegation that they focused too much on foreign policy has been rejected by Angela Merkel with an extremely overly high sentence.
That is provincial, she said, and first showed that she does not want to understand what the critics are about.
In the Bundestag, it has documented for everyone how much their accusations are.
There was neither a concrete interest nor a feeling of concern for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented himself: an abducted politician who flees into foreign policy and even stays in trouble there.
For example, climate protection: because it praises the decisions of Heiligendamm unstoppably, it does not say how to achieve climate targets in this country.
Above all, the self-loath - so much modesty the CDU boss had failed two years ago.
Now she clings to the floss that the upswing comes to the people.
In doing so, she damages her image as a pragmatist who solves the problems rather than discuss the world nicely.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke, domestic political problems are a farce.
Child poverty and the worries of the lowly ones?
She's left with a few supplements.
It is significant how often it promises when it comes to childbirth.
Three approaches need Merkel there to bring out a half straight set.
It stumbles like on a foreign terrain, if it becomes concrete.
Attack Department
In the YouTube debates of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney deliver a hard strike - and now have to fear an outside candidate.
The suspense of the candidates is already eroded on the first topic.
He has made New York a place of refuge for illegal immigrants, and Mitt Romney is launching his contravenant Rudy Giuliani.
On the other hand, this countered with serious accusations: "I would say that his own house was a port of illegals," Giuliani replied, suggesting to the former Governor of Massachusetts to employ private immigrants without paperwork.
The candidates are blowing up the attack: because the Republican base still has no clear favorites, the eight presidential candidates are using the debate on CNN to discredit their opponents.
The self-rotated 30-second video that Internet users have sent via YouTube is hardly more than just a keyword.
"With this kind of isolationism, we have let Hitler come to power," John McCain accuses his contrahensor Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round calling for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also receives strong reading from the Vietnam veterans of the Levites when he refuses to condemn the so-called "waterboarding", an interrogation method in which drowning is simulated as torture.
However, the fact that the main themes of the campaign are now beyond Iraq's war and torture debates shows the reactions of the Saal public in St. Petersburg in Florida.
When conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected, applause is sounded in the auditorium.
Once again it shows where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney said, "and in front of the base and the television audience, he denied that he was still one of the abortion advocates in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, comes into the sling when, in his opinion, he is asked for the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf first rules civil
One day after his resignation as army chief, the Pakistani ruler Musharraf has been defended as president.
This will end eight years of military domination in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President, Pervez Musharraf, has been sworn on Thursday for another five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live in the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the Constitution and to act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday he had handed over his post as army chief to his associate Ashfaq Kiyani and thus bowed to international pressure especially from the USA.
Eight years after his seizure of power in an unbloody military coup, the former general now rules for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With his resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a core demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is an end to the state of emergency imposed by Musharraf on 3 November.
Soon after his defense, Musharraf will, according to General Attorney Malik Muhammad Qayyum, remove the state of emergency and thus meet another demand from the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied with him weighted lawyers at the beginning of November after the death of the state of emergency, had rejected all allegations against the disputed re-election of the Head of State on 6 October last week.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern Tribal Region of North Waziristan in one attack on a military convoy and four more wounded.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The Fathers of Krautrock Return
Germany's Supergruppe of the Seventies again plays: The three band members of Harmonia took their consoles up again at a concert in Berlin.
To the Revival appears an average from their great time "Live 1974".
Even then, they were much more famous abroad.
The appropriate sensation then takes place in the shape of three set men at the dinner table.
Everyone has his box in front of him, his cables and, above all, his buttons.
Dieter Moebius crowns in a flower-white shirt with 63 years in the middle.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years young and owned by laptop and guitar.
On the right, from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, is focused on the console.
Everyone's wearing noises, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally adds to a traditional piece of music.
This does not seem to disturb the gentlemen themselves.
That the band Harmonia is playing again has caused some excitement under Krautrock lovers.
In which one may reveal here: Targeted demands revealed that the name, although papered by collective pop memory, was not so sustainable in order to miss this band painfully for 32 years.
But why should not the German also celebrate his living legends from the seventies?
Especially in England and America, what is called misleading Krautrock was always more important than in their own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize for Life's Work to the survivors of the Cologne group Can 2003, it was seen in questioning German pop faces in the hall.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked themselves at the Laudatio at the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu!, the surprise knew no bounds.
At concerts, Michael Rother later cheered on stage at the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old buddy.
The problem of ignorance at home and the transfiguration in the stranger is one.
The memory is already overburdened with harmony because the trio existed only two years and at that time also developed a much lower power of effect than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
First they played under the Berliner Schaubühne in the cellar.
Afterwards in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label kept by the Church.
Rother had briefly helped out at Kraftwerk and then acted as a guitarist at Neu!, the perhaps most radical German group at the time.
At about 1973, however, Rother followed the cluster musicians in exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as a fugitive city.
Less ideological than in the municipality I, where Roedelius was still allowed to suffer as a nanny.
It's more like a retarded artist's presence.
It is said that a wimpel of the Harmonia Ottenstein singing club and a name for art was found in the Sperrmüll.
Some of them held Harmonia.
The first album was called "Music of Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
For so quiet and modest the music also sounded, the band suffered material distress.
The rice collection did not serve alone in self-finding.
The CD "Live 1974" now released was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a record scene of almost 50 people, as someone thinks he is missing.
At the time, von Rother wanted to force and occasionally practise harmony.
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral demand.
The band declared its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the Esoteric-Spherical and secured his existence with albums like "flaming hearts".
Cluster was revived in the eighties and has been more successful ever since it was Harmonia.
The Grimessemer Livealbum is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its record company Greenland has set itself the goal of maintaining Krautrock as an original German contribution to living music.
New! was already excavated like Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin Haus der Kulturen der Welt.
Publicly subsidized, within the framework of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is there, the Briton, Altpunk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There's also the love parade inventor Dr. Motte.
The whole range of the influences of the Krautrock on the following pop music would be outlined.
Harmonia fills the space of the supergroup.
The sentence of Brian Eno floats with the most extraordinary sounds in the hall: "The only true music you have is the future."
There are pictures showing the producers with harmony in the farmhouse.
The legend is used for projections of other black and white photos of our wired devices.
Before that, the three veterans are again involved in improvisation.
No more by attaching microphones to the organ and to the drums to unscrew the instruments via self-made effects devices unheard of tones.
Today electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three to the Technically Intensive Tüftler.
There is no change in the choir of the house.
Under Barbara Morgenstern's direction, sound clouds are coughed and whisked and sung at a beautiful spot with emphase "Aaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never about rock.
The roots were sought less in the blues than in music colleges (can), technologies (power works) or on the escape from artistic and social conventions (clusters).
Whoever calls here "'68!" is not quite wrong, and Harmonia can't get away with it even now.
Even the most obvious is thoroughly considered on stage.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can give you great happiness from the nerves or fleeting moments.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough
"The Hunting Party" and "Murderary Peace" are again dealing with two films of the Balkan War.
But both do not convince.
Either the concepts put too much on action and baller or they are too touching.
Richard Gere can't help in "The Hunting Party."
The good news first: Although war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but calculated there, in the gloomy hinterland of the Bosnia war, the actor Richard Gere has now been found again.
We had lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, because all too many nice-interesting roles in well-being films for women and too many press conferences on Buddhism have driven us to look.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to consider himself "The Hunting Party - If the hunter becomes a hunt" (Why must film titles today always be as long and will be like locator tariff agreements?) perhaps?
He provides a wonderful eye-catching presentation: basically his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have been done if fate and the film industry were not so gracious: a man who has his very best times behind him for a long time, but who, as a ruinous monument, still has considerable remains of his once charm.
But despite this trump, "The Hunting Party" together with the German production "Murderary Peace", which also starts this week, only continues the endless series of failed Balkan war films.
With "Murderary Peace" one can make a short process: The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who rescue a Serbin from Kosovar hedge-keepers, on which one immediately falls in love.
Although it is welcome that not even the Serbs are represented here as the sole root of all evils, the distant sea flat film loses itself too quickly in baller and action.
There remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but for that with war.
On the other hand, you can find out exactly why there has never been a really good Balkan war film at The Hunting Party.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who open up to detect the Serbian war criminal "the Fuchs" could perhaps have become a new "apocalypse Now" with another director and screenwriter (both in HR Richard Shepard).
Because the stories look like a frenzy: Both times small teams go to the woods to accomplish something the military can't do, and both times it's going to be a journey in madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that Simon Hunt is not simply allowed to be the fallen cynic with the heart when he is introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script also has a romantic affair with a Muslim boss who was later murdered.
"The Hunting Party" then goes down the stream when the reporters succeed in the time-lapse process within the last five minutes, what Nato, CIA and all the bounty hunters of the world have failed in five years: catching the war criminals and leaving the Muslim Bosnians to justice.
This is so bad that you want to call the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against the cinema.
The film has a deep human concern.
He wants to suggest that Karadzic and Mladic are still running freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (there they should exceptionally agree) not to pursue the persecution too intensely because of secret political agreements.
But the good idea and evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
It says about the wood mask of an Asian demon on the poet's worktop: "I sympathize with the swollen bullnades, implying: how strenuous it is to be evil."
Films like "The Hunting Party" have just such swelling heads, but they suggest how strenuous it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan war film.
Recently, this newspaper reported that all of the Hollywood Iraqi films were big flops.
You can add: There has never been a good South Africa film either.
Almost always, if a star wanders around the world on crisis herds or minefields, something like "Rangoon" comes out with Patricia Arquette, "Jones of all Borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blut Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Perhaps all the conflicts are too close in time.
After all, it had to be decades before Hollywood was able to film a good film about the Holocaust with "Schindler's List".
Some films will probably still mature - the Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" now considered as classic have not been celebrated unanimously as masterpieces at the time.
But maybe today we know where every mass murder comes home on two screens in real time, even just too much about the world's conflicts.
And this robs the scriptwriters of the carelessness it takes to tell good stories.
After all, "His or Nothing" or "The Great Dictator" have become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin didn't know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you can't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Maybe you have to have the sarcasticly distanced artist view of the Romancier Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel Lemprière's dictionary and the Balkan War, he replied: "This is only because some things never change.
Large cities will always be horrificly dangerous, people will always be murdered in a cruel way and war will always prevail in Yugoslavia."
Beust reaps criticism for Olympia Absage
The demise of the mayor of Hamburg's application for Summer Olympics has come under strong criticism of politics and the economy.
Many want to continue fighting for the games on the water.
But Beust admonishes realism in the assessment of the chances.
The Chief Executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, declared on Wednesday a waiver as "not good for the business location".
No other project has recently developed as large motivational forces in the city as the Olympiaidee.
"Without this objective, the sporting policy momentum would not be able to be maintained to the same extent."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project but to find a new long-term approach to "from a changed timeline".
Mayor Ole von Beust stayed with previous statements on Wednesday, according to which the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic at least until 2028.
"Not Hamburg decides on an Olympic application, but the Deutsche Olympic Sportbund," said Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Federation on an application for Munich for the 2018 Winter Games, which was expected for the beginning of December.
"This preference means, for us, that we will not have a realistic chance in the period we have thought of until 2028."
Nevertheless, the dream was not dreaming for all time, said Beust.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) regretted the statements of Beusts.
This gives the impression that Hamburg will no longer apply for Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to build a chance by burying the plans already at this time," said HSB President Günter Ploss on Wednesday.
An absence of the application also contradicts the Senate Head's statement on the occasion of a reception to the General German Association of Higher Education.
There by Beust described Hamburg's application for the Universiade 2015 as "not a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Hochschulesportverband had only nominated Hamburg as a candidate city last week.
The SPD Citizenship faction accused the Senate of not using valuable time for housing construction in Hamburg.
"The development of the Little Grassbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it has placed it on the map of Olympia and has blocked the construction of the apartment," said SPD members Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for the Kleinen Grasbrook had always demanded integrated planning for Olympia and later use of housing, the CDU had placed one side on the "event factor".
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics had given rise to a great enthusiasm in Hamburg at the time.
Hamburg, however, failed in Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
Whoever connects the terms Sweden and wooden chests is thinking of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Isn't it?
Currently fabricated wooden boxes cast dark shadows on Warhol's work directory in Sweden.
Most of the Brillo boxes of the "Type Stockholm" listed there are fakes.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago has scorched doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes of the year 1968, internal research at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm is now coming to a sobering conclusion: the six "Brillo boxes", which the former museum director Pontus Hultén has made to the Moderna Museet in 1995, are copies - and most of the approximately one hundred other Brillo boxes of "Type Stockholm", which are in circulation on the international art market.
The history of premise is staggering, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
Warhol created his first "Brillo boxes" in New York in 1964, painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard of the soap powder "Brillo".
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet in 1968, with Warhol's consent, produced hundreds of Brillo boxes from cardboard: These were not from Warhol for cost reasons, but were delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
It was not works of art, but their role models, just exhibits.
At the same time, in 1968, Warhol probably granted permission to produce a few Brillo wood chests in Sweden, which, however, were not exhibited in the Moderna Museet.
Zeitzeugen are now speaking of about fifteen crates, which at that time have been included in the art and auction history as authorised andy-warhol-brillo boxes called "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have achieved more than 100 000 dollars in auctions.
The problem is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later wrongly claimed that it had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, that Warhol had then left him.
In fact Hultén's 105 crates were only produced in Malmö in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, Chief Conservator at Moderna Museet, has also investigated three Swedish private owned Brillo boxes, of which two were manufactured in Stockholm in 1968: their press circuit boards were first grounded and smelted, and then white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The structure of the 1990 copies, on the other hand, reveals that the colour was applied directly to the press plate without any foundation - it is not oil, but acrylic.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes," says the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to a different conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition material."
As early as July, the Authentication Board announced to investigate the "serious allegations" raised in the case of soap powder boxes.
But since then, one has shrouded oneself there in unspeakable silence.
Rebelling soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who had taken refuge in a hotel in Manila called for the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He could not be responsible for bloodshed, said leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and electoral fraud, reporters in the hotel.
Government-led soldiers had previously stormed the hotel under tear gas.
The approximately two dozen soldiers had been hiding in the building for hours.
About half of them were in court on Thursday because of a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly set off with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police, who were supposed to guard him, apparently walked over to him and joined in his mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyale government troops blocked the district for the nice hotel.
The president called for an urgent meeting of the security cabinet.
The National Security Advisor Norberto Gonzales condemned the action of the soldiers.
"People have enough," said Trillanes.
"We call on the people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who formerly ordered the elite unit of the Scout Rangers, said that other army units wanted to join the march shortly.
Government critics had called for large demonstrations against the President for Friday.
Her government has been overestimated by accusations of corruption for months.
Manila's financial district was already the main scene of attempted mutiny by about 200 military members against Arroyo in 2003.
The uprising failed after almost 24 hours at the refusal of the army to join.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven attempts at coup against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder in Versatel
United Internet has secured a share of more than 20 percent in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as the company announced on Wednesday evening.
20.05 percent of the capital is now held.
A takeover had previously been speculated.
The option to increase the share of Versatel remains open.
The aim of the step is to advance the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet announced.
Previously, suspicions had already arisen on Wednesday, after the Berenberg Bank increased its participation in the Düsseldorf network operator by another 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The money house held the shares only for a third party, called it the financial market.
On the day before, United Internet had already participated in the mobile company Drillisch with just under 10 percent.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch has placed 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros.
United Internet has purchased 5.15 million shares for EUR 31.4 million.
In addition, the companies have entered into discussions on marketing cooperations for DSL and mobile products.
"We are strengthening our partnership," explained a United-Internet speaker.
The two companies set up the joint venture MSP to take over the competitors Freenet.
First of all, the two companies want to be satisfied with a share of more than ten percent of Freenet and not make use of their right to take over another 18.49 percent of Freenet, United Internet announced on Thursday.
However, the two companies remained open to all options, in particular to further increase their participation in Freenet AG, it said.
Discussions between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had been concluded in mid-November.
The persistent and only hard to see poker around Freenet has been part of the consolidation of the German telecoms market.
Freenet had 2.9 million mobile contract customers and 1.27 million DSL and complete connection customers at the end of the third quarter.
So far, United Internet and Drillish holding held 6,01 percent of the freenet shares.
Now it has been agreed that Drillisch will bring in another around four percent.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas had already been agreed in August.
