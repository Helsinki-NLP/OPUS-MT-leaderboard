DFB Chief Grindel sees no basis for oozil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel sees no basis for a return of Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question which, of course, depends on one getting into the conversation, that one also talks with him about why he has apparently felt something like that in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasenmaher" of the "picture newspaper.
Despite the now monthly debate on the photos of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regretted the resignation of the 92-time national player Özil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued playing for Germany.
I also assumed at some point that this would be so," said Grindel.
The 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and also explained that he had not defended him against racist animosities during the World Cup.
The DFB chief repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with Federal Trainer Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build up pressure, but he knows it from football so that if "you leave a team or change an association you talk about it with his coach and I find it a pity that this conversation has not been done so far".
Linz: Garden cottage in Schrebergarten settlement burned
At 2:13 p.m., the Linz Professional Fire Department was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly across the Schrebergarten settlement, danger was delayed.
The professional fire brigade ran out and found out when the hut arrived in full fire.
The roof had to be completely removed and fireproofed to an absolutely necessary extent.
According to the owners of the burning garden cottage, he had a battery attached to the shop at lunchtime.
That could be the cause of the fire.
In any case, the charger was in the area of the greatest fire intensity, according to the fire brigade.
The damage caused by the fire still needs to be determined - as well as the cause of the fire.
However, he is likely to be considerable because the owner had many collectors' items in his garden cottage.
Angry Mother resists: Lindsay Lohan attacks the refugee family on the open road
What only led Lindsay Lohan to this strange action?
Apparently, she was trying to drag the children away from a alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has even streamed live as she seems to want to tear away the children from a family in Moscow.
This reports the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial integration of the stream.
Here you see "Kissing lucky" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows Lohan getting out of a car and going to a possibly homeless family that she wants to be a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flees from the actress, Lohan pursues the parents and their children.
She's ordering the adults to trade children.
For all that, she doesn't give any evidence in the clip.
"The whole world sees this right," Lohan is listening in the video as she continues to follow the family along the road.
Apparently, she tries to separate the children from her parents.
At some point, however, the obviously angry mother seems to be enough.
Looks like she's turning around and Lohan's missing an earlash.
Under tears, the actress acts as shocked as she is - and she keeps her cheek.
What has moved Lohan to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The Hayabusa2 probe started in December 2014 in Japan.
It's supposed to get so close to Ryugu, the asteroid, that it can apply material from its surface and bring it to the ground.
The lander "Mascot" will stay on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: The number of dead on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of the strength 7.5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 420 deaths are reported.
The number of victims could increase even further.
The rescue teams are not yet in the devastated and remote areas.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla Supervisory Board
At the beginning was a tweet.
Tesla-Chief Elon Musk caused a disturbance in the stock markets at the beginning of August when he announced the withdrawal of the Eletro Automaker.
The U.S. stock exchange monitor sued him for fraud, but now both agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and Tesla's boss is withdrawing from the Supervisory Board, but he may remain Chairman of the Board.
UK Conservative Party
Sharply guarded - the party day of the Tories
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
The party's meeting is due to deal with foreign policy, trade and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, at the forefront of former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a New State Name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these names for years.
Now they've agreed.
The state of Macedonia will be called northern Macedonia and the population will vote on this Sunday - whether it is good?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The Not") - meaning Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential elections in Brazil, the mood in the country is split.
Thousands went to the streets in several cities to protest against right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" presents itself as an anti-system candidate and thus lies ahead in the polls.
His fiercest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers' Party.
Audi: "Delegate" processing takes longer than planned
"The Diesel Task Force is still in place," said development director Peter Mertens, the industry sheet "Automobilwoche".
In December 2017, the arrested and retired Audi Chief Rupert Stadler announced that the task force would soon be dissolved.
"All engine/gear combinations are expected to be tested in the first quarter of 2018," he said at that time.
Mertens said: "At the beginning of July, we reached an important stage in the process of the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The task force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at the Audi mother Volkswagen.
Mertens pointed out that the car builder had made "encumbering organizational changes" so that such a scandal would never occur again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and will continue to discuss this Tuesday.
The investigation authorities propose that the Audi Chief have, after being known, authorised the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust values.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
At present, Bram Schot is head of the company as Chief Executive Officer.
Due to the change to the new emission and consumption test standard WLTP there are production failures at Audi, said Schot the "Heilbronn voice".
Basically, he sees a falling demand for limousines such as the Audi Models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Shot's on electromobility.
There were already 15 000 reservations for the e-tron, the first Audi electric car.
Grindel strives to re-election - Lahm is to be in the DFB presidium
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants to run the DFB President again for office next year despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup Aus and the Ozil affair.
"I do my work and try to do it as well as I can," said Grindel as a guest at the ZDF's "Current Sports Studio" on the early Sunday morning.
You have to keep trying to re-election, I will.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
In his own words, the head of the association found it "wonderful" if he did not "listen to work on the future project" after the supplement for the football EM 2024.
Grindel has been head of the Federation since April 2016 as a successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who has died over the summer fairy tale affair.
In the autumn of 2016 he was elected for the first full term of three years.
The next vote will take place on 27 September 2019 at the DFB Bundestag.
According to Grindel, the future EM organizer Philipp Lahm is to work in the DFB presidium.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that he would also advise on this role in the future in the Bureau and then, of course, be warmly invited to make his experience available on sporting questions," said Grindel.
In speculation that Lahm could become his successor as DFB chief, he did not want to participate.
As a consequence of the affair around the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in future a national player should become a DFB without a migration background.
Currently this office of native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic has been held, the latter has family roots in Cameroon.
"If there is a person who has a clear impact on society and football without a migration background and says, "the topic is important, we have to take care of it", that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations on the ground where integration must work," said Grindel.

Basketball League: Clear turnout for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin started with a clear victory in the new season of the basketball league.
With 112:55 (52:31), the Vice-Chancellor defeated Science City Jena and offered a convincing game for over 40 minutes.
New entry Rokas Giedraitis was with 20 points top scorer of the dominant Berliner.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 counter) from Ludwigsburg also showed an appealing performance before 9113 spectators in his compulsory play debut.
Ex-Meister Brose Bamberg won with 84:80 (39:37) with coach Ainars Bagatskis in his compulsory play debut at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was among the guests with 24 best throwers.

The new gamemaker Will Cummings overtook the Oldenburgers with 25 counters.
The Braunschweiger, in which NBA-Star Dennis Schröder has been a majority shareholder since the start of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the basketballs quickly ensured clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism to Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan invited the German government to deliver Gülen moving followers living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens - no matter where they live.
We will not allow the sympathizers of the PKK or the guild movement to shake our citizens and harm the German-Turkish friendship," he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, the city centre of Cologne had been partially blocked.
Several thousand policemen were in use - among them also sharpshooters.
The Islamic Association Ditib stands in criticism because it is considered to be an extended arm of the Turkish government.
Global Citizen Festival: Music Against Poverty: Stars, Buhrufe and Horror Seconds
Musicians like Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have won a concert at the New York Central Park for more commitment in the fight against poverty and diseases.
"Involves you wherever you can, wherever you can", Mendes said at the festival during the night to Sunday before about 60.0000 spectators.
Thanks for coming here, it's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with fringes and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I sweat, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and relief organizations were also on stage at the multi-hour spectacle.
In the meantime, however, there was a horrific second, when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal barrier for shots was afraid and tried to escape.
In a short time, panic arose, people ran into each other.
Seven spectators were easily injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
However, the New York police and the musician Chris Martin calmed the people from the stage.
"No one tries to hurt anyone," said Martin.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge every year on the Internet.
Anyone who wanted to meet had to read and spread texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and disease on the Internet.
For the numerous musicians and actors there were cheers and applause from the audience - Buhrufe for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
This, together with his democratic colleague Chris Coons, spoke out on stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had spoken out in the US Senate Judicial Committee for the nomination of Kavanaugh Board as Judge at the Supreme Court and thus had many women come to mind.
At least three women have filed accusations of abuse until attempted rape against Kavanaugh, who rejects it.
Flake demanded an FBI investigation of allegations after he faced two women who reportedly experienced sexual assaults themselves on the way to committee meetings in an elevator.
"You are also welcome to meet me at any time in an elevator," Flake said at the concert in New York about the audience.
Press freedom: Federal government defends journalist's robbery
Government spokesperson Steffen Seibert defended a journalist's appeal from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
At the chancellor's office, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had transferred a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone to the first row.
The T-shirt, if not the problem, said Seibert the picture on Sunday.
It was about a disruption of the press conference's course.
The journalist's action caused a great deal of unrest, which was unacceptable.
That's why he made people's protectors bring the man out.
Sheibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellor's Office.
This applies completely regardless of whether or not it is a legitimate concern.
The rules are the rules.
Many journalists are in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are allegedly accused of spying or of support or membership in prohibited parties or the Fethullah Golden Movement.
The Turkish leadership is responsible for the failed coup attempt on 15 July 2016.
Some of the journalists accused threaten decades of imprisonment.
Foreign journalists are also not sure about the Turkish authorities: Only in early September was the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast arrested.
Last but not least, the cases of imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had given rise to concern.
They came free and were able to return to Germany, but in Turkey they still run trials against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him so fresh and good-looking: Florian David Fitz.
There you have to look twice: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht" produced by the NDR is known for lively discussions at the "Schellfischposten" booth of the Hamburg port pub.
Moderator Ina Müller meets with her guests some beer, some wine or even higher percentage drinks to attract the mood and tongues.
Not a few promis also drink courage for the mandatory singing inserts.
On Friday another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz is known from films like "male hearts", "terror - Your verdict" or "The horniest day".
The Municher did not get the trip to the high north at all.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely snuffed on it, his eyes only two little slits.
The bed-selfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he only has a powerful cat.
Directed to his fans, he posted some insights - probably not very serious - that he has now gained: "rule one: does NOT go to Inas night.
Rule two: never drink the black sauce.
And spray.
And the round egg liqueur, which Ina sheds by half three, also let go.
Alcohol consumption is truly written on the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans posted a few tips to combat the afterwives.
They were provided with instant broths, fish breads or - probably the most targeted - headache tablets.
Others simply enjoyed themselves over the sight of the normally attractive cinemastar.
As Ina Müller has survived the night, so far it is not known.
Since she has moderated the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more experienced...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight with vandalism and deception
The entrance to the 36 km long railway cycle path in the Rotkäppchenland in Treysa presents itself difficult to find and decorate.
Recipes against grazing vandalism are sought, but solutions hardly stand out.
Scissors, cigarette tilts, garbage and welders, demolished waste buckets and now dismantled notice signs - this has been the case for longer since the entry with seating group to the bike path on the Haaße hill in Treysa.
For the exhibition object Bahnradweg in the Rotkappchenland a more than ungrateful sight.
The topic concerns members of the ADFC site group Schwalmstadt but also others for a long time, according to the city of Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem had already been addressed by the Council of Rades.
There is no solution so far.
The proposals ranged from the relocation of the seating group to the regular emptying of the waste containers and the cleaning of the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the hour - regardless of possible other activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic was also included in the local council.
Not only the garbage drives cyclists and residents - the seating group is a regular meeting point for celebration on weekends.
It's not only loud, it's also destroyed in the joints: plasters torn from the earth, garbage bins demolished, signs knelt, seat furniture lubricated.
Volunteers had already cleaned up more frequently, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
The actions were, however, only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
They are annoyed that the rest area on the bike path in Treysa is the meeting point for suspension.
"The focus is clearly on the Haaße hill along the entire cycle path," confirmed the Radkehrsvoorte, who is now also taking care of the new cycling site in Ziegenhain, which is being opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive."
Another idea was a video surveillance on the hill: "Maybe this puts the threshold much higher to get to the common good.
However, this would presuppose that a police raid will come soon.
Basically, Wüstenhagen wishes to see a development of the Haasse-Hügel.
He needed to be made more attractive.
The frequency of the cycle path so far could be very satisfactory.
Tourism marketing is still expandable.
Our bike path is very high-quality compared to others in Germany," says the ADFC members.
As an extremely critical danger point, ADFC member Susanne Klippert estimates the situation in the Ascheröder Straße in Treysa.
There's no turning-off on the ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
In the case of regular traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between both sides of the traffic flow," she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but for older people and especially for children.
Music-Contest at Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the concert was a success, creative and in cooperation.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the Hiltrup district offensive, in the "Music Contest for Big and Young, Young and Experienced Musicians".
A "contest with eyelashes in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family gathering of coffee and cakes from the honorary staff of the cultural station.
Seven formations began, from the one-man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-standing albachtener living in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltruper star colours", three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Swiss.
This contest, according to Mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We haven't seen that in other parts of the city.
What were the lyrics associated with?
At the places the Lake Hiltruper and the market avenue were particularly often mentioned.
Rolf Hemig, in his song "Kö von Hiltrup", curated the Allee.
The cultural station was also honoured.
Again and again it was about experiencing one another in these places, especially Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short rest periods with short interviews with the performers or clues to their work.
It was learned from Humberg that he had actually studied chemistry, but now he also taught guitar.
From sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann Franke knew that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a big event of BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has placed all over on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
There was something special for the jury's favorites - so that others can listen to their songs too.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record an entire CD with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Hemig with his Hiltrup-Schlag, who particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very nice appearance" with ten children and two educators of guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone, the children also appeared at the final - and even sounded "right good" without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, access to the melody and recognition.
The jury belonged to Gisbert Keller of the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß of the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers of the Wirtschaftsverbund and Jan Kaven, chairman of the Stadtteiloffensive.
The District offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year existence.
She considered the event to be a full success.
Everyone was "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural train station.
The word game: "decrypto" in game test
The players form two teams opposite each other.
For each side there is a screen, in it four cards with keywords that you can only decipher - the old trick with the red slide - once you put it in.
This ensures that the opposite side cannot read anything by mistake.
For example, on the cards you can read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2nd window.
3rd cube.
4th Feast".
These are the terms that must be encrypted from now on.
For it is not the terms here that should be guessed, but codes.
Alternating one player per team is the cipher.
He gets a code card that says "3.4.2".
In "Decrypto" should be guessed not the terms behind the secret film, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "dice", "fest" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team as far as possible; because this wins the game if it succeeds twice in breaking the code.
The cipher thus notes and reads out loud: "Throwing" for the cubes, "Lose" as a contrast to Fest; here, of course, something like "Party" would be possible and "Prag" because he took care of the school and knew the window crash there.
This is how it goes round for round, team for team.
Although you don't know the terms of the opposite side - but they can get better connected with any hint the cipher gives there.
It's possible to be mysterious, but it's not to be flipped, so the conversions should be, otherwise you'll make it unnecessary for your team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic thing about "decrypto" is the rule book.
The participants probably have to study it quite long and detailed until they can finally play.
The explanation video under decrypto.info on the web makes it easier.
But anyone who has started will be fascinated by how much the feeling is in this invisible game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as the predecessor and genre prime "codenames", which also an agent theme on a game of less words, but it is much better to play in small groups.
And to whom it is only about guessing and not about victory points, it can easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows Hitler's greeting and harasss guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection Kulmbach on the night from Saturday to Sunday twice.
He first showed Hitler's greeting in the Upper City of a passing police stripe, and later he also fell into a pub in the Upper City when he conjured up other guests.
After he was clearly alcoholized by the police, he was forced to spend the night at the Kulmbach Police Inspectorate in the prison cell.
In a sobering state, he must then also take criminal responsibility for the use of identifiers of unconstitutional organizations.
Works Pressig was home to the Schubloks
The station in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers hit buffer, they heard it all in Pressig," remembers Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
No one's gonna turn that up.
That's why the brakes squeaked and the carriages clattered.
That was pure railroad.
Statements that stand for Dinkel's home Presig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so influenced by the railroad.
Here was the starting point of the steep ramp to the north, which after an increase of about 220 metres in height has its tipping point in Steinbach am Wald.
In order to cope with this, earlier train and drawer blocks were needed, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway station with 21 locomotive sheds, apprenticeship workshop, track and railway mastery.
"Heartpiece was the turntable, which after a conversion in 1899 had a diameter of 18 meters," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historians and 47 years of professional railway.
Pressig, which was placed under Bamberg in 1968, also operated Loks for the Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonnenberg and Kronach - Nordhalben districts.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight Elloks were stationed in Pressig at that time.
The electrification of the 1939 track already minimized the need for train and drawer blocks.
From 1977 they were only used for freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10 000 weighings were placed each month.
In 1982 parts of the plant were cut off, in 1991 the rest.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that we have not seen a better use of the site, even in freight transport".
At Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg Railways Directorate celebrated a pompous railway station festival in Pressig for the anniversary of "50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld".
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
Not long after that.
On 1 June 1991 the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Pressig yard was history.
"The rangers and shovel loaders did the most difficult work in the train," Dinkel recalls.
Every misbehavior would have had fatal consequences.
Why the Presig-Rotenkirchen station has led to the conversion of the Hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current pictures are available here in the intrudedPlus article.
Kerber with lead at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing as before Julia Görges.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the Frenchman Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the world rankings third is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or the Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina, when the Russian on number 13 resigned.
The Schwäbin gets to do with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
A special exhibition in Mittelehrenbach was opened at the weekend during the series "Kunst und Genuss".
With great ease registered organizers and visitors watched the ideal weather, when the property Dahlmann-Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach, opened the Special Vernissage "Windspiel-Performance".
It takes place under the roof of the Tourism Association "Round ums Walberla" as part of the series "Art and Enjoyment".
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
A large appeal to visitors showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to open the Vernissage.
He's been there since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as principal organizer and artist.
A bit surprising but Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he put his job in proven, young hands with a good future perspective.
Both have already played an active role in the selection of artists and have contributed to Flyer.
This year, again, there is a 70-cent special letter brand designed by Kunst & Genuss, available at every art station.
There, this year's poster "Betzn Austanzen", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high acceptance of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won for the musical setting.
When walking through the spacious garden, it becomes clear to the visitor that the title "Windspiel-Performance" formally challenges and ultimately expresses the artistic imagination.
It is made of metal or ceramic, often with colour accents.
Already at the entrance of the property the visitor awaits on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" by artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, colorfully lit, playful with 20 wind wheels, 24 horseshoes and 24 alu tubes provided as a sound piece.
With the sun flashing through the bushwork in the background, the object seems fairy-tale and invites you to stay.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who prefers three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts, moving in the wind.
On half the track, Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "The Wind of the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colorful imaginations made of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme of "Windspiel-Performance" is presented by the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Albachten: singers celebrate 50th birthday festive
1968 - that was the time of protest and student movement.
And at that time the Albachtens aired their disbelief.
At least five of them.
They did not want to partout because after the dissolution of the church choir "Cecilia" there should be no more singing life in the district.
It has now become a legend: At a bank in the tin bush they raised the MGV 68 albachten from the baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "house of meeting".
"It will be full today," said Chairman Jürgen Holstige, and he should keep right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachten singer.
They had revived the foundation festival, especially for the anniversary.
For years it was tradition, then there was a break.
On time for the 50th anniversary, the festival was back.
An elegant ball it was for festive clothes had been asked before.
The guests did not sit in rows of seats as usual in the "house of meeting", but comfortably at tables.
In the meantime, movement was called for: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln drew the controls and asked for the dance floor.
It is an honor that the singers of the MGV made the voice of the 68 Albachten.
In line with the occasion, happy songs were called.
Almost already set: "Like a day, as beautiful as today".
In line with the exquisite grape juice that many had before them, there was the "Rüdesheimer Wein".
In alluding to another cool drink, Humulus lupulus sounded, which is the Latin term for "hops".
Again sovereign was the choir lead by Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in the tin bush at that time.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," Holstige said, "he has such an easy way, it's a master performance he performs." By the way, this time not only men presented themselves as singers.
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest whose repertoire includes, in particular, Evergreens from the 20's to the 60's.
Finally, there was still poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had sat at the desk until three o'clock in the morning to create his own rhythm.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented soothing poetry.
There was a big tombola too.
The proceeds are intended to finance the children of the Albatros Youth Centre a visit to the Allwetterzoo.

Volleyball: 3rd League Women: USC II wins high-class Derby against BW Aasee
The climber's marching.
Three games, three victories - the USC Münster reserve under the patronage of Axel Büring is quite right in league three.
No trace of shyness or fracking sauces that the independents do their thing.
And that at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aasee really good.
"That was not crystal clear, but we have already left an impression," says the somewhat satisfied trainer.
BWA-Coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
On the contrary, we are not dissatisfied.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday celebration by Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game stopped.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical deception.
In the third sentence, the guests had a set ball.
"If they bring it to the goal, such a game can already tilt," knows Büring from years of experience.
Finally, with its routine powers, the USC made clear everything and brought the full exploitation to its destination.
"Everyone knows who's in such a derby on the other side.
That's not gonna break our necks.
I have seen a really good volleyball at times," Annacker did not hate the 0:3 and immediately moved on to the agenda.
Wherever the journey goes for the independents, after just three days of playing seems not to be foreseeable.
"It's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The 3rd League has an incredibly good level.
With Regionalliga Volleyball, this is not nearly comparable." In the fourth league, they don't want to look down anyway.
If the West is not polluted in the next few weeks, they must look up.
A first balance sheet can only be drawn after ten, eleven games.
On Saturday it's going to Emlichheim.
Aasee will enter Essen on 14 October.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "dream ship" Heide Keller became the star.
Now she's openly talking about that series could have had a share of her marriage-out with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as head hostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the "dream ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 01st, 2018 she went off board forever.
The series that made her the star could be responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"That could have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled around the world alone with a suitcase, and many of my admired colleagues came to my attention," says Keller in conversation with the "Picture on Sunday".
First of all, she had always been only "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "dream ship".
Because now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"Whether he liked it so well, I don't know."
She thinks it is possible that her husband at the time might have been quite jealous, but "how many men also shuddered Hans' discussions about problems and feelings".
Keller had always tried for Hans von Borsody "to be the only one right and he wanted to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I have changed my mind", as she explains.
She always felt like "not being good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman, who I was never really, even though I appeared on stage sometimes naughty and brave.
I wanted our love to be forever".
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes, "although I was afraid it might go wrong a second time."
On the day before the official wedding, I sat in the closet crying and wanted to cancel everything.
==References====External links==
Why never did it with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller introduced his love "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not everyday.
I've gone way too naive to love."
The nightfolder who regularly explores the nightlife of the city in the NZZ resort of Zurich has ventured to attend the ZFF opening party this time.
Our falter is not a moth, but it's a little bit shy.
And the glimmer in which a green carpet is dipped on the six-sleeved square fades it over a fee.
But it's a film festival, there's more or less famous people want to be sunny in the spotlight.
So on this late Thursday evening he drowned over the square to facilitate himself briefly in the "Aquaclean-WC-Oasis".
The public toilet facilities sponsored by a large plumbing company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival, are known as: The needy institutions in the parterre of a new pavilion make a lot of effort to pour out a luxurious ambience.
This evening, however, it stinks in the men's oasis for some reason to heaven.
So get out here, across on the other street side: Loaded guests who have just had the best level in the cinema next to the opening film "Green Book" celebrate the festival with a party in the three-storey department store every year.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: The works shown come from all over the globe.
What you don't have to think of in an article about this festival to avoid falling into sleigh advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The foal binds itself to a belt around the feelers who have put a good fairy in him, and two bully doorsteppers actually wave him generously in.
Inside, the invited ones push themselves, dance far after midnight to live music or let themselves be pretended by DJ rhythms to which they are yelling at each other, and rinse down with cuppi exquisite hippies.
In the delicacies shop in the souterrain, oysters are waiting for sloping mouths, next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, a chocolate well is sprinkled.
And the hammer is: All the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been removed for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without major losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The boy studies the sign at the escalator: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If the two separate instructions were to be, he would be in the dress code.
But it's more of a conditional structure, and it certainly saved lives.
In the household goods department on the upper floor, the wing tipped a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", suitable for the festival award.
The price of the best drink does not force this mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents himself.
And George Clooney, who's been in the market for years, is not here that evening either.
There, however, a face is drawn between local prominence, cash table and kitchen items, known to the observer: Peter Farrelly, director of the opening film.
It's not likely that his main actor will be far.
And really: Likewise Viggo Mortensen, with almost sixty almost like a choir boy, walks through the crowd.
He's not squandered, he's not gifted, he's tossed at the most.
Especially for this restraint, often misunderstood as a disguise, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dance
Coach and ex-football star Diego Maradona is delighted with the victory of his team.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have experienced well in his new home Mexico.
After a 2:0 win of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to Cumbia rhythms, as can be seen in a video published on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member Maradona dances in the yellow jersey, fired by the players.
The Mexican second-ligist had defeated the Leones Negros on Saturday with 2:0.
After the game Maradona called in a TV camera "Always with my boys, always".
The 57-year-old has been training the Mexican Club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Allied League 1: ASV Send to last-minute care "destroyed to the ground"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the Handball-Verbandligist ASV Send, could hardly believe it: "So such a bitter defeat". His guards were "damaged to the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - Pleite - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday night at LIT Germania 2.
They had - as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst - not played poorly over long phases, the transmitters.
Only the initial phase "we've totally slept," the ASV coach got upset.
Soon the houselors led with 8:1, also the early period that Bieletzki had taken, did not at first fruit.
"Then suddenly a jerk passed through the team," Bieletzki gathered the second quarter of an hour.
During the rest period, there were only two goals.
Most of all the broadcasts best, Marius Hintze, met in the phase one by one other time.
After the change, it became even better from the visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes David Ernst made it to 15:15, and then the season changer almost went through.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still apparently calming three hits (29:26).
And then?
Interprets the impartials in the event.
Bieletzki usually guards against looking for guilt in others.
But: The 120-second time penalty, which Steffen Mühlhoff collected, "was a joke".
LIT had well laughed and met up to the end four times - during the decimated ASV even failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, back and forth against seven men well stood and repeatedly thrown on the empty gate.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now it must be a damn victory," said Bieletzki.
ASV-Torre: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlödl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kumper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).

Bavaria: Missing woman for 30 years - Police are digging for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old from Naila County Court, the police are looking for the remains of the woman.
On Saturday, workers dug up a street at Marxgrün.
For this purpose, the street and several strata were decommissioned, as the police and prosecutors shared.
According to new insights, the missing persons may not have been buried far away from their home.
The woman has disappeared since November 4, 1986.
The investigators did not rule out a crime at that time either.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court, together with the Public Prosecutor's Office, has been working intensively on the case again.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monument Protection Authority, the investigators met with a ground radar on an uprising under the street near Marxgrün.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials restricted the place to a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows what dangers are lurking on the web.

In addition, security updates should be installed quickly, for example for Windows, and it is not harmful to equip computers with anti-virus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of Tesla's electric car manufacturer, has escaped his threat as head of the billion-dollar company.
He and the U.S. stock exchange supervisor SEC extrajudicially contributed a dispute over misleading Twitter news, in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla pay $20 million per year, and Musk gives up the Chair for three years, a position comparable to that of the German Supervisory Board.
He may remain opposed to this.
In comparison, which must be confirmed by or by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted misconduct.
The SEC had sued the world-famous manager in front of the US Federal Court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also heads space company SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-writing electric car pioneer, which is now valued at the stock exchange with more than 50 billion dollars.
Musk is not aware of any guilt
Musk explained that he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed in the complaint.
He has always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7th, Musk had written his more than 22 million Twitter followers, he might take the company off the stock exchange and pay 420 dollars per share, which is secured.
Tesla would have been rated as 72 billion dollars in total.
Later Musk rowed back: Tesla remained on the stock exchange.
After the agreement, Tesla must now find an outside chairman, appoint two independent members of the board, and also set up a committee that monitors Musk's communication.

Eden Hazard took care of the Chelsea leadership in the 25th minutes with his sixth season hit.
After that, the Klopp team missed compensation several times.
National player Antonio Rüdiger explained after a solo by Liverpool’s goal hunter Mohamed Salah on the line (31.).
Shortly before the end, Sturridge solved the Reds with a sleigh in the angle.
Recordmaster Manchester United has been slipping deeper into the crisis since 1989 after the worst start of the season.
The team of the controversial coach José Mourinho lost at West Ham United earns 1:3 (0:2) and stays in the middle field with ten points after seven days of playing.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow before the Champions League match against Valencia FC on Tuesday.
The former Leverkusen gatekeeper, Bernd Leno, came to his first Premier League operation after an injury from Petr Cech.
Prior to the Champions League game at 1899 Hoffenheim on Tuesday, Manchester City won goals of Raheem Sterling (29th) and Sergio Aguero (65th) 2:0 against Brighton&Howe Albion.
Leroy Sané prepared the 1:0, and Ilkay Gündogan did not join the new top rider.
"Let's Dance" judge Joachim Llambi and Mrs Ilona separated
Joachim Llambi must have separated from his wife Ilona.
The dance expert has become known by the RTL show "Let's Dance".
After 13 years of marriage Joachim Llambi (54) and his wife Ilona (45) are now separated.
The "Picture on Sunday" (Bezhalinhalt) reports under appeal to Llambis Lawyer about the separation of the well-known moderator and dance expert.
"Our clients have separated from each other in agreement and friendship," said lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser, according to "BamS".
The most important is now the well-being of their two daughters.
According to the report, the couple met in a pizzeria in 2003 and married two years later.

Surveys: 46 percent did not want Merkel as a chancellor by 2021
After the last few weeks' querels, the GroKo collected several polls.
The SPD falls back in a survey behind the AfD - Angela Merkel is critically viewed.
Berlin - The AfD has taken over the SPD in the Emnid Sunday trend for the picture nationwide for the first time on Sunday.
In the weekly poll of the opinion research institute, the AfD adds a counter to 17 percent, the SPD drops one point compared to the previous week and lands at 16 percent.
Also CDU and CSU lose one counter and only reach 27 percent.
This is the lowest value for the Union on Sundays.
The greens reach 15 percent, the left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
If the Bundestag elections were held on Sunday, the government parties SPD, CDU and CSU would receive only 43 percent of the votes together, according to Emnid.
Thus, the great coalition at all major research institutes - with the exception of Allensbach - has lost the majority on Sunday's question.
The government parties consistently reach 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allebach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 Bundestag election they received 53.4 percent.
With the other parties the band is also large: the AfD, in several polls the second strongest party, comes to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens reach votes from 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is an average of 10 percent, FDP is 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down depending on the voting share.
But also the detention for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has fallen significantly since the Bundestag elections in 2017.
At present, only 48 percent of citizens find that Merkel is the right person in the office of chancellor, as the Emnid survey on behalf of the BamS resulted.
According to the survey, only each second (50 percent) currently wishes that the large coalition holds in three years until the next regular federal election, 41 percent for a new election.
In a further survey published on Saturday, there had also been significant loss of popularity for Merkel.
The Germans also consider that Merkel should run again for the CDU Presidency in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are against 44 percent.
Thus, 64 per cent of the Union's followers want a candidate, 35 per cent not.
Hanging out at Aldi: Reduced price for happiness
Is Aldi going to Tinder 2.0?
Who says in times of tinder there are no more romantic connoisseurs' stories - he should talk about powdered meat at Aldi once.
Munich - In times of digital "Fastfood dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket, as an inventive place for great love, exudes almost anachronistic romance.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced powdered meat, boxer short snacks at the wohl table or the favorite pudding is in doubt still a better story for the later grandchildren than just a hip to the right.
The Tinder app is called to be less a contact, but rather a slippery stock exchange.
We risked the test: How do women react, not talking about the hot breezy for long in the first news?
Here's the amazing result.
It's right-wing Hollywood Lovestory potential then when love happiness precedes a lost-eye-and-recovered plot.
If the guy also reports with his adored person under the email address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de, then it already sounds like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
Thus, the author of this ad in an unknown Aldi file would like to wish that she would also find her traffic jam, with which she briefly entertained herself about the "30 percent reduced organic pout meat".
She certainly earned her Happy End à la Hollywood for the faith in the magic of analogue learning.
Picture deck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgeri School has participated in the action "Decel against Polio - 500 lids for a life without child paralysis".
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polioviruses.
The disease described in German as child paralysis leads from paralysis to death.
In Germany, Polio is considered extinct, but there are still three countries in the world where the disease occurs.
The cause of poliomyelitis, the polioviruses, can so far only be controlled by vaccinations, as a press release says.
Football: Reus and Zorc demand peace for God
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB sports director Michael Zorc and Captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion on the form and fitness of Mario Götze.
"We should stop thinking about Mario.
That's not good for the boy.
And that's not good for us," said the God-friended giant after the 4:2 win in Leverkusen at the TV station Sky.
Zorc had already stressed before the game.
For him personally, this is not a simple situation.
Soccer: Eberl: No rush in contractual discussions with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (dpa) - Manager Max Eberl from Borussia Mönchengladbach's football club sees no hurry with a possible extension of contract with coach Dieter Hecking.
We haven't even talked about a treaty yet.
There is no fixed date when we do that.
"But it will certainly give us the moment we sit down and talk," Eberl said on Sunday evening at the TV station Sky.
Football: District League: Researchers Performance of the VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrheine makes courage
There were moments in this still young season, then Alois Fetsch went hard into court with his own.
Workskarg gave himself to coach VfL Wolbeck, the football district attorney, to retreat (innerly) to think about the lack of performance on the green.
All history.
In the meantime, it's running around the Brandhoveweg again.
Taufrischer Beleg is the 1:1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine, in the past season only hauchdünn was scrapped by the ascent.
Yeah, I'm very happy with the appearance.
"We made the rooms tight and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and sought out every single person for the game to simply say "thank you" for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
After 26 minutes, the coach had to make a system conversion.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him Luca Rehberg - it went out of the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1, where Niklas Thewes waited in front of balls.
Wolbeck had significantly more game shares in the first section.
And chances.
But before his departure (17th), the changed Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the tour.
Almost this would have happened when the SCA in minute 41 immediately two times in person by Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbrämer hit dangerously in front of the Wolbecker box - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his profession.
After the break, the VfL took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters failed barely.
Schroer also arrived too late after 58 minutes with a Thewes entry.
With the integration of Miles Geske, the left side of the fetsch again missed a fresh cell cure.
When Altenrheine's Chris Naberbräumer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was an indirect free kick for the placelors 18 meters in front of the guest house.
The foal itself started and demonstrated its danger to standards.
Westhues" thing with the right loop hit the bottom left from the point of view of the shooter - 1:0 (71.).
20 minutes to be damned long.
And then this: VfL captain Florian Quabeck accidentally flew the leather in the penalty room to hand in the 80th minute.
Arbitrator Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
Bange minutes had to survive Wolbeck in the final phase, before the gesture had twelve meters in the 87th minute, but the victory hit on the shower.
Might have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th century), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th century Geske) - Thewes

Starting position: Four points after five days of playing - that couldn't be enough Trainer Adi Hütter.
Against Hannover 96, Eintracht Frankfurt finally wanted to win the first home win.

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
During the landing, an accident occurred on the airfield.
The four occupants were slightly injured.
Around 14 o'clock there was a drama at the airport in Kottingbrunn on Sunday.
When a helicopter was landed, turbulence occurred, as confirmed by the police against oe24.
The heli was caught by a windblower, powerful on the ground, and came to rest on the side.
Immediately, police, rescue and fire services were agreed upon.
The forces came to the scene with a large bid.
The ÖAMTC-notarzthubschrauber was also called to be careful.
Insets only slightly injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There's only one damage to things.
The four occupants were only slightly injured and were able to return home on their own.
The precise circumstances of the accident have not yet been clarified and the subject of the investigations.
According to Feuerwehrspracher Franz Resperger, there was a small fire of origin, but it could be quickly erased again.
Report of the Allbright Foundation: Women remain rare in corporate boards
This meant that only 8 percent of the executives on the 30th of September were female, as stated in the report "The Power of Monoculture", which is officially presented by the Allbright Foundation on this Monday and was presented to the German press agency in advance.
"The companies will have to set up differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass by them," said foundation manager Wiebke Ankersen.
In the United States, Great Britain or Sweden, purely male-occupied leadership teams - with few exceptions - are no longer possible.
The backlog makes the German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.
It's a different corporate culture.
In addition, the small increase in the share of women among German stock exchanges was only due to positive impulses in the companies of the index of medium-sized values (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the directors are female.
In the previous year, however, the value remained at 3.8 percent.
The women's share of the 30 Dax companies - past years of pioneer workers - has stagnated.
Last time 26 women worked in the boards.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit more consistent women in their own interest next year," said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signalled that they would continue to take no self-commitment to increase the proportion of "zero percent" so far.
Another picture is available from the supervisory boards: on 1 September, the proportion of women was 30.5 per cent - 45 women more and 68 men less than one year ago.
"The annual recruitment of women for the Boards would have reached 40 percent in 2023," says the report.

"Autopapst" and business professor Ferdinand Dudenöffer have worked with this question.
His study shows: The differences are massive.
Ferrari made 69,000 euros with each car sold in the first half of the year - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only amounts to around 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley put up a lot in every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are good in the race with prices from an average of 33,000 to 38,000 Euros per car and around 3,000 Euros before interest and taxes EBIT.

Torch train for the opening of the 60th abtswinder Weinfest
With a torch train, the Tourist Association opened its wine festival in Abtswind.
For the 60th time, the club will host the wine festivals, which will continue every Saturday in October in the large festival tent on Rehweiler Straße.
At the start of the anniversary, the people responsible went through the place to the festival place among the sounds of the Spielmannszug from Wiesenbronn.
The chairman of the Tourist Society, Wolfgang Starz, Mayor Jürgen Schulz and Princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests in the already packed festival. "For 60 years, this is a great achievement for a small village with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of that," Starz thanked all the helpers.
Later, the wine princess Lisa II symbolically started off with the guests from the stage.
"Good thing so many have found the way back to us after Abtswind." Later, "The Troglaures" provided atmosphere.
On Sunday, on which the Abbswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the club had set the prices of drinks as 60 years ago on the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon.
A party evening at the 60th wine festival takes place on Friday, October 5, in the guest's house, before it goes into the second round one day later in the festival tent.
In Bonn: emergency car power in taxi
An emergency car stands heavily damaged next to a road.
A 27-year-old passenger has been fatally injured in the collision of the operating vehicle with a taxi.
When emergency doctors are called, they should help - best save even human lives.
Such a rescue trip took a fatal end for a 26-year-old in Bonn.
Bonn - In the collision of an emergency car with a taxi, a 26-year-old pedestrian was killed in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their drivers were severely injured, as the police reported.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency car had crossed a red light on Saturday afternoon with blue light and Martinshorn.
He then met on a crossroads with the taxi that drove at Green.
After the collision, the doctor's car hurled an ampelmast and a tree.
He captured the passants who died at the scene of the accident.
Driver of the emergency car and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency car were badly injured in their vehicles and had to be freed from force.
The injured 29-year-old emergency doctor could free himself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another dubbed emergency doctor tried this - but without success.
The three severely injured were brought into hospitals.
The police will determine who is responsible for the accident in close coordination with the Bonn Public Prosecutor's Office.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we tirelessly
After the blamable Out in the Ligacup Manchester United is now also losing in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United, Manu is subject to 1:3. The way of defeat should still give way to talk.
The scene in the 74th minute, in which the recovered Marko Arnautovic for West Ham shot the 3:1; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford had supposedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
As they suspected an outside at the pass of Mark Nobel, all Manchester defense players stood still, and Arnautovic let all the time in the world to shoot the ball at the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative peak of an insufficient performance already over long distances.
At present, it is quite different from United's city rival Manchester City.
The citizens trained by Mourinho's major competitor Pep Guardiola came to an approximate 2:0 win against Brighton & Hove Albion.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke for the home team for the first time the outsider's defense lock.
After a good hour and a double pass, Sergio Agüero took care to secure the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also to jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool No More Table Leader
Three days after the 1-2 defeat in Ligacup, Xherdan Shaqiri fought with Liverpool in the Premier League a 1:1 against Chelsea.
As with the Cup-Aus, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in London.
The hit of the 27-year-old in the 25th minute remained until the final phase of the game.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, missed the balance after 70 minutes.
Better it was Daniel Sturridge in the 89th minute with his sleigh.
So after the Reds started with a flawless record in the week, Chelsea was not to beat for the second time.
First, the Londoners eliminated Jürgen Klopp's team in the Cup, and the Blues Liverpool fell from the top of the table by the remis in the league.
Like City, the two London City Clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) celebrated 2:0 win.
The fans of the Gunners, during which Granit Xhaka played through, had to wait until the 81st minute for a success message against the surprise team from Hertfordshire County.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defenseman Craig Cathcart bended a herein by Alex Iwobi unhappyly into his own gate, just two minutes later, Mesut Özil with his third match for the season.
Arsenal, due to the fifth consecutive win, passed Watford and is now in position directly behind the big rival Tottenham in rank 5. A strong impression continues to leave uplifting Wolverhampton under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unbeated at 2:0 against Southampton in the league for the fifth consecutive time and took 8th place.
VW nuclear brand missing: Paris car salon in sign of diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years in exchange for the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no topic and yet ubiquitous: The diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofitting should not be allowed off by German car companies even at the Paris meeting.
From the next week, at the 2018 Automobile Salon, together with the competition from all over the world in the French capital, they will show their novelties.
Diesel doesn't really matter much anymore.
The possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, however, should still be an important topic at least behind the brilliant scenes of the booths.
A big name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is present with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are here and have their first pure electric models: the e-tron of Ingolstadter is due to come to the market at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgart 2019.
But both were already officially presented.
The iNext of BMW is due to start in 2021.
The new 3s are at the centre of Paris.
A total of more than 250 exhibitors will be present from 4 to 14 October this year.
In addition to car companies, motorbike manufacturers as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are also present in their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in exchange for the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, well over a million visitors came.
During the severe earthquakes and the following tsunami, at least 380 people have been killed on Sulawesi Island.
A dozen more are missing.
There are also more than 500 injured people.
The island had been shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had the strength 5,9, the second the strength 7,4.
Communication and transport links are damaged, there was enormous damage to the material.
After the quake, the Tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds of people gathered at the beach for a feast.
It is feared that the number of victims is still clearly on the increase.
So far, the figures come from only Palu.
However, there are also numerous other municipalities - along the west coast of Sulawesi.
Some 150 Bikers Celebrate Worship in Werdohl
Herne Motorbike Pastor Frank Schröder (right) celebrated the final divine service for motorcyclists in the Friedenskirche in Eveking on Sunday with a team of helpers.
Werdohl - The place in front of the Friedenskirche in Eveking belonged to motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final divine service for bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the soul-care interests of PS-strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorbike god service (MoGo) at the house Nordhjelle will always take place on the last Sunday of a month.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Friedenskirche in Eveking.
There were about 150 bikers gathered on Sunday to do anything but ordinary worship.
From 10 a.m., the Bolidens were lined up in front of the entrance door of the church.
First, the biker’s early cooker was on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cakes or even with a deft curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were present.
The sermon was held during the biker god service by pastor Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical undertone.
"Although the bikers prefer the blues rock, Valerie Lill prefers poetically quiet tones," said Father Frank Schröder.
This too was certainly a novel in the history of the motorbike god service yesterday.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates a big celebration: The milk comes after the apple
Borisch was also active on the actual day of action.
She supplied her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niederg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated his astonishing viewers step by step the process from ripe apple to apple juice.
Then and when did Hartmann-Niemerg leave the children the field and let them fill the apples in the big funnels.
With a little muscle strength, apples became a finely crushed mass.
Not many of the children could yet imagine how to get a tasty drink out of it.
But they could also look at this important work on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and encased in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the little piece of apple for layer over each other.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step was no longer so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice ran gradually into a large vessel.
However, the grower farmer had already completed specialities.
So he opened his "Schatzkiste" and presented the older visitors to the latest feather whites.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was thus great.
In a cosy atmosphere, the parents came to the conversation, while the children could not only follow the process of the apple press, but also discover the built-up hop castle for themselves.
Active of the Füchtorfer Comradeship of former soldiers also took part in the festival and invited some stations to play short games.
Also in the coming year, the home club will offer an action day.
Then, however, Gregor Krützkamp stressed, the home house in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the issue: it will then be round the milk.
1:4 vs. Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season lead: "Bezise situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Federal League defeat, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hanover 96 around him and encouraged them.
However, there was a lot of positive things to be seen before at 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out there as a team," said 96 football pro Pirmin Schwegler and pushed after: "This is disappointing, of course, because you always take a lot of action."
The further sigloses of Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) met for connection, stand with two counters at the very bottom and are in their present constitution a descent candidate.
On the other hand, Frankfurt celebrated the first home win of the season, led by Ante Rebic.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) scored 46,300 spectators the goals for the DFB Cup winner, who, after the successful general test for the Europe League game against Lazio Rome with seven points in the middle field of the table.
Croatia's vice world champion Rebic was involved in his launch debut almost in every dangerous offensive action of the Hessen and never to get hold of Hanover's defense.
The storms long struck after the World Cup showed with their speed and perseverance why it is so valuable to enter.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, which was loaned by the FC Liverpool, stood for the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurters, which began in swing.
Lucas Torró (17th) was the first man to risk a head ball that had been falsified on the main network.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96 defense around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term Kevin Wimmer (backs).
The leadership for the landlords almost fell inevitably and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic raised the ball after a defensive corner in the penalty room, Haller extended by head in front of the gate, where Ndicka only needed to keep his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga match for the French second-ligist AJ Auxerre, who came in the summer.
And Frankfurt left before the break.
This time Haller adapted to his storm partner Rebic, who thought himself through skillfully and left no chance for 96-torth Michael Esser.
In the mid-term, Hanover Coach Breitenreiter responded to the weak conception of his Elf and brought two new offensive forces to Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
Although the Lower Saxony played a bit bolder towards the front, burning ideas remained until shortly before the end, when the connecting hit.
The Hessens were much more efficient.
After a short hour, Rebic started a solo and then placed across De Guzmán, who had to push the ball into the empty gate.
The rest was only too much fun for the Frankfurters, and Jovic met a minute before the end.
The Morlaix square becomes the party mile
Würselen Despite cool temperatures, good atmosphere prevailed at the October Festival in the city center.
The Mayor of Munich Dieter Reiter managed to open the 185 million public.
Municher Wies'n in the last week with two strikes.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christian Celebrate Holy-Kreuz-Fest
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross festival on 14 September or on Sunday thereafter.
The service takes place in the city church, then a procession to the Holy Cross church with the finale.
The Church of the Holy Cross houses the shot Christ, who comes from the 30-year-old war and is supposed to have shot on that legend after a Swedish soldier.
Then blood was spilled from the gunshot wound.
From this a great pilgrimage developed to the shot Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Church of the Holy Cross.
This is not yet finished, only the altar room is standing, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Father Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
In spite of the importance for the Geisinger parish, worship was badly visited.
After the divine service, the procession took place for the Church of the Holy Cross and ended with the conclusion of the ecclesial part of the Crusade.
For many years the Catholic Church choir has then invited to the secular part of the festival into the Catholic parish.
The choir members supplied the visitors with hearty dishes as well as a large selection of cakes and the weather adapted, agriturismo ice cream.
In the afternoon the parish church offered guided tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed visitors about the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone works and windows on behalf of the parish, as well as the construction measures that will be carried out until next year.
After the scaffolding has been in place for some time, the damage could be determined more precisely and the individual calls could be prepared more specifically.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage that already exists a few years ago has become larger, but more has been found, which has only been possible through the inaccuracy by means of scaffolding.
The pedigree work is completed, the natural stone work is due to begin before winter and one hopes to complete half of these works this year.
Inauguration: New residence in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
Donau-Iller's life aid opens up a new residential home for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
The fact that "a very special house" will now be handed over to his destination in the Münsterblickstrasse - that all present agreed on the inauguration date.
Finally, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the residence of the life support Donau-Iller for some time have depended on the special architecture of the new building.
Wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and accessible access for all areas, architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former U.S. Army officer building was put to the test for the residents with mobile phone cap: "The house had come into the years and no longer in the equipment," said Bader looking back.
In 2016, the excavators pressed to tear off the house.
The new building should be as friendly and bright as possible, so that the inhabitants can feel comfortable in it, says the architect.
Donau-Iller's life aid opens new residential home
About 4.6 million euros invested life support in the new building.
The Free State taxed 2.4 million euros, the Schwaben district 450000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work remained within the planned framework - both in time and in financial terms.
He was also thanked by the managing director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz.
The space between a barrier-free and simultaneously fireproof construction has not always been easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many requirements, allowing the inhabitants to experience freedom to move even without foreign help.
In a similar vein, the head of the social administration of the district of Schwaben, Gertrud Kreutmayer, said: "The house is oriented to the special needs of its inhabitants who need help to be mobile".
The apartment and functionality were well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And on: "The plot in this situation is a real happiness because it is no longer possible to purchase in the present situation".
In total, the new residence in the Münsterblickstraße offers almost 1500 square meters of space for 30 people with disabilities, which are divided into three living groups.
Pride is the life-help manager Heinz to the eleven full-time workers, all of whom are employed according to tariffs.
Germany: Schwesig lamented Differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of unity, the Deputy SPD-Chairman Manuela Schwesig appealed to all compatriots not to find himself with the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity.
We must not be satisfied with these differences," said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the "Day Mirror on Sunday".
The goal had to remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans worked on average longer than the people in West Germany, but get 15 percent less wages.
"I can't explain that to anyone almost 30 years after the German unit," said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this dirty dog end the Korea conflict?
The one-year-old pungsan dog is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In the effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pjongyang has made Moon Jae a gift to South Korean President In two North Korean Pungsan dogs.
As Moon's office announced on Sunday, the two dogs about one year old reached their destination already on Thursday.
They then passed along the border town of Panmunjom along with three kilograms of dog feed to facilitate the "inhabitation".
The dogs with the thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the National Cultural Heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The friendship offer had announced to the North at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un in mid-September in Pjöngyang.
Both countries also agreed to join in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to apply together for the Olympic Games in 2032.
In the course of the mutual approach, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket drives.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
For the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months in this commemorative year, numerous new books have been published, which usually answer this question in retrospect of the past hundred years.
It is quite different from Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and general director of the Austrian State Archives, in the magnificent "Picturerbuch" Austria, which will appear on 1 October.
New week, new chance for the government
Back to the work in hand - this is the unofficial motto for today's Great Coalition working week.
Almost an interview, hardly a speech, in which the chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU did not last mantraly invoke the "return to expertise".
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and otherwise employed citizens in this country to the legitimate question, which is actually the difference between work and work, but it is.
If the Federal Government is now ready to once again devote itself to its mission - the government - then it should not be held back with debates on terms.
Whether Union and SPD can do something together after the provocations and blows of the last few weeks will probably show Monday.
In the evening, the Heads of Government meet at the Coalition Committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to call this round regularly to defuse conflicts early; a lesson from all the dispute.
First of all, however, conflict-affecting issues are again on the agenda with the Diesel retrofits and the German Immigration Act.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to let the car companies with exchange premiums shine away, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation to refit older diesel.
While a rapprochement has taken place in the diesel crisis over the weekend, the Union and the SPD are still far apart in the planned labour force immigration law.
The SPD calls for a stay perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or train.
The Union is strictly opposed to the "change of trace" from the asylum system in the labour market.
So there will be another dispute among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not the same and the same has merged with the Groko, but three partners with some very different social images and priorities.
Fighting is good.
Without dispute, a society that is so diverse and sometimes contradictory does not advance.
In order to be constructive, however, disputes must not be rebuilt for party-tactical reasons on the question of being or not being.
It's still about politics, not theater.
Union and SPD are to argue - but always have the reality of people's lives in mind.
What is feasible and useful to many?
With this key question, both the diesel and the switch question can be pragmatically clarified - and thus gained confidence.
That is why the people's parties must fight now.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister of the Visit
Does the Minister of Labour violate the applicable law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Really day and night" had worked their legislates on social security reform, reported an exuberant social minister during the presentation two weeks ago.
At list-pilz-mandator Daniela Holzinger, Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) says surprise - she now brings the matter to Parliament via request.
She assumed that "the Minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm about the deployment of her team and not to declare any violations of current service law against current cameras".
Nevertheless, they now have questions to be able to "exempt" Har things from every suspicion.
Police are tearing a street in search of women's bodies
Marxgrün - Lange didn't want to talk to the police about it.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben is dug.
The line is closed in the area of Marxgreen until Monday.
The investigators had previously used an archeology dog.
The dog specifically trained for the smell of old human bones, together with its leader in multiple use, could finally limit the relevant spot to a few meters.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Supreme Bavarian Monument Protection Authority in the area of the said street piece.
For more than a year now, the Public Prosecutor's Office and the Criminal Police Court have been handling the case of a missing person.
Again and again a cycle path was blocked at Marxgrün and investigated with sonar devices, because the investigators suspect that in the course of the new construction of the Staatsstraße 30 years ago Heike's body could have been torn apart.
Colour powder and eggs: Claws in Barcelona before Catalonia's anniversary
On Monday, the disputed Independence referendum in Catalonia will be held for the first time.
But before it comes to Krawallen.
The separatists did not forget the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan Independence referendum of 1 October 2017, there have been clashes between separatists and the police in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked, among other things, by the independence supporters with color powder when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the National Police and Civil Guard.
Some 3,000 officials from police units Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honor their colleagues with a rally, who last year were employed in the polls as an illegal referendum.
In an attempt to prevent citizens from paying votes, violence had also taken place at that time.
The Catalan police had formed a chain to separate the demonstrations of the separatists and the central security forces, reported Spanish media.
However, some of the approximately 6,000 separatists would then have forcefully tried to break through the police chain, and the officials would have thrown color bags and eggs, among other things.
Six people had been arrested, 24 more had been badly injured, called upon the authorities.
On Monday, for the first time, the independence referendum is held.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to split the prosperous region of Spain, the Central Government in Madrid had placed Catalonia under compulsory administration in autumn 2017.
Carles Puigdemont, then regional president, fled to exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also settled abroad.
Several ministers of the regional government at the time and other activists of the Separatist movement remain in U-Haft.
In December, the new elections had been held in the region.
After the new Catalan government entered office in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But also the new regional president Quim Torra insists on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Soccer: Oberliga Westfalen: Collected indifference: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separates torlos
Red-white Ahlen continues on the spot.
Even with FC Gütersloh it was only one 0:0-decided.
The final light and the third, they appeared before 438 spectators in the Heidewald Stadium as a rascal.
The first half was quite manageable by the entertainment factor.
Those who would rather get a beer or a roast sausage could do so unconcerned.
There was no danger of missing a Torchance, because there was virtually none.
First shot after half an hour
Güterslohs Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) goal shot of the entire game in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle only true - had the Ahlenes, when Cihan Yilmaz FCG-Torwart Frederic Westergerling forced the Achlener to parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the border.
Even more harmless were the hosts.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Stürmer Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, for which Sinan Aygün came.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the growing boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel from 18 meters aimed just above the housing and after an hour the Gütersloher appeared offensive for the first time.
After a ballooning of Matthew Wieckowicz it went fast.
The quickly presented account about Sinan Aygün "kronte" Nick Flock (62.) with a butt-blazing shot into the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
They also played with a Hoofball by Wieckowicz (66th) after a corner ball by the ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA-Interim Trainer Angelo Daut responded, initially brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60.) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70.).
It did - nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to its own initiative, the Ahleners failed to achieve.
It was only in the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but they also brought nothing.
Angelo Daut tried to spread out the positive: "I like that we played to zero." But unfortunately, the zero also stood at the front.
"We weren't as dangerous this time as we were against wooden coils, and even though our opponent didn't want to play with us," said RW Ahlen's Interim Trainer.
Offensive "everything was such a bit" against a team that "just wanted to defend.
At least I didn't feel like we could get a countertor," Daut said.
As a spectator, however, one did not feel that his team could shoot a gate.
The idea was too poor for that.
Reckenfelder Erntedankmarkt: Fortunately, there are enough Kreimers
The joy of Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder table edition office, for which these donations are intended.
The honoraries assure: "These donations remain also in Reckenfeld".
At the opening the sky was shining blue, the place was still a little empty, but that should change in the course of the day.
Because, "Here it is so nice to meet you, that's why we're here today," said one visitor.
The organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a decent price humor.
For the Brockmann couple, who were supposed to be balanced against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in for a short time.
Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough Kreimers.
And the "replacement" was not allowed to be entertained by musically the increasing number of visitors.
This happened so well that a few folk songs were sung at later hours.
"Just great," Marcel Kreimer rejoiced.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to make the opening date this time in his schedule.
He enjoys the many activities with their stands, including mostly clubs.
"Actually, there should not be anything like a tablet at all," he nevertheless thanked himself for the action of the men's choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all those who were in use at the stands and also included the other festivals held in September and the "Clean Up" action.
Our garden town gives itself a colorful paint - here is something.
Then Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück took the Maikranz with the help of the fire brigade and took it to the winter quarter.
Many stalls have been worked for the physical well-being.
Everything from sweet to hearty was to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only lived in Reckenfeld for one year, became creative on his decupier saw.
Furnace work, beer lid with reckenfelder motifs and some more he had in offer.
A speciality was offered by three Reckenfelder Bemker: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Büschschschlütter.
The latter has a specialty.
Honey cake in the glass, of course with honey from my own production.
There the little Elsa had to access again and again, so tasted the cake.
It is the happiness that allowed the visitors to stay for a long time until the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Lubrications with local political message: No successful advertising for skating facilities
In Lengerich, unknowns have cast in a hardly conducive way for the construction of a skate plant.
In several places there are appropriate lubrications, says Jürgen Kohne from the city administration upon request of the WN.
In at least one case, criminal prosecution has been filed with the police for damage to property.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich" were spelled out on signs at the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the Halle, reports that after the professional election fair on September 19th, an appropriate letter had already been discovered on the billboard at the staircase to the Gempt-Bistro.
Since the short message had apparently been left "only" with an Eding at that time, it could have been removed without problems.
"A few days later, however, this was there again, this time sprayed up," says Rottmann.
He assumes that the corresponding billboard must be replaced.
A special note is given in this particular case by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the board.
If the skate plant is built, its realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
Jörg Hesselmann explains the urban department of school, sport and culture without naming.
However, it is possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical with those companies that are on the damaged board.
For years local politics and administration have been dealing with the issue of skating facilities.
After the old one was demolished at the LWL clinic, after some time the search for an alternative location began.
Finally, the Council expressed itself in favour of the fire-fighting parking lot.
However, this idea was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a construction at this point.
At the end of June, a turnaround followed.
The members of the Main and Financial Committee now voted unanimously for the area of Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of affairs that the administration is at the moment in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word then has the City Council.
He assumed a decision this year that a positive vote could be held in 2019.
Air traffic control tighter
Frankfurt/Hamburg The German air traffic controllers do not see any signs of improvement in the coming year after the European air traffic chaos in the summer.
"This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm will come," said Matthias Maas, head of the air traffic control union, the German press agency in front of the air traffic summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
One important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures was the long-known staff shortage in European air traffic control, for which there is no quick solution.
" Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots takes four to five years," said the trade unionist.
Europe-wide, the market for ready-trained pilots is empty.
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone for the supervision of the upper German airspace, about a hundred people were missing.
Maas again criticised the fact that several air transport trade unions were not invited to the summit.
On Friday in Hanseatic City, representatives of the Federal Republic of Germany, the countries, air traffic control, airlines and airports meet to address the causes of delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work compression and overtime, this will not work without us," said the head of the GdF, who has many members in the German air traffic control system.
Maas once again made the targets of the EU Commission responsible for the Lotsen massacres.
Traffic forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 were far too low.
The resulting cost formulas and staff savings in national air navigation services are now fully applicable to the operation.
Maas appealed to Federal Minister for Transport Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for regulations that "don't cut the air anymore" the air services.
At present, EU regulations would be voted by 2024 and further tightening would be to be feared.
The EU was constantly under pressure from airlines.
"Ryanair Chief Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown in recent years," Maas said.
He hopes that the high delay costs of airlines will lead to a rethink.
The GdF will only help to improve the situation if the German Air Traffic Management (DFS) offers a "consistent training and future pact", Maas said.
The previously announced admission of 120 pilots per year over the next five years is very rich in order to compensate for the age-related declines.
The necessary staffing is not yet connected.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board agrees with Group Conversion
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board have voted unanimously for the plans to restructure the Group.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp Interim Manager Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Board at the Sunday meeting, the operating group is to be divided into two independent companies.
Both companies should have their headquarters in Essen and be listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional reduction in staff beyond the already known cuts in the administration.
After two resignations, the control body on the capital side counts only eight heads.
This is the case with ten employees.
However, the final decision is expected to be a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is to include, among other things, the 50 per cent share from the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business is to be bundled with lifts and deliveries.
Barcelona: Violence at Demos by police officers and Catalan independence supporters.
Two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish policemen and Catalan independence advocates in Barcelona have led to violent conflicts with many victims.
According to the City Administration, about 3000 police from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, and some 6,000 independent supporters were also protesting.
The Catalan police have tried with a large bid to keep the two protests away from each other.
However, according to officials, independence advocates repeatedly tried to break the security barrier.
They would have attacked the officers with paint and throw shots.
There were rankings, according to data, between the participants of the various protests.
According to rescue personnel, 24 people were injured.
The police told me there were six arrests.
Better salaries and Members' valuation
With their demonstration, the police had wanted to commend colleagues who had taken action almost a year ago against the independence referendum in Catalonia, which was banned by the Spanish central government.
At the same time, they demanded better wages.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel that it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn much more than they do.
The demonstrators felt that it was a provocation for the Spanish police to demonstrate in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez of the news agency AFP.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they threatened us a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name with Daniel, rejected the accusation.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades who did only their duty last year: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we do it in Barcelona because that is a great European city and there is more echo here.
He and his colleagues had, however, "not come to provoke," the policeman assured.
Panne allowed access to personal data of the British Minister
A vulnerability to a mobile app has caused the personal data of ministers and members of the Conservative British Tory Party to be temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknowns after the breakdown became known one day before the Tory party day in Birmingham.
Two people glued to B217
On Sunday morning, the police in Hanover reported a heavy traffic accident on the Bundesstraße 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the exit of Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people died driving their cars against a tree.
The car is currently in flames.

Football: Juve coach praises for top game: Ronaldos best game
This evening, the Portuguese Star Stormer played "the best game together with the half hour of Valencia," praised Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3:1 (1:1) victory of the record champion against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensive star bought was also without its own goal the decisive man in the important game against the pursuer.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and does well," said Allegri.
Even if we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first gate - and from the moment we grew.
Thanks to the three goal pieces by Ronaldo, Juve turned the game after the early retirement through the hits of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and hung the worst chaser for the time being.
The goal hunter, taken by Real Madrid, initially posted Mario Mandzukic, the former Bundesliga professional, who led with a double pack (26/49.).
And Ronaldo also made the preliminary work on the hit by defense chief Leonardo Bonucci (76th), who had to push in just before the goal line.
"He gives many templates," the coach praised.
But Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team of the record goalkeeper.
"We need to be even better at serving him," the coach asked.
Best Juve gate protector is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three in the account.
With Ronaldo's purchase for more than 100 million euros, Juventus' overpower seems to be even more oppressive.
Seven wins in seven games is the flawless series in series A. At 21 points the master of the past seven years already has six counter lead on Naples.
The tabular range trained by former Bayer-Coach Carlo Ancelotti was not without chance against Turin.
But at the latest after the place reference of the already confused Mario Rui (58.), the top part was decided.
The Portuguese had to climb against Paulo Dybala with yellow red from the square after too hard.
"We played well against a good Naples," said the Turin Coach.
Addressed was also allowed to feel Emre Can.
The German national player has prevailed at Juve.
The professional came from the FC Liverpool was used by all seven league parties.
The middle field actor also played in the Champions League party against Valencia, which Allegri said with the "half hour": Ronaldo had flown from the square on the 2nd win of the Turiners and was locked for home play against Young Boys Bern on Tuesday.
Kanye West changes his name
At the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" on the weekend, Rapper Kanye West paid attention with a particularly scrupulous appearance.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump ensured in a mineral water costume for bristles and question marks by the viewers.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a change in name on time for the release of his new album.
From now on, you can only call him "Ye," says the musician.
"The being formerly known as Kanye West," he tweeted in line with the late singer Prince when he gave his artist name.
The pseudonym, however, is not news.
Already the tenth album appeared under that name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist had explained that "Ye" has a religious significance for him.
"I think "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means "you", says the rapper.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
Done!
Hotmar's coach Averhage made no noise out of his disappointment.
This was a weak game by us today.
The opponent was easier to handle, we've put him as well as never before in trouble." Accordingly, the list of Hotmar's shots is thin.
Grades by two Torch Chances in 90 minutes, so can rarely make games positive.
Football clubs A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two possibilities in the first pass, the first but used Maik Krause from a sharp angle to an early lead (7.).
In the 43rd minute Steffen could have increased Uphus, but after great preliminary work by Krause he changed freely.
The hosts had only a double possibility when Moritz Höne failed to Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher and also found his master in the post-war Jan Blome in the post-war band Keeper.
After the break the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good opportunities.
But Uphus (49.), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69.) all awarded.
A trade meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved with his hand on the goal line and saw Red - also Niklas Eilmann could not use for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide pushed the ball over the line was the game decided (81).
"We had criticised ourselves before, which was different today from the last few weeks," said the conclusion of Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.
Tore: 0:1 Krause (7.), 0:2 Berheide (81.).
Red Card: Kortenjann (75./Hoetmar).
Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectake football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject Concordia with 3:4
"I don't know what to think of it," he ranked by words.
"We don't have access to them." With that he probably meant the wing pliers with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but probably also all the other green whites that came up with a collective offensive urge.
He could still laugh: "A dirty victory," he still said, waving frantically and drawing from then His players, on the other hand, the relief was to note that they had pulled three points out of the affair.
Well noted, after a duel of two teams, one of which, namely Albachten, plays to the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for the class salary.
GWA-trainer Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes that lay behind him, with understandably mixed feelings.
"This was by far our best seasonal performance," he says.
"As we return after the 0:2, as we oppose one of the top teams of the league over the entire season, that was already really phenomenal".
The more bitter it is that you have to go home with empty hands.
Top-Tor-jäger Lars Zymner brought the hosts with his 12th season hit in the lead (24.).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
The 2:0 he placed above the left side patternable for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew this, but you can't take such a player out completely.
"That was already crazy what he did," Lewandowski acknowledged the quality of the opponent.
Shortly before the change of sides, his own Elf succeeded in balancing: McGill's free shot from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia Gatekeeper Hingerohe into the long Toreck (45.).
After the change of sides it was McGill again who achieved the balance (59.).
Then it went back and forth.
It was a cracky, action-loaded game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann (69).
Despite the excess, Albersloh no longer managed to re-count the last Concordia meeting (80.) again.
We must now focus our full attention on Wednesday.
"The game against sheepskins, that's what we need to win now," Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonne (87. Bareksai).
Tore: 1:0 Zymner (24.), 2:0 Fröhning (39.), 2:1 McGill (45.), 2:2 McGill (59.), 3:2 Nübel (64.), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80.).
Yellow-Rot: Atalan (74th/Albachten).
Football: TSV Straßberg fights point against Primus
There was no winner in the Landesliga-Duell between the TSV Straßberg and the FV Biberach.

Media: Total Bureau of Dynamo Dresden resigned
According to media reports, the entire Bureau of Football Zweibligist Dynamo Dresden has resigned.
Several media in the evening called for a joint letter from the Saxony Board.
A confirmation of the association was initially not available.
The reason for the withdrawal should be internal power struggles with the former Bundesligist.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of Pomp
I'm glad he's gone.
There are only a few state guests whose departure in Germany provides such great relief as that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Three days the Turkish President was visiting Berlin and Cologne, and many had meant that he should not have been invited at all.
Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers about 80 meetings by the middle of next year.
France's President Emmanuel Macron has thus signaled that he wants to pick up the tolerance price personally in Tutzing.
The term of office was too short for Christian Wulff: he was not a federal president in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was visiting there.
As he proudly said, "All the Presidents and Chancellors of the Federal Republic were with us." The fact that prominent people appeared again and again at the Academy in the castle of Tutzing was also a topic during the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October Songmaker Konstantin Wecker participates in a conference on spiritual experience in philosophical perspective, on 29 September the writer Frido Mann is at a conference about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
In the meantime, France's President Emmanuel Macron has also said that he wants to personally accept the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which in another category also receives television moderator Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The 80 or so meetings by mid 2019 will be held.
"The pension is not safe!" is a conference title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - this is how the Academy describes the "risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And to a meeting on Syria: "Barbarei without limit".
Armed Deals, Destruction, Torture, Death - the War repudiates every humane idea".
From structural racism in society, across the sheer gap between rich and poor, to the radical change of work through digitization, the spectrum ranges.
Akademie-Director Hahn was convinced: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions or at least for partial solutions".
At a meeting of 200.
Karl Marx's birthday shortly awaits a more visitor in the direction of capitalism-criticism, the others rather a tendency "from the outside of the left to the middle".
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical State Church," said study director Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral."
Music cabaret: gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westphalian news
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christ's Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret girl, the Teubner brunted gender understanding, not only with humor and warmth of heart for the (feeled) woman and (feeled) man and what else there may be, but also with music.
The mini guitar used it and also mastered her violin.
Ben Süverkrüp was sitting on the wing.
On the one hand, the male sparring partner, who sometimes even reaches the end of the sentence, on the other hand, is a true pianist: So royal harmoniously accompanied Süverkrüp Teubner that some may have wished for a solo.
There was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, that is, as it fit for the red thread of the evening.
Then Teubner had put a paradox into play: the satisfaction with the man, if he has a partner, but he doesn't open the door.
A closed door without a partner on the other hand brings no benefit.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same thing: What would have emerged from Mozart's composition, would "the Nannerl" have opened the door without hope?
Thus, in improvisations, from Bach's "O Head Full of Blood and Wounds" to the "Suffer of Death", and Mozart g-Moll Symphony into a playful dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Flowers were handed over to Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the club, the Chansonette.
But the chairman of Heidemarie Markenbeck did not accept any additional thanks.
She had the idea of enjoying a duo in Wolbeck as well as appearances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

Handball: Women’s Landesliga: Ahlener SG keeps against TV Waddenscheid hardly the white vest
The Ahalen women had problems with third-party player Caroline Stallmann, who alone marked ten hits.
"In fact, I was well pleased with the defense, only one player has made too many goals.
We didn't get them," said ASG-Coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more annoyed by the many missed opportunities.
The concentration in the final analysis left his team missing this time.
The ASG therefore ran almost to the end of a rear position, lay at the break of 11:12 and later at 15:18 (45.) behind.
Only in the end did the wider bank of the host women make a decisive impression.
In addition, Aydogdu set back room Merle Klement on the left side, which then made "extreme clever the decisive gates" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd League Women: Top performance of the BSV East Beaver at the VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyballers of the BSV Ostbevern have again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd League West.
At the VC Allbau 2nd-gauge racer, the blue-whites won with 3:1.
"That was a big step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz play in the top third of the league.
We have been working on this now," said Coach Dominik Münch, looking forward to his team's almost impeccable performance with the failed leader of the table.
The first pass almost dominated the guests as desired.
He went over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 at 25:15 to the vice- champ of the previous year.
Food was accepted in the double lock, but it didn't come into play.
We've been busy.
Our opponent has turned up with high risk, but also produced several tickets.
In the second sentence, the BSV already led at 12:8. "Essen has converted the assumption to triple bars.
We couldn't hold the pressure.
Eating sucked, and we got a bit drunk," Münch continued.
At 18:17 the volleyballers from the Ruhr area had their noses in front of them for the first time.
At 19:24 Ostbeverr resisted four more balls, but the fifth attempt found its goal.
"The game was now a better class," the practice manager found at the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silke contributed significantly to the BSV turning the sheet into 25:21 in the third section from 14:16.
Münch: "There we played consistently and quietly".
About 7:3 and 15:13 the Blue-Whites brought four passages with 25:22 to their side.
Vera Horstmann was elected the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier had also caught a great day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish municipality: Mosque opening as missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticised the way the great Ditib Mosque was inaugurated in Cologne by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"In German-Turkish relations, the Mosque opening in Cologne has left a cluster of shards, which can only be put together effortlessly," said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and the German sides would have missed the opportunity for a joint, reconciled appearance.
"Besides Germany's top politicians, Erdogan has used the date to underline the affiliation of Muslims to Germany," lamented Sofuoglu.
The widespread exclusion of the German public had "enhanced many reservations".
Heimatverein Nottuln: offer has already established
After the long summer break, folktreff time is finally back.
On October 18th (Thursday) at 7.30 p.m., the Heimatverein Nottuln will already host its fifth notable folk meeting in the fireplace room of the Old Amtmannei.
Almost on the day it's been a year since we had a folk hit for the first time.
Meanwhile, this event has become an integral part of the musical calendar in Nottuln," says Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I wouldn't have thought that our folk hits would flash so fast in Nottuln eta.
No matter whether stormy Friederike in January or heat wave in July, the fireplace room of Amtmannei was always fully occupied.
"The program at the next folk meeting is like always a colorful mix of German folk, hiking and sailor songs, folksongs, Evergreens and old hits," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who repeatedly invites friends of musicians to Nottuln.
Klaus Spelmeyer promised his first birthday with his accordion.
He was a member of "Gaitling", a group from the district of Steinfurt, who played music with flat German lyrics for many years.
Now he's on his way with an Irish-people band.
The makers of the folk meet remember the last event in summer, when Christoph Schulz of Folkstreff Emsdetten enthusiastically sent the listeners home with an earworm with his international version of the song "Frösche at night".
"We expect many happy guests to spend a happy and humorous evening again," says the invitation of the home club.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to get involved actively is invited to participate.
Since the desired seats are always occupied quickly, it is advisable to be there in time.
The folk strike starts at 7.30 p.m., but admission is already at 7 p.m.

From pure fruit to ecology
With a gala in the Dr. Stammberger Hall, the 125-year-old existence of the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, with a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, the last founding impulsions for the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach were set, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a big anniversary in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle on Saturday evening.
In 1893 he was raised from Baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa as the "Kulmbach City and Land District Fruit Building Society".
Also the purpose of the fruit-building association was different from today's work - it was actually purely fruit-making, no one thought about flowers and horticulture at that time.
"At that time, in the era of Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," said Kreisheimatpfleger Günter Dippold in his festive talk.
Fruit trees should line up long-distance roads, so-called industrial gardens were built in schools.
The Obstanbau is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which include almost 7,000 members.
But the spectrum is far from exhausted.
Natural horticulture, organic plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play an equally important role as the conveyance of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Maulwurfe" showed how diverse the tasks of a garden construction association are.
"Youth work is particularly necessary in the digital age," said CEO Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed the importance of natural experiences for life.
The chestnut collection was a big thing for us children, I doubt that with Smartphone & Co. you can gain similar joy.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where to stand, the county council decides," added Landrat Söllner and highlighted the special importance of the gardening associations for the villages.
The circular association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district left no doubt as to this, also circuit director and expert counsellor Friedhelm Haun.
He led the many visitors with an image talk through the long history of the circle association and reported, among other things, the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past, everything came out of the garden, for the winter it was ingested.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the garden has turned into a ornamental and residential garden.
" Nature has existed, it has already been there before us and we have to be oriented to it," argued the expert for fruit and nut trees.
This is why it encourages gardening associations not to leave behind so that our home stays beautiful and worth living.
It is also important to welcome the new citizens in our associations, the president of the Bavarian Landesverband, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We have to stop the ecstatic decline in insects, which we owe to our children and grandchildren," concluded Günter Reif of the successful ceremony, which was solemnly framed by the towers of the Thurnau Music Society.

Priority on Naphta talks: Canada's Foreign Minister places UN speech
Mexico's government wants clarity in matters of Naphta: they put an ultimatum on both sides of the market for an agreement.
Canada's Foreign Minister now gives the Trade Agreement absolute priority - and postpones her speech to the United Nations.
Due to the pressure of time when the North American Free Trade Agreement (Naphta) was relaunched with the USA and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of today's Saturday, the minister will not speak until Monday before the United Nations Assembly, her spokesman Adam Austen announced.
Meanwhile, they concentrated on the renegotiation of Naphta.
The Mexican Minister of Economic Affairs Ildefonso Guajardo had declared on Friday that the negotiation leaders of Canada and the United States would have 48 hours to reach some if Canada actually wanted to accede to the trade agreement already reached between its country and the United States.
The United States and Mexico agreed in August on a new version of the Nafta Regional Free Trade Agreement.
US President Donald Trump suggested that Canada could be excluded from Naphta in the future.
The talks about a new edition have been going on for over a year.
By Sunday evening (local time) they are now to be concluded, Trump's government wants to present the agreement to the US Senate before 1 October.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico's designated President Andres Manuel López Obrador had announced on Friday to seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against Presidential Candidates Bolsonaro
The Brazilian presidential candidate, Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a mass attack, left the hospital.
The extreme right-wing ex-military wanted to fly to Rio de Janeiro after a report by the newspaper O Globo.
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will perform public appearances in the South American country in the last week before the presidential elections.
The politician had been attacked on open road during an election campaign in South Brazil at the beginning of September.
Meanwhile, in several Brazilian cities thousands of people went on the streets to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "The Not"), women's associations in particular called for protests against the ex-military.
The associations against Bolsonaros also made racist and woman-disgusting statements mobile.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital of Brazil, the protests mixed with a rally of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He replaced ex-President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to twelve years in prison for corruption and therefore is not allowed to run.
Presidential elections in Brazil will take place on 7 October.
As the former mayor of the millions city of São Paulo, Haddad was in polls far behind Bolsonaro's extreme right-wing candidate.
Although the "Trump of Brazil" has been involved in politics for a long time, recently it is presented as an anti-system candidate.
If no candidate reaches the absolute majority in the first round, there is an election on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not succeed in this - no matter who he is against.
Bolsonaro is well known for his defiance of homosexuals and blacks and for his glorification of the military dictatorship (1964-85).
Again and again he shocks with verbal derailments.
Another time he said that the supporters of the Left Workers' Party should be shot.

After long illness: Danish rock legend died
The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen told Larsen's website.
Larsen was surrounded by his wife and his six children on the deathbed.
The musician had been in treatment since the beginning of the year because of prostate cancer.
Larsen had become famous with the band Gasolin', which was tremendously successful in the 1970s in Scandinavia.
Their songs were influenced by international music sizes such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
In 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold about three million plates in Denmark.
His album "Midt om Nacht" from 1983 is the best-selling album in Denmark.
The Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen honoured Larsen on Sunday in a statement as "the street boy", who was "against everything but in all hearts".
The head of government also reminded us that the monarchy opponent Larsen had appeared in 2010 on the 70th birthday of the Danish queen Margrethe II.
Rocknacht at the shoe factory: Volume at the press air hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saws and light a concert evening with the power of a tiger." The band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" put such a conversion of the rock live music experience on Saturday night in the hall of the Burgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: Hardrock pure of three with another friend band.
After the sound check and shortly before the start of the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There is no trace of lamp fever.
After that, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in association with the "Mosquito" from Oelde Booking Agency - loudly appreciate the 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontmann and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to convince the start of the concert evening with latest, unknown pieces from their own spring and the upcoming CD.
In front of the stage, the band is danced to the vocal and compressive interaction.
Although "additional" calls are not to be overheard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leave the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
The fact that hard rock is not the same as hard rock shows guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich at the bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternative, sometimes classic rock of the 1970s remembering sounds.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" there is also a synthesizer for the guitar rock at "Here We Stand".
Not only the longing, straight ballad "Take Me Home" impresses with the switch from melodic passages to the guitar-resistant rock riffs of the multilayered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tonnish Noise has, however, gained a special level of awareness since its inception in 2005.
The band presents its hard rock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" has special stage experience with its performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 tour in China - is obvious and irresistible.
In conjunction with the band, singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also sets his own accents in the only enveloped song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
For the sound even more controlled than before, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers an overjoyed solo while running through the audience.
A certain amount of volume is of course part of such a hard rock concert: the "Mint Mosquito" rock night is the third concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" at about 98 decibels, according to the Mischpult team.
This is due, for example, to the pressure hammer level, but it is still clearly below the controls of the "wake-fesitval" that point to the "The Ignition" on their website.
However, the Ahlen audience does not need 120 decibels in diaper volume as usual in the annual metal flooring in the north of the Republic.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocky gangart have long convinced themselves with their sovereign, virtuoso game and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, took the bone saw and lit a concert evening with the power of a tiger," all three groups, of course in the sense of transmission, can say at the end.
And above all, enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A death in a sailing accident at Essen/Mülheim Airport
At Mülheim/Essen Airport there has been a fatal accident.
At a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen Airport, a sailplane crashed on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
Near Mülheim/Essen Airport, a fatal accident occurred on Sunday.
As reported by the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung", a sailplane was crashed at the fair car park at the airport.
The pilot had died.
As the "WAZ" continues, the student had been on board on his own - the pilot is supposed to be a resident.
The plane was already in the landing flight at the time of the accident.
The crash site is located just a short distance from a landline on the airport site.
But since this weekend a Oktoberfest is taking place.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is located at the city border of the two Ruhr district cities and directly at the foothills of the 52 motorway.
From the parking lot there is a park & ride offer at large events at the Essen fair or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump heavens Kim: "And then we fell in love"
The fact that the US President of North Korea's ruler Kim is quite well off despite nuclear crisis is no secret.
But now Trump has made a true love statement to his colleague.
She also has to do with Kim's "wonderful letters".
At the tender age of 72, the married U.S. president has become known as a new flame.
The tragic: It is a remote connection.
Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un in public on Saturday.
In front of supporters in the US state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-old spross of the ruling dynasty from Pjongyang, although in the struggle for North Korea's nuclear disarmament he proves to be quite tough.
"I was very hard, he too, and it was between us," said Trump.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim would have melted his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Her personal connection also bore political fruits: Trump referred to the stop of all nuclear and missile tests announced by Kim, even though critics behind it have seen little more than lip confessions.
That the affection for whether his martyred threat bearer "Rocket Man" - so Trump's nickname for Kim - should not be any memory, seemed to be quite aware of the US President.
In any case, he took the expected criticism of it at his appearance in a large sports hall in Wheeling City immediately in advance: "Donald Trump says they fell in love".
How terrible is that?
This is so unpresidual.
But if you don't take care of it, Trump explained it and then pointed his index finger to the crowd: "I've always told you it's so easy to be presidual".
But then, outside, 10,000 people wouldn't be pushing into this brightly filled arena, but we would have only been standing outside 200 people.
Octoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Best visited, atmospheric and upstairs spoiled by sun filled: Very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfestflair, Baesweiler's city centre has exhausted itself on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest did not only take place in the festivities at the fire brigade tower, but was extended to the city by the trade association on Sunday.
Refugees saved thanks to video from libyschem prison
Nigerian refugees have pointed out their disastrous conditions of detention in Libya using a mobile video, thus enabling their rescue.
The group had shot in their cell in the coastal city of Sawija in July under risk of life and distributed online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers", whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally deported to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we probably couldn't have returned to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who had recorded the video, the news agency AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya when attempting to cross the Mediterranean into Europe.
With the video, he risked his life in his own words.
One of his associates had almost been beaten to death by the guards, said Onyeka.
Generally, the detention conditions had been disastrous: "They all hit us with pipes and sticks."
They didn't give us anything to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary return of refugees stranded in Libya.
Some 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their homeland this year, said the IOM spokesman in the West African country Jorge Galindo.
The case of the now rescued Nigerians was not unusual in view of the poor conditions of detention in Libya.
But he hasn't heard of a help call per cell phone video yet.
International organisations have long criticized the conditions in Libyan refugee camps as unworthy of human beings.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on the way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the school place on Sunday afternoon to prepare her lessons for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
At 4:50 p.m., the teacher entered the building across the main entrance.
In the front house on the 1st floor she saw a man who immediately fled.
Only through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there via a ladder to the ground floor or the foreground.
The teacher informed the police who took up the investigation.
It is not yet possible to say whether things or money have been stolen.
Description: ca. 16 years old, black, very short hair, a little darker appearance, dark pants, dark T-shirt.

Germans were caught in their own car for days
A 75-year-old has had to stay in his car several days and nights in a middle-franken forest area after he has taken the car away from all the forest roads and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescue forces discovered the car on Saturday afternoon by chance not far from a pasture and freed the missing since Tuesday evening, the police announced on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was reported to be in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported as missing by his family after he had not returned on Tuesday from a ride with his off-road car over the local meadows and fields.
Despite intensive search, the man’s whereabouts had remained unclear for days.
Laschet urges the rule of law in Turkey
Köln NRW Prime Minister Armin Lashet (CDU) has in conversation with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in accordance with his own information on the rule of law in Turkey.
The relations between the two countries were currently "overshadowed", said Laschet on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This concerns, above all, the waves of arrest, the freedom of the press and religion.
He had therefore made it clear at Erdogan that if relations are to become normal in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, then the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this."
Lashet also referred to the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey, according to his own records.
He had expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan once again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been moved to a building of the German Federal Ministry of Defence at Cologne Airport in the short term.
Originally it had to take place at Wahn Castle - but the castle owners had rejected it out of political conviction against Erdogan.
After the conversation, Erdogan traveled on to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had canceled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said, "The Muslims who go into this mosque are also citizens of our country".
And we are also their contacts - and not the Turkish President.
Lack of confidence in the USA: North Korea is demanding disarmament
While US President Trump is not tired of highlighting the successes in the negotiations on North Korea's denukularization, the East Asian regime is showing the conditions more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for Washington's escape.
North Korea's foreign minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the US government of blocking negotiations for an atomic-weapon-free Korean peninsula with its ongoing sanctions.
"The latest stoppage is therefore that the US is building on coercive measures that are deadly to build trust," said Ri in New York.
An disarmament was unthinkable for North Korea under these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the USA, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there will be no way that we will first disarm ourselves," said the North Korean chief diplomat.
The fact that North Korea could force punishment on the knee was "a dream of people who don't know us".
To build confidence, however, his country stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed an atomic test plant, Ri highlighted.
However, there had been no "corresponding reactions" from the US side, the minister criticised.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and missile programme, the UN Security Council had decided three times last year sanctions against the internationally isolated country alone.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his foreign minister Mike Pompeo have been pressing the United Nations in recent days for strict enforcement of sanctions.
At the same time, the US government is working on a rapprochement.
In June Trump first met North Korea's ruler Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US President is aiming for a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is scheduled to revisit talks about the end of the North Korean nuclear weapons programme to Pjöngyang.
The HoT serves: New cuisine with donations from the municipality
The fact that they were actually in a youth meeting, the many visitors of the house of the open door HoT got nothing from it: White blankets and flower jewelry on the tables and a large buffet were waiting for the guests after the harvest thank-you service.
The young people of the HoT had enchanted the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The establishment was financed by donations from the municipality, for which young people wanted to thank themselves with the food.
It was not easy to start with the new facility, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT remembers.
We had our refrigerators filled with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then the bad surprise came the first day after the summer break: a power failure had put the huge, two-piece refrigerator out of operation, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start again from the beginning: although we have received a lot of support from friends and neighbors, the children and young people wanted to do it alone," said Westbuer.
And that's what everyone took.
The result could be seen that the guests were excited.
"Better can't cook, too," praised a visitor, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to use Quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It is really great what children and young people have put on their feet," emphasized pastor Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen, with card tricks and other pieces of art, was amazed.
Jürgen Sator leaves the board of directors NRW
Frustrated about criticism from their own ranks, the head of the Essener Table, Jörg Sartor, gave up his post in the national association.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essen table had introduced a stopover for foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as Vice President of the NRW Boards, said Sartor of the "World on Sunday".
I fell too many in my back.
The head of the NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, spoke about the dpa understanding of the decision of his long-standing deputy.
Sartor took the sharp criticism with him.
"I can follow his step - people have spoken out that didn't know exactly why the table was doing that."
Sartor is still active for the Essen table - "six days a week, there's nothing to change," said Weilerswiss.
Sartor again criticised colleagues from other panels in the "World on Sunday".
One should not follow the approach "without starving the people of the city".
It was the task of the state to ensure that people did not starve.
The Essenian did not participate in a conference of the tablets on Friday in Berlin.
"That's too much sweet dirt," he said.
There are all these social fuzzies that have criticized me so much at the time.

Thanks to an exceptional comeback, Borussia Dortmund is a new star from the top of the Bundesliga.
Lucien Favre's team had dealt with Bayer Leverkusen until the break of a 0:2 rebound, but in the 2nd half of the season it still won the 4:2 win.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65.) and Marco Reus (69.) compared to a doublet within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, provided with another doublet in the final phase (86./94.) for the crowning completion of the performance increase after the break.
The VfB Stuttgart also won the first victory.
Against the Werder Bremen, who had been decimated before the break because of a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic, the Stuttgarters had to fear in the meantime.
Borna Sosa and the unobtrusive Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler fabricated a curiose throw-away owner that helped the guests in the 68th minute to compensate.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a successful debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbachers who joined the Swiss Quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang gave a two-time lead, eventually played 2:2 and were still waiting for an outward victory in the city of VW since 2003.
For Wolfsburg's compensation to 1:1, Renato Steffen was responsible for his second federal ligator.
Yann Sommer was powerless at the 20 meter Aargauer flat, as was the second hit after an hour.

SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs gets married to his friend
Almost a year after the marriage came into force, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-standing friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday in Hamburg, the two of them gave themselves the jaword.
A registered life partnership had not been called into question for them, Kahrs had previously said the "picture" newspaper.
"If we get married, right." He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budgetary spokesperson of the SPD Bundestag faction and one of the speakers of the Seeheim Circle, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of the marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs had aroused an angry appearance on June 30, 2017.
So he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stammered" himself on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski motion," he referred to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, couples of the same sex can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the adoption right.
Garden day: 400 meter hedge cut
There was a lot of work in front of the members of the Bürgervereinung Kinderhaus and the Society for Leprakunde.
For around 400 meters of hedge around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the inhabitants, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
"We do this in order to reduce costs," said Walter Schröer, Chairman of the Citizen's Association.
And it's got a lot of stuff together, too.
Because of the hot summer we are late this time, but fortunately it is now just a shapecut.
Because already in spring you had already shaved the hedge once.
Breakfast is always followed by work and has a long tradition.
"Everybody should stay strong," said Walter Schröer.
World Cup in Rio: Hannes Aigner brings gold to the Canus lalom World Cup
The Augsburger Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the end of the Canuslalom World Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old made a perfect run on Sunday on the Olympia track.
Two years ago, he had missed the Olympics three hundredths of a year.
I was well prepared, had already enough rides here on the site and it was all right today," said the Olympic Third of London in 2012.
In the goal he threw away his paddle with joy and pulled both arms victoriously to the height - well knowing that it would be worth at least a medal.
After all, he had his number four.
But the six remaining starters couldn't top his fable time of 89.69 seconds.

The police inspection Gauting mentions the first attempt at burglary this fall to a family house.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - that's what burglars want to use again.
Thus, yesterday the police inspectorate Gauting mentioned the first attempt to break in this autumn.
The alarm system is due to the fact that it has remained at the one-family house on Königswieser Straße.
That was when the perpetrators laid hands on Friday just before 8 p.m.
The burglars knew that the residents were not at home.
The alarm system, however, seemed to surprise them so much that they took refuge without spoil.

Pleite bei Hertha: Retrieved from reality: Bavaria demanded against Ajax
The predicate is unbeatable: The defeat in Berlin will not be "fallen" by FC Bayern.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim conclusion for the term of Niko Kovac.
The first small power pit under the new Coach Niko Kovac is not to go up to a larger fall for the Munichers.
"A week ago, you had the impression, we're invincible.
Now we've got a bit of reality," Thomas Müller noted after the earned 0:2 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that this is really annoying and that's why we're giving gas to Tuesday.
For the first time since more than a year out, no goal of its own was shot, as at the same time of the previous season two compulsory games in series without victory, lost the table lead in the football league for the first time in Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is not as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record champion must still be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its race-intensive man-to-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful needle stitch over the outside have delivered two blue breaks within three days, as the last overwhelming Bavaria is to crack.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we don't like this and we'll do everything we can to make us succeed again," said Kovac.
Otherwise, however, with his losers in his birth town, he gently changed his mind and pushed his first defeat as a Munich coach only on the lack of opportunity again.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would still make the first interim conclusion to his term a positive outcome, otherwise the tone would probably get worse.
Thus Kovac did not take any exceptional measures before the second king-class appearance of this season after the 2:0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation for the second pre-run game against Ajax, which had also defeated AEK Athens at the start with 3:0.
"Now it caught us in two games, but we will also make our goals again," announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
Like after the lost finale against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke plain text.
The lawyer acted as a Mahner in the role.
"I don't think this is all bad, we have to work it out again because we don't make the many chances and make the mistakes behind," said the 23-year-old shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, the Bavaria even had five counters behind Dortmund, which now took the lead again with one point.
And so Kimmich, with a blindfold, appreciated at least positively that the public debate on the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has now ended.
"Yes, that's good," said the national player.
It's good for the league.
DFB boss in shot line: Ozil-Cusa: sharp attack by Erdogan on Grindel
With serious accusations, the Turkish President Erdogan denounces an exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the bandage line.
A new post is now to be created.
Berlin - On different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the highness of interpretation in the permanent course theme Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish President strongly criticized the German ex-world champion for the opening of the large Ditib Mosque in Cologne, the DFB Chief defended the association line.
On the early Sunday morning, Grindel, who was personally attacked by Özil, announced consequences from the Causa in the Mainzer ZDF "Sportstudio".
"There we have to draw very precise conclusions in the future - because we also have many players with migration backgrounds in U teams - that such a thing does not happen again," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migration background as another integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel once again stated that Erdogan did not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
In sharp words, he had denounced a racism against Ozeil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our born and raised Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they took photographs with me in England," Erdogan said on Saturday in the Domstadt.
To be honest, as their president, I could not digest the fact that our two young men, who had ascended to the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel pointed to Gundogan's statement that in contrast to Özil, he felt "reasonably treated by the DFB" by photos of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he would want to face players in the future.
That someone says, if I win, I'm German when I lose, I'm a migrant - that's not possible.
"I regret that he has such an impression," said Grindel.
We should have defended Mesut more, I always said that.
However, he does not see a basis for his return to the national team.
In addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, which has family roots in Cameroon, an additional integration officer is to be appointed as a follower.
"If a person has a clear impact on society and football without a migration background and says, "The issue is important, we need to take care of it", that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations on the ground where integration must work," said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup Aus and the Ozil affair, he wants to run again for office as DFB President next year.
"I do my job and try to make it as good as I can," said Grindel.
Yearly construction of three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - As reported by the police, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 and 13 o'clock.
First of all, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red light in the area of Lauter altitude.
She told the pensioner that he was driving her car.
However, there was no personal exchange since the 75-year-old could not find the lady in the parking lot anymore.
A short time later, the police received a telephone call about a car driver who had come off the road and driven against a crossroads.
Speaking of which, the man didn't want a police on the ground and then drove off.
After that, the Rödentaler drove home.
However, in his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, the pensioner has been running a construction vehicle while turning around.
Finally, the police were able to find and stop him.
His car showed significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a wretched impression and couldn't remember much more.
The damage is around 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Still almost 1000 Forces in Use.
About four weeks after the outbreak of the Moorbrands on a Federal Armed Forces site in Emsland, 980 workers are still employed in the fire extinguisher work.
The Bundeswehr announced this on Sunday.
Since the situation of a speaker is still stable, 70 volunteer helpers were recently withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of staff is planned, it says.
On the night of Sunday, an earthly fire had been discovered and erased.
Last week, the disaster had been lifted, which was proclaimed well a week earlier on September 21st, because it was feared that the flames would endanger forests and settlements adjacent to the wind and sparkle.

SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs gets married to his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde left the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Nearly one year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the politician married his long-standing friend in Hamburg.
They've been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Nearly one year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs has married his long-standing friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday in Hamburg, the two of them gave themselves the jaword.
A registered life partnership had not been called into question for them, Kahrs had previously said the "picture" newspaper.
If we get married, right?
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budgetary spokesperson of the SPD Bundestag faction and one of the speakers of the Seeheim Circle, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of the marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs had aroused an angry appearance on June 30, 2017.
So he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stammered" himself on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski motion," he referred to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, couples of the same sex can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the adoption right.
referendum in Macedonia on new state names started
In Macedonia, the expected referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Around 1.8 million voters are expected to decide whether their state should be called northern Macedonia in the future.
This is because of its northern province of the neighboring Greece.
For nearly three decades, Athens had blocked any approach from Skopje to the EU and NATO.
If the citizens agree with yes, they will also give the starting point for the Western integration of their country.

Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve members of stress situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can only be removed with explicit consent, emphasizes Swisstransplant.
(dpa) Switzerland will launch an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This should facilitate organ donation and relieve members in stress situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can be registered there.
Your wishes can then be found in the case of a Swiss transplant.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can continue to be removed - as in Germany - only with explicit consent, emphasizes Swiss transplantation.
It is assumed that 15 percent of the Swiss have a donor card, says Franz Immer, Director of the Swiss Transplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of cases will a map be found at the crucial moment with possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, the relatives do not know the desire of the deceased.
"You will then have to make a representative choice in the sense of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," says Always.
There is a similar system of registration in Great Britain.
In Germany there are considerations to store information on possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokesman of the Federal Health Education Centre, Marita Völker-Albert says.
"There is no register where people can enter their wishes - per or versus organ donation," she says.
Federal Minister for Health Jens Spahn has advocated a new regulation of organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would be considered an organ donor unless he or his family objected.
Among other things, the Catholic Church refuses to do so.
14-year-old student is world champion in headcount
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is world champion in headcount.
On the weekend in Wolfsburg, he fought against 39 co-contestants.
The Martina Flame-Jasper from the Science Museum Phaeno, the venue of the competition, announced on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The most recent participant in the World Cup was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the oldest of 74 years old retired from France, as major referee Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
For example, these tasks were 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
Since viewers were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, where participants against guests from the audience would turn on with calculators.
Wenzel greet from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air while calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in competition.
In total, 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Greetings were already there two years ago than then 14-year-old in Bielefeld.
With terms such as super brain, genius or wonderchild, organizers can start loudly.
"Practical calculations can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even stadia-oriented computing competitions.
Among the disciplines, for example, is the drawing of the square root from six-digit numbers.
When calculating versatility, the candidates get surprise tasks for which they need to find a solution quickly.
Here, too, the Germans had good opportunities, said the main referee.
Otherwise, Asians are often in the advantage of being more intensively trained in early childhood as well as other effective methods.

Vienna - The Federal Government plans a clear extension of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.

Polar cold air brings new snow to the mountains in the west
Ms. Holle shakes her beds for the first time in the West next week: Polare Kaltluft reaches Vorarlberg, Nordtirol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute of Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit decreases at the beginning of the week to 1,500 to 1,200 meters - in narrow valleys it can be snowed down to about 1,000 meters with strong intensity.
From Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern it is expected to be above 2,000 meters with 20 to 40 centimeters of fresh snow.
On higher roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjuch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions become wintery.
Farmers are allowed to start the annual knickpflege on Monday
Schleswig-Holsteins farmers are allowed to start annual knickcare on Monday.
The "green Wälle" that is unique in Germany has been shaping the landscape of the forest-poor state for some 200 years.
The tree and litter hedges up to five metres wide are "foresting" and for many animals and plants the last retreat rooms.
Knicks connect as corridors scattered habitats, about which the exchange of organisms can still work, as said by the manager of the Naturschutzbund Deutschland (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were created on the basis of an order by the Danish king Christian VI in 1766, who ruled Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field boundaries and livestock fences, they also supplied farmers with firewood and beams for their specialist houses.
From that time his name "Knick" also comes: By "cracking" the branches could develop the dense, intertwined boundaries.
Today, between the North and the Baltic Sea, some 45 000 kilometres of the hedges stretch and give the image of a wooded, diverse structured landscape.
According to NABU, they are now used as a spare habitat of about 7000 species.
In one kilometer Knick may live up to 1800 different species and breed up to 30 bird pairs.
However, its ecologically important function can only be fulfilled if it is maintained accordingly in winter.
Otherwise, he is accumulating to a light tree series, which, in addition to biodiversity, also loses the effect of wind protection, said Ludwichowski.
Knickpflege may only be operated outside the breeding period from October to March, according to the Ministry of Agriculture.
According to Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian, talk about on-site isolation
In an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND), the local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquake and the tsunami:
Were you on the spot during the tsunamis itself?
No, I was in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I immediately went back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because after a flight I had to drive for more than 20 hours, as the airport on Palu was closed at that time.
How is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast that were all completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have temporarily set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many have run on surrounding hills, on which they still endure for fear of another tsunami and earthquake and where they have no access to water and food.
Some stay in front of their houses, there are still aftershocks.
Because many food shops and also the gas stations are completely closed, people sometimes steal food and gasoline.
The public service has completely shut down, and the national government is helping.
Also, a prison was destroyed, the prisoners run some loose and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How are communication and information services running on the island?
At the moment we have mobile phone reception, but before that it didn't work and we only got information about the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people, of whom they do not know if they are alive and where they are staying, because people during the earthquake were not at home, but were on their way to work for example.
The Tsunami warning system has not worked properly.
Do you have any information?
We don't know the reasons, but when the warning came, many people thought "Okay, no tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions not hit by the tsunami, there was misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they ran on the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, which is on the Pacific fire ring, not prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the complete infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.

==References====External links==*Official website
In the coming winter, the Saalfeldener wants to reclaim the missed precious metal at the World Cup in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Olympia Sprint of Pyeongchang to grab the medal.
Seven tenths were missing on bronze at the end.
"I have consciously allowed time to process this," says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym fitness studio in his home town Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top form, but it just didn't want to be.
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to pick up the missing precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to get back to a big event with the Constitution.
Someday you'll have to hit.
The World Cup track in Östersund (SWE) is located in Eberhard: "I have already entered the heart of the race", he remembers with joys his fourth World Cup place in the single race last year.

Brett Kavanaugh: FBI study at the Turbotempo
The time is extremely short and the number of planned hearings is very limited.
With an FBI investigation in the Turbotempo, Republicans in the US Senate want to secure the high-thin majority for the judges' candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is disputed for emergency allegations.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline by Friday for the investigators to clarify the suspected incidents over 30 years.
The recent turnaround in the drama of Kavanaugh's vocation, accompanied by a cultural struggle, had been triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, in whose course the jurist was vehemently ousting against the opposition Democrats, the Senate Judicial Committee should clear the way for the final confirmation of the U.S. Supreme Court's arch-conservative judge.
The majority of Republicans seemed assured when suddenly Senator Jeff Flake declared against his original announcement that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who on Thursday still called the severe detentions "difficult," initially included further attacks against women and spoke on the contrary of "luck in misfortune".
In this way, he said, the last doubt could be resolved.
Later, during an election campaign, Trump attacked the Democrats sharply for rejecting Kavanaugh: "They are trying to block and destroy".
Trump arranges for FBI investigation in the case of Kavanaugh
The White House has also extremely limited the powers of the investigators.
One specifically investigated the known allegations of two women, no more, said a government representative to the Wall Street Journal: "They are not going for a fishing trip".
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
The mobile radar device installed in a "civil vehicle" of the town municipality of Ried for monitoring the tempo limit is stationed on the garden road, according to town municipality from Monday, October 1.
There is also the Federal School Centre.
The municipality also operates several installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You felt the fear
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first season victory against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first season win.
However, against Mainz the factor time also played a role.
Gelsenkirchen - Now it is well known that Christian Heidelberg is a giant pessimist at football games.
This was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I saw every ball in there.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty room," said Schalke 04 sports director and breathed up.
After all, the king's blues had succeeded in bringing the scarce 1:0 against the Rheinheß over time and thus the first season victory under the roof and subject.
In fact, it could have come differently.
After the leadership by Alessandro Schöpf 11th the team of Chief Trainer Domenico Tedesco had given security, Tedesco said: "In total, the first half-time was good, both playful and pressive".
Don't actually create a headball monster
"The last ten minutes felt like two hours to me," said Heidelberg, "if the team was only half as nervous as I was at the bank, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore moved on and on.
And defends with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three counters of the season.
"We all liked a huge stone from the heart," said the creator, who had no essential part to play with his headball hit: "I am actually the worst baseball player in the human race."
But in the end, only victory counts.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start with pressure at the beginning and make a fireworks," said Schalk's chief coach.
Victory was important.
Finally, we can enjoy a few hours.
I'm very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We've played intelligently, quietly and courageously, so we've got to deal with games over 90 minutes.
The probably the biggest deficiency of the afternoon: King Blue missed it, rather for clearer circumstances to worry about.
The possibilities were finally there, for example by the strong yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice hit the latte 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been a tremor," Tedesco said, "You've felt the fear a bit already."
That's why I'm glad we won.
He was not the only Schalker.
Fischbachau: Smoke column visible in the leitzachtal 2 km
The smoke was not to be overlooked.

Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at eye level
The author, Professor Aladin El-Mafalani, is in front of them.
He has followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild repeatedly.
"I have been tasked with bringing interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treff" - the association that cooperates with the alliance "Cultural Policy" in the orientation of the evening.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very easily, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject.
With a lot of gestures, hand-held numbers and one or another joke, he brings the audience closer to one of the most conflict-rich topics: migration and integration.
Why are there increasing conflicts despite successful integration?
The Syrian author is used to answer the question of a metaphor.
At one table the German society sits, at the catenary the migrants of the first generation.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to participate.
This leads to conflicts.
Therefore, it is important not to be politically left or right-wing, but rather to "I am for or against an open society?" he emphasizes.
In the beginning, behave rather, then always rule, the discussion starts.
And there is a need for speech.
From his perspective, an Afghan refugee tells two teachers how they see successful or unsuccessful integration with students.
El-Mafaalani stands up, not on stage, a symbol for the discussion: it is on the eye level.
The sociology professor does not push his opinion, emphasizes that he speaks of the average, not of individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the issue, because "the first time we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Mafalani.
During the subsequent signing hour, he also had an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, discussed intensively with prepared Kurdish specialities.

Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The need is apparently huge: over 100 interested parties applied for the purchase of one of the land in Landsham-South.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots in the new Landsham-South area on the free market.
This is what Mayor Roland Frick says.
In addition, the application phase is completed for those 20 plots that offer the municipality at more favourable conditions or prices - similar to the previous local model.
Well, 100 applications were received, according to Frick.
"Currently the documents will be examined" with regard to the application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the Mayor of Plieninger, the aim was to have established the list of candidates for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to present them to the Council of Municipalities.
After that, the award could be made.
A total of 50 plots for single and double houses are created on the southern part of Landsham and four plots for multi-family houses, each of which is expected to have eight housing units.
The development is now almost complete, the roads and roads will soon be paved.
A single plot and two of the multifamily houses belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells most of it on the free market, 20 plots in a socially compatible model.
According to Frick, the two multifamily houses of the municipality are to be built as affordable housing.
A total of 16 homes funded by the Free State, which are income-oriented.
Space for 200 people
It is estimated that about 200 people live in the area of the new Landsham-South area.
Not only that: Now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, the start is made for the new construction of a daycare centre.
It is intended to accommodate three kindergarten and three crib groups as well as a multipurpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, for the start of the next kindergarten year.
Schalkes Naldo also succeeds in "great sport" on the bank
For the third time in succession, Naldo does not thank Schalke-Trainer Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had been sitting on the exchange bench for the third time in a row, not in the Schalker Startelf, but in the Schalker Startelf, the understanding would have been great for many people, if the nearly two-metre-sized Brazilian once had spoken to the soul's frustration.
But when, after the 1:0 win over the FSV Mainz 05, the Schalker players gathered in the middle circle and thanked Chief Trainer Domenico Tedesco for all his professionals, the 36-year-old, all of whom call Naldo easy, turned in and said, "We have to thank him, coach!"
"That was very emotional, that was a great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction of his vice captain, who, despite his reservist being, had no grudge.
Probably Naldo, who was celebrated as the best schalker in the past season, knows that he is not actually on his coach's stand - but is given a break for good reasons.
A reason called load control.
It wasn't easy telling him.
"It wasn't easy telling him that, I tell you quite honestly," Tedesco told me the moment he told Naldo that he wasn't in the start-up.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the matter, it's about the club," explained Tedesco the step.
Naldo played against Bavaria and Porto for 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It's important that everyone can get through at the moment.
And that we all keep in the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation, which last captured Naldo as well.
And to whom the Brazilians responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also showing himself on the bank as an exemplary team player.
The atmosphere in Austria's industry has continued in August to speed up its valley journey compared to the Eurozone.
The shopping manager index (PMI) was 46.7 points on a 37-month trip.
However, Austria has its third best opinion behind Ireland and the Netherlands throughout Europe, the Markit Institute announced its survey of 3,000 companies on Monday.
Unlike in Austria, the Euro zone’s PMI increased by 1.1 to 45.1 points, but the index is still the 13th month in a row under the brand of 50 counters, indicating growth.
Only Ireland's industry hit this threshold in August at 50.9 points.
The closing lights were the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer fell, but slower than in the months before.
In Spain, the index has reached the highest level at 44.0 points since March.
"The slightly weakened valley ride could mean that the worst has survived," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
However, industry - at least in the third quarter - remains the number one growth brake.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the Eurozone were no longer as strong as since November 2011.
The companies therefore completed the seventh month in a row.
Industrial production also fell more than initially accepted in August in China.
The mood barometer sank from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The shopping manager index is based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, developments in turnover, employment, stocks and prices are raised.
