It not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but also provides details that fossils often cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangements.
The researchers say that this animal's plumage was chestnut brown on the top, with a pale or carotenoid-coloured underside.
The discovery also gives insight into the development of feathers in birds.
As the dinosaur springs do not have a well-developed shaft, so-called coil, but other characteristics of feathers – rays and bistulas – the researchers concluded that the coil was probably a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The structure of the springs indicates that they were not used for flying but instead for temperature regulation or for display. The researchers suggested that the specimen shows an adult spring suit and not chicken down, even if the tail comes from a young dinosaur.
The researchers said that even if this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the adult spring suit and not the young down.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made by the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by forces reminiscent of tidal water in the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the winter street.
Just as the moon exerts traction on the earth, which causes tides, Wintergatan exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The researchers found that the dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter does.
This theory says that the majority of dark matter around a galaxy is located in a kind of halo, and is made of lots of small particles.

"The thermal behavior of these caves is not as stable as large caves on the earth that often keep a relatively constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that these are deep holes in the ground," says Glen Cushing at the United States Geological Surveys (USGS) team for astrogeology and at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona."
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put a printed paper sheet with their chosen candidate in an envelope.
After officials have verified the electoral identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting document.
French electrician legislation codifies the approach rather strictly.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote and that no envelope is added except those duly counted from the competent voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers who are under extensive supervision and follow specific procedures.

Four skiers in the women's sitting group could not finish their ride and 45 of the 117 participating riders in the large slaloms failed to place themselves in the competition.
The Madhya Pradesh police took back the stolen laptop and cell phone.
"Vice Chief Inspector General D K. Arya said, "We've arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and found her cell phone and laptop."
The defendants are named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Detective Chandra Shekhar Solanki reported that they accused themselves of being arrested at the court with their faces covered.
Despite the fact that three people were in the house when the car collided with it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the rescue service cut the driver off from the red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrook Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been accused in Edinburgh's sheriff's court of murdering his son.
She is in custody awaiting prosecution and trial, but all eyewitnesses can become worthless because her image has been widely published.
This is common elsewhere in the UK but Scottish law works differently and courts have considered the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
"Professor Pamela Ferguson at Dundee University notes that ""journalists choose a dangerous line if they publish images etc. of suspects.""
The Crown Office, which has the overall responsibility for prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made before prosecution.
According to the leak, the document deals with the leak of the border dispute, where the Palestinians want the borders to be based on them before the six-day war of 1967.
Other subjects reported are Jerusalem's future, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley question.
Israel requests ten years of constant military presence in the valley after an agreement has been signed, while the PA only approves to leave such presence for five years.
Hunters in the additional pest control test would be closely monitored by park nurses when the experiment was observed and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, volunteers were recruited under Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, appointed director of park conservation and culture at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting mission received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore a new Provisional Election Council (CEP) in nine members yesterday.
It is Martylly's fifth provisional election council in the course of four years.
Last month, a president's commission recommended that the former Provisional Election Council should resign, as part of a package of measures to bring the country closer to new elections.
The Commission was Martylly's response to the extensive protests against the regime that started in October.
The partial violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have expired since 2011.
There have been reports of about 60 cases where misconstructed iPods overheated, causing a total of six fires and caused four people mild burns.
Japan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs, Trade and Industry (Methia) said that 27 accidents related to the units were known.
"METI announced last week that Apple had informed of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company called "smaller."
"The Department replied by calling Apple's postponement of the report ""very sorry."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Civil Protection Office announced that no damage has been reported in the country.
Even the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there was no indication of tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has held tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle against the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have so far been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later switched places with an older lady because she was in need of a toilet visit. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a medical career.
He trained as a child nurse and started working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature births during his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was given, it would be rapid in the lungs of the foetus.
"Xinhua reported that the government investigator carried two black boxes on Wednesday."
Brothers also hailed Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first boss. Luna died during the night with two moons. Quite unique just like her. Strong woman."
"Dustin" "Goldust" Runnels said in a comment that "Luna was as big a freak as I ... maybe even bigger ... love her and will miss her ... hopefully she's better where she is now."
Of 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal elections, the number who opposed Australia becoming a republic grew by 8% since 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that she considered Australia to be a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of the participants in the investigation share this view, that Queen Elisabeth II will become Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of those questioned believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallion would have swam 100 m and 200 freestyle as well as three baton races at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his trouble there have been doubts about his condition.
He has not been able to take the medicines needed to overcome his pain when they are banned in the competition.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest known prime number so far, on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery with different hardware and software at the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Kometer may have been a source of water resources on earth, along with organic material, which can form proteins and sustain life.
Since comets collided with the earth a long time ago, researchers hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how the earth was formed.
Cuomo, 53, took over his reign earlier this year and signed last month's bill to legalize same-sex marriages.
"He referred to the rumors as "political pladder and trams."
It is speculated that he will stand up in the 2016 presidential elections.
NextGen is a system that FAA claims would mean that the plane flies shorter distances, saves millions of litres of fuel each year, and reduces CO2 emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology in contrast to older ground radar-based technologies to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is cancelled, and trains over the ground will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride stations are not available at the ground level.
The fear of lack of means of transport opened up for the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published in Thursday’s Science magazine reported on the formation of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University reported that the new species developed in just two generations, although this process is believed to have taken much longer due to breeding between the endemic Darwinfinken, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant Españoladarwinfinken, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn to thin wire that can be twisted and plaited. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
"It can be done very thin and attached to other metals. It can be done so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand painted images in books called "enlightened manuscripts"."
This is called pH for a chemical. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The juice from the cabbage changes the hue depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The PH value is obtained from the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Stir together the two dry powders. Then mold them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel funny and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet with flushing in almost every house, with connection to a sophisticated sewer system.
Residues of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman society, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women stayed together.
When you call a hundred miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space gets the signal and reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was sent out into space using the rocket. Researchers use telescopes in space because the earth’s atmosphere distorts a little of our light and field of vision.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet [30 m] to get up a satellite or a telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world incredibly. The biggest thing the wheel has done is to give us much easier and faster transport methods.
It has given us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
They include more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose animal taxes) that eat a much larger amount of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret behind their success is the concept of a niche, a special job for every cat that keeps it from rivalling others.
Lions are the most social cat animals, and live in large groups called herds.
Flocks consist of one to three related adult males along with as many as thirty females and infants.
The females are often close to each other; a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lejob acts a lot like herds with wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly like lions (but not other large cats) in behavior, and also very deadly for their prey.
As the versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (but not well), swim, jump long distances and draw with five times the strength of a strong person.
Tiger is part of the same group (relative Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can rot.
The shaking of the tiger is not like the sounding of the lion, but more like a sense of roaring, screaming words.
Ozelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ozelot hunts are much smaller than it itself.
Scientists believe that ozelots follow and find animals to eat (bytes) through the smell, by sniffing on the ground where they found themselves.
They can see very well in darkness and even move very sneaky. Ocelots hunt their prey by melting into their surroundings and then throw themselves over the prey.
When a small group of living creatures (a small stock) are separated from the main stock from which they come (for example, if they move across a mountain chain or river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily recede), they often end up in an environment different from the one in which they were previously in.
This new environment has other resources and competitors, so to be a strong competitor, the new population needs functions or adjustments other than they needed before.
The indigenous population has not changed at all, they still need the same adjustments as before.
Over time, when the new population starts to adapt to its new environment, they start to look smaller and smaller like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process's specification, which simply means the formation of new species. Specification is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe and they take up human carbon dioxide (that is, breathe out).
Plants produce food using sunlight through photosynthesis. They also produce shade.
We build our houses of plants and manufacture our clothes of plants. Much of the food we eat is plants. Without the plants the animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain during its time, so it had nothing to be afraid of, except other mosaics.
The long jaws were obsessed with more than 70 sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the gum, which meant that there was no chance of running for something that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a split tongue, its diet includes turtles, large fish, other musasauria, and it may even have been cannibal.
It also attacked everything that came down into the water; even a gigantic dinosaur like T. rex was no match for it.
Although most of their food would be known to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual celebrations such as wild boar, poacher, snails, and a kind of rodent called hazelmus.
Another difference was that while the poor people and the woman ate their food while sitting in chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together where they could half lie on the side while they ate their meals.
Ancient Roman meals may not have included food coming to Europe from America or from Asia in recent centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, nor tomatoes, cocoa, or potatoes, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods that was considered the home of God.
People took offerings to the gods and the priests tried to appease the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple and then an inner shrine that only the priests had access to.
Sometimes special pyramid - shaped towers, known as ziqqurates, were built as part of the temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the Middle East's warm climate, the house was not so important.
Most of the lives of the Hebrew family took place outdoors.
Women cooked food on the farm; shops were just open dishes facing the street. Sten was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Nordic legends it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland as a penalty for murder, and that when he travelled west he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Regardless of his discovery, Eskimå tribes lived there already at the time.
"Although each country was "Scandinavian" there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history in Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland."
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a tax card on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is something on the back of the document, it is not a tax card.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776" were written."
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but we know that the large parchment (with dimensions of 75,6 cm x 62,2 cm) was rolled together for early storage in its existence.
So it is likely that the text was just written there as a label.
The landings on Day D and the subsequent battles had freed northern France, but the south was still not free.
"It was ruled by the "Vichy" French, who were French people who agreed with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the intruders instead of fighting them."
"On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and the free French forces had liberated southern France and turned against Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significant large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from Latin civilisation, which means citizens, and civitas, which means city or city state, and which also in some way defines the size of society.
Urban states are the leaders of the nations. A civilized culture means that knowledge is transferred between generations, a sustaining cultural footprint and a fair dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces, and are not recognised as real civilisations.
During the American war of freedom, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as the only component - according to the treaty articles.
The Congress lacked all the power to impose taxes and, since there was no national executive or ruling year, the authorities of the States, which were often incooperative, fell to implement all its decisions.
Nor did it have the power to abolish tax laws and duties between States.
The articles required unanimous approval by all Länder before they could be added and the states attached so little importance to the central government that their representatives were often absent.
Italy’s national football team, together with the German football team, is the world’s second most successful team and was a champion of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, bike, ice hockey, roller skate hockey and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (of which the largest is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
With its many islands, Japan often counts geographically as an archipelago.
Taiwan's history dates back to the 1400s when European sailors passing past the registered name of the island as Ilha Formosa, which means beautiful island.
In 1624 the Dutch East Indian Company founded a base in southwestern Taiwan and initiated a transformation of the production of origin of cereals and employs Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683 the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 Taiwan was declared a province of the Qingimperia.
After the defeat of 1895 in the first Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Shimonoseki Treaty, giving sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which then governs the island until 1945.
Machu picchu consists of three main structures, Intihuatana, Soltempel and Temple with the three windows.
Most of the buildings at the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they looked like in original.
At 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration still continues today.
For example, the most common format for still images in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film.
It is still manufactured today, but even more important is its image relationship inherited to the format of photo sensors in digital cameras.
The 35-millimeter format is slightly confusing, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio in this format (dividing twelve to achieve the simplest whole-digit relationship) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS format) correspond to this aspect ratio or are close to it.
The much abused and often ridiculed third-party rule is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while keeping a certain order in a picture.
It is claimed that the best location for the subject is where the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally are met (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was examined.
For over a thousand years, Christian religion had united European states despite their differences in languages and customs.
Its omnipresent power influenced everyone from king to common man.
One of Christianity’s main teachings says that wealth should be used to curb suffering and poverty and that the church’s funds are for that very purpose.
The central power of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money made many question whether this principle was fulfilled.
Shortly after the conflict broke out, Britain launched a seablock against Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective in cutting the necessary military and civilian supplies, even if this blockade broke the generally accepted international law codified in most international agreements over the last two hundred years.
Britain mined international waters to prevent all ships from crossing entire areas of the sea, making it risky even for neutral ships.
With a limited response to this tactics, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited underwater warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitude was pacifism and isolation of most inhabitants and countries.
After seeing the horrors and horrors of war during World War I, countries wanted to avoid repeating such a situation in the future.
Tesla moved to America's United States in 1884 to work at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents on his pocket, a poetry book and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
The old China had a unique way of distinguishing different periods of time; every stage in China’s history, or every family sitting in power, was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was also an unstable period in which the provinces were divided. The most famous of these periods were the three kingdoms, which occurred between the 60 years between the Han and Jindynastians.
During these periods violent warfare often took place between many nobles who fought over the throne.
The three kingdoms were one of the bloodiest times in the history of ancient China when thousands of people died in the battle to sit in the tallest chair of the great palace in Xi'an.
It became many social and political effects such as the use of the metering system, a transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and belief that the country belongs to the people and not a single ruler.
In addition, the professions were opened up to all men in search, which allowed the most ambitious and successful to find success.
The same applies to the military, as rank within the army was now founded on calibre instead of class.
The French revolution also inspired many other oppressed workers from the working class in other countries to make revolution.
"Muhammed was deeply interested in subjects beyond his everyday life. He often used to visit a cave known as "Hira" on the "Noor" mountain (light) to ponder."
The cave itself, which survived the course of time, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
The cave, which is located on one of the mountaintops north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It's actually not easy to find even if you know that there is. Inside the cave, it's total isolation.
There is nothing to see except the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from within the cave.
The great pyramid in Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exist today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Cheops Pyramid is one of many great pyramidal structures built to honor dead pharaohs.
The "Gizaplatån" or "Giza Necropolis" in the valley of Egyptian Death contains several pyramids (of which the great pyramid is the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples and the great sfinx."
The pyramid of Cheops was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, graves and temples were built to honor Khufu’s wives and family members.
"The mark for "up" stroke" looks like a V and the mark for "down" stroke" as a clip or a square that lacks the bottom side."
Up means that you should start at the tip and push the strand upwards, and down means that you should start at the frog (where your hand holds the line) and pull the strand down.
A stroke usually generates a softer sound, while a lower stroke is stronger and more resolute.
You can draw there your own markings, but bear in mind that the printed strip markings are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
The shrewd King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two little children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madam Élisabeth, was forced back to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789 by a bunch of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd screaming and shouting threats to the king and the queen.
The crowd forced the king and the queen to keep their chariot windows open at the gable.
On one occasion, one of the participants in the mob swung his head from an imperial guard killed at Versailles, in front of the mad queen.
The war expenses of the conquest of the Philippines by the American imperialists were paid by the Philippine people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the cost and interest on bonds in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the great profits that come from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the fundamental gains of American imperialism.
To understand the temple rulers, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The era of events is often referred to as the period of European history during the 1000s to the 1300s.
The peak time was preceded by the Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which formally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that embraces many different ideas in practice, from technology driving the development or technological imperative in the strict sense that man's fate is driven by a basic logic that belongs to the laws of nature and how they manifest themselves in technology.
"Most of the interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: that technology development itself follows a course which is largely beyond cultural or political influences, and that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are original, rather than socially dependent."
For example, it could be said that the motorized car inevitably leads to the construction of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically sustainable for just a small number of cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher occurrence of road accidents, leading to the invention of new medical technologies to repair damaged bodies.
Romance contained a major element of determinism originating from authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romance, geography formed individuals and in time customs and culture arose related to this geography, and these, which harmonized with the place of society, were better than arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the feudal European fashion capital.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began to circulate at about 400 C.E. and continued until about 1100 C.E.
Its influence decreased in the 1300s mainly because of the fact that crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were valued higher than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 1100-1200s and the 1300s.
At first, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slow lines of communication, styles in the west could lag after 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments as a result of the crusade was that people began using buttons to attach clothes.
Self-supporting agriculture is the agricultural sector that is being carried out for the production of sufficient food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family only.
Self-catering farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses stored seeds originating in the eco-region combined with rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximise yield.
Historically, most farmers were self-sufficient in agriculture and so are still in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by society and let them find their identity.
Subcultures can be distinct due to the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that determine a subculture that can be pronounced may be of linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical character, or it may be a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging by a distinctive and symbolic style choice, which includes fashion, manner and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look at the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, accident or deliberate abuse, are not socialized by adults during their childhood.
"Such children are called "wild"". Some wild children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases the abandonment of the child was because the parents rejected the serious intellectual or physical disabilities of a child."
Wild children may have experienced serious abuse or trauma before they are abandoned or moved.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wilderness on their own.
When the wild child is raised entirely by non-human animals, it exhibits behavior (within physical limits) almost identical to that of the specific care animal, such as its fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, support education goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a support to individuals learning something new, for example using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of support, but it is also the small gem man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support is internalized in the software and is intended to question, guide and explain methods that may have been too challenging for the student to handle himself.
Children are placed in foster homes for many different reasons, from maltreatment to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not educational, caring or educational, but that happens.
We believe that the foster home system is a safe zone for these children.
Our family home system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable healthcare.
Fosterhem is there to offer all the necessities that were missing in the home they previously came from.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions of user theory.
"For example, "learning" and "socialisation" are proposed as important grounds for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Also "personal engagement" and "continuous relations" were identified as new motivational aspects of Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined the audience's reactions to websites."
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries within the interpretation of micro expression, facial expressions lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to determine whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro expression.
"Oliver Sacks showed in his writing "The President's Numbers" how people who can't understand numbers due to brain damage can still judge sincerity correctly."
He even claims that we share such knowledge in interpreting human behavior with animals as domestic dogs.
Research in the 1900s has shown that there are two areas of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of pronounced variation.
Segregation and recombination disks variations back and forth between the two poles for each new generation.
Out on the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system such as man's to satisfy his need for amino acids from the plants available.
In addition, there is a lack of this serious impact; inhibited growth, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to melt unless they are prepared.
By comparison, animal food (anthrax, termites, eggs) is not only mildly digested, but also offers high quality proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
"Whenever it comes around, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in about the same way that chimpanzees in the savannah do today."
Sleep interruptions are the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10–60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that brings you closer to your consciousness without fully awakening you.
If you usually turn off the clock in your sleep, you can put it in the other end of the room, so you have to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorythm-based alternatives involve drinking lots of fluid (especially water or tea, a known fluid driver) before sleeping, which means you have to go up and pee.
The amount of inner peace a person has correlated opposite to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the present life force is. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha’s teachings, but has expanded with the path of love within Mahayana and many techniques within Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundaliniyoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
The kundalini yoga generates the kundalini energy (information energy) through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantran and visualizations.
God Yogan is central to Tibetan meditation. By visualizing different gods, the energy channels are cleansed, chakras activated and enlightened consciousness created.
Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. When the war ended, the differences in systems, process and culture led to the collapse of cooperation between the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be physically fought by contract armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when over 800 000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered into and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland and at the same time breaking the peace agreement in Riga, the non-aggression pact between the Soviets and Poland and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the sea is to use ships to transport goods.
The work of the fleets has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while disrupting the enemy’s ability to move people and goods.
One of the most remarkable late examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. Americans tried to move troops and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, mainly using submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain in the same way as the rest of Europe.
Getter seems to have been domesticated only about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
The ancient cultures and tribes had them to get milk, fur, meat and skin.
Tamgetter was usually kept in shovels that walked on hills or other pastures, often rolled by herds that were often children or young people, similar to the more famous sheep herd. These methods of walling are still used today.
Tramways for wagons were built in England already in the 1500s.
Although carriageways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, the horses who drew them to achieve higher speeds and pull greater loads than on the narrower roads of the day.
Slips were introduced quite early to keep the tracks in place. However, it was gradually realized that the tracks would become more effective if they had a layer of iron at the top.
This came to be practice, but the iron went further on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. The first rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of transport was migration, people began to go upright two million years ago when Homo Erectus (meaning the righteous man) saw the light of day.
Their predecessors, Australopithecus, did not have the habit of going upright.
Bipedala specializations have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3,9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have gone on two legs already seven million years ago.
We can start to live in a more environmentally friendly way, we can engage in the environmental movement, and we can also become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is in many cases as symptomatic treatment, but if we don't just want a temporary solution, we have to find the root of the problems and deactivate them.
It appears with all due clarity that the world has changed greatly because of the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and the problems have worsened because of overpopulation and the extravagant way of life of mankind.
After it was adopted by the Congress on 4 July, a handwritten draft was sent, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
"During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap Broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon at the farm in Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which was read for its troops in New York on July 9, and a copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 of Dunlap's broad pages known to still exist are the oldest preserved copies of the document. The handwritten original has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still exist today. We call them birds.
Many do not think of them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things in birds that still look like in the dinosaurs.
They have feet with rocks and claws, they lay eggs and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
As well as all computers used today are based on manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1 and these numbers are called binary numbers - or bits to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning is not always immediately noticed. Symptoms such as vomiting are too general for an immediate diagnosis to be made.
The best sign of poisoning can be an open bottle of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
The term excavators is used in formal meaning by entomologists for this group of insects.
This term comes from ancient relatives with a walled glass, insects that are tightly adapted to parasites on humans.
Both rough skins and pavements are housekeepers, adapted to live in its hosts or home.
In the United States, there are about 400 000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and the optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have MS than men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their interest, or for the best of their children, to raise a child.
These couples may choose to establish an adoption plan for their child.
During an adoption, biological parents refuse their rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main objective of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method is indicative of almost all research.
However, it is not alone. To experiment, where an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, to ask questions and make observations, also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle’s view on all scientific issues, including psychology, was accepted.
When the knowledge of Greek diminished, the Western world found itself cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often largely due to the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms that are not just reactions to external periodic signals have been documented in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
A biological clock is a self-winding oscillator that repeats its cycle for a period of time even in the absence of external influence.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the main clues that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used trades, or viruses, to plant their own DNA in a bacterium.
They did two experiments that marked either the DNA of the substance with a radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the substance with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations may have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the genetic material affected and whether the cells affected are sex cells.
Only mutations in reproductive cells can be inferred to children, while mutations in other places can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of experiencing the landscape, including its flora and fauna.
Examples of activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is to visit, photograph and learn more about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small country cities in cars to go to their jobs and pass by others whose destination for work is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic shuttle traffic, everyone is somehow connected with, and supports, a transport system based on private carism.
Science now shows that this massive coal economy has disrupted the biosphere from one of its stable conditions that have supported human development over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. In principle, all complain about transport systems.
In countries, similar complaints about water quality or ravines are rarely heard.
Why do transport systems generate so much complaints, why do they fall on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more basic that happens?
Traffic flow is the study of how individual drivers and vehicles move between two points and how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, traffic flows are difficult to study, as processing cannot be predicted with 100% safety.
As is well, motorists tend to behave reasonably consistently; thus, traffic tends to float on rather consistent and can largely be presented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, connections have been established between three main variables: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These conditions help to plan, design and operate structures along the roads.
The insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid the enemy more easily and to find food and partners more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to trap their wings along with their bodies.
This gives them more small spaces where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot trap their wings are witchlands and daylands.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchos said that the solar system was moving around the sun.
Some people thought he was right but many thought otherwise; that the solar system was moving around the earth, including the sun (and also the other stars).
This seems reasonable, since it does not feel like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the world's most water-rich and second longest river. Its water flow is more than 8 times the size of the second largest river.
Amazonas is also the widest river on Earth, 9 km wide in some places.
A total of 20 percent of the water flowing into the oceans from Earth’s rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main sheep of the Amazon River is 6,387 km away. It gets its water getting thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the pyramid building in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza’s size and engineering were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the new kingdom marveled at the monument of their predecessors, who by then were well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican State has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country that has the lowest number of inhabitants.
The Vatican State uses Italian legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of the Vatican State are Roman Catholics.
People have known of basic chemical substances such as gold, silver and copper since antiquity, as these can be detected in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had a theory that everything consisted of one or more of four elements, earth, water, air and fire.
This was more like the four phases of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he had theories of switching to new substances to create what we see.
Alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many different elements in the periodic table.
Substances such as calcium and potassium are considered to be metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic substances such as coal.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can take their place at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil pen was a faithful companion to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, once new writing methods have been developed, the lead lead voltage has been lowered and fewer uses.
Today people write messages on computer screens, and never need to get near a pencil sharpener.
You can only wonder what it is from the keyboard when something newer comes.
The fission bomb is based on the principle that energy is needed to achieve a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Kind of like rolling a heavy wagon up a hill. Cutting the core again, releasing part of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable cores and not much is needed to break them down.
The surface of the moon consists of stones and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The shoe is about 70 km thick on the right side and 100 km thick on the other side.
It is thinner under the moon and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more maria on the nearby side because the crust is thinner there. It made it easier for lava to climb up to the surface.
Content theories revolve around finding out what gets people going or what appeals to them.
Theories claim that people have certain needs and/or requests that are internalised afterwards become adults.
These theories look at what makes some people want to have what they want and what they want in their environment is what makes them do or don't do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's needs hierarchy and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
"In general, two behaviors can occur when bosses begin to lead their former hostages. At one end of the spectrum, the boss tries to remain "the one in the gang."
This type of boss has difficulty making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities and keeping people responsible.
At the other end of the spectrum, one turns into an unrecognizable person who feels that he or she has to change everything that the team has done and make it his or her own.
After all, the leader is the most responsible if the team succeeds or fails.
This behavior often results in gaps between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams hold the same high standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members tend to act as a contact point for the physical group.
They often have more to say than conventional team members when different time zones can affect when their team can meet and this may not be understood by the management locally.
"The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team."
"The "invisible team" is the management group to which all members report. The invisible team sets the standards for each member."
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation? An objective of starting to use organisational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and inventiveness can be flourished.
Therefore, the process of an organisation working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets customer needs.
Before an organisation can become innovative, leadership must create an innovation culture as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuous approach as a method used to support organisations in achieving a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological information provides physical evidence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognitives. Therefore, it makes the research area narrower and much more precise.
The correlation between brain diseases and behavior supports researchers in their research.
It has long been known that various brain damage, trauma, diseases and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technology allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that we have not seen before.
This gives us much information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our mind.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that includes the behaviour, learning and intelligence of machines.
Research within AI is about getting machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, ability to respond to customer diagnosis and questions, and recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
Such things have become separate disciplines, which focus on offering solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now often used in economics, medicine, technology and the military, and has been built into several home computers and TV games software applications.
Field studies are a large part of the teaching in each class. The teacher often wants to take the students to places where there are no buses.
Technology offers solutions with virtual study visits. Students can watch museum objects, visit a aquarium, or admire beautiful art sitting with their class.
Sharing a study trip virtual is also a good way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state capital; the website is made every year, but previous versions may remain online as a clipboard book.
Blogs can also help to improve students’ writing. Students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of readers improves this in general.
Then students are often the most critical readers try the blogger to write better to avoid criticism.
Blogging "also forces students to become more aware of the world." The demand to satisfy readers' interest stimulates students to be clippery and interested (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning beyond the traditional school day.
"Suitable use of blogs" can give students the opportunity to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet material, students can define their positions in relation to what others have written, and explain their own perspectives on specific questions (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and offers a range of galleries and museums showing Canada's present and present time.
Further south lies the Niagara Falls and in the northern part there is the beautiful, untouched nature of Muskoka.
All of this and more, Ontario stands out with what outsiders consider to be the women's essence of Canada.
Large areas further north are very sparsely populated, and some are almost unoccupied wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent of its own with regard to fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or belong to France, and are known as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to the territories, which was greatly impacted in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began during the 1400s after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama rounded the Godauppsudden and thus found the waterway from Europe to India.
The region borders in the north to Sahel and in the south and west to the Atlantic.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is good to also wear a ring (not just one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they would consider to be harassment, and it is not uncommon for someone to follow one, take hold of one's arm, etc.
Be determined when you say no to men and do not be afraid to stand on you (cultural differences do not ok!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by barber fishermen during the 1000s BC and was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the merenides as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca. Just to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city of Daru l-Badya which was named Casablanca by Spanish traders as established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping throughout Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tagine, ceramics, leather products, water pipes and an entire spectrum of crimps, but all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located very far east near the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the volcano Nyiragongo, which buried most of the streets of the city, especially in the central parts.
Goma is fairly safe, but if you are going to visit outside Goma, you should examine what it looks like with the fighting in the northern Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing on the volcano Nyiragongo along with some of the cheapest tracks of mountain gorilla in Africa.
You can use the boda-boda (motorbike taxi) to get around in Goma. The normal (local) price for the short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
"Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, remote places."
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was included in the list of threatened world heritage because of the desert sand threat.
It was one of the major arrests of Henry Louis Gates PBS program Wonders of the African world.
The city stands in stark contrast with the other cities of the country, with an atmosphere that is Arab rather than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and extends along the border to Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, while the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19 500 km2 and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, each with different wild animals.
It is one of the largest sights in South Africa and it is considered to be the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all other South African national parks, the park charges daily nature conservation and entrance fees.
It can also be beneficial to buy a Wild Card, which either gives access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives Hong Kong's territory its name and is the main focus of many tourists.
The buildings in a row that make up Hong Kong’s silhouette have been likened to a glittering stack chart reinforced by the water in Victoria’s port.
To see the best views in Hong Kong, leave the island and head for Kowloon's lakeside opposite.
The vast majority of the settlement on Hong Kong Island is densely packed on the former seabed along the northern coast.
This is the place the British colonizers took over, so if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past of the area, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world and extends 80 km into Bangladesh and the Indian inland from the coast.
Sundarbans has been adopted on UNESCO's World Heritage List. That part of the forest located on Indian territory is called Sundarban's National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove — they contain some of the last remaining sites of the great jungles that once covered Ganges Plains.
Sundarban covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which approximately one third are wetlands.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife reserve, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengali tigers and about 30,000 axihjorts in the area.
Buss depart from the district bus station (over the river) all day, but most, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, go between 6.30 and 7.30.
Since buses between the districts are often full, it is a good advice to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are operated by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Shared taxi cars are a fast and convenient way to get to places nearby, such as Paro (150 Now) and Punakha (200 Now).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable bridge. It stretches across the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guyana.
The two towers rise 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two corridors of 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The building was completed in August 2011, it was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be operational in September 2017, as the Brazilian customs stations are expected to be ready.
Guaraní was the most important people of origin who inhabited the current eastern Paraguay and lived as semi-Nomad hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was populated by other groups of native tribes such as Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived as hunters, collectors and fishermen.
"In the 1500s Paraguay was born, formerly known as the "Indiens giant province", as a result of the meeting between the Spanish conquerors and groups of the native population."
The Spaniards began the colonization period of three centuries.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537 Paraguay has managed to retain much of its domestic character and identity.
Argentina is well known for being among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year will take place in December at the Polobrana in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and games can also be seen here during other times of the year.
For tournament news and where you can buy tickets to Polomatcher, please contact Asociacion Argentina de polo.
The official Falklands currency is the Falklands Pound (FKP) whose value corresponds to the value of a British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged on the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
GBP is usually received everywhere on the islands, and Stanley often pays with credit cards and USD.
Credit cards will probably not be accepted on the remote islands, but British and American currencies can be accepted; contact the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland currency outside the islands, so change money before you leave the islands.
Because Montevideo is located south of the equator it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; during the summer months it is common with temperatures above +30°C
Winter can be fraudulent cold: the temperature rarely falls below zero, but the wind and humidity are combined and make it feel cooler than the thermometer says.
"There are no special "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains about the same throughout the year."
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you should stay at least 100 meters from bears and wolves and 25 meters from all the other wild animals!
No matter how fragile they may look, bison bulls, elks, kandhajorts, bears and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep adequate distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
In addition, consider the smell of bears and other wild animals, so as to avoid having or cooking food that smells and keeping the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia. Located on the island of Upolu, it has a population of just under 40,000.
Founded in the 1850s, Apia has been Samoa's official capital since 1959.
The port was the scene of an infamous deadlock in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom refused to leave the port.
All ships were lowered, except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the murder of the Supreme Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches due to Auckland's location between two ports. The most popular beaches are divided into three areas.
North Shore's beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located by the Pacific Sea and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and in most of them the maorimyrten offers shade.
Tamaki Drives beaches are located at Waitemata Harbour, in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes well visited family beaches with a good range of shops located on the beach. Swimming is safe.
"The main local beer is "Number one", which is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be able to travel better.
The local drinking water is completely safe to drink, but water in the bottle is easy to find if you are worried.
"For the Australians, the idea of "flat white" coffee is unknown. A "short black" is "espresso", cappuccino has a high with cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk."
The hot chocolate milk meets the Belgian standard. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
There are many trips to the reef all year round and damage due to any of these causes on the reef is rare.
Yet, take the advice of the authorities, obey all the signs and be very attentive to security warnings.
Kubmaneter occurs close to beaches and close to estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can sometimes also be found at other times.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodile’s main habitat is located in the estuaries north of Rockhampton, so they usually do not live in the sea.
Pre-booking provides the traveller with security and assurance that they will have somewhere to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with special hotels, but it may be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, transfer to and from the airport, and even package tours that combine flights and hotels.
They can also reserve your reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or obtain additional documents required for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, all changes and requests should go through the travel agency first, and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the overwhelming majority of the visitors of the music festival decide to camp on site, and most visitors see it as an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to where things happen, you have to come early to get a campsite close to the music.
Remember that even if the music performances on the main stage have stopped, parts of the festival can continue to play music until late into the night.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with small children.
If you cross the North Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, because walking through the ice causes really terrible sounds for those who are most affected.
Cruises to St Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see the conditions).
Casinos usually do everything they can to make the guests spend as much time and money as possible. There are often no windows or watches, and the exits are often difficult to find.
They usually have special offers of food, drink, and pleasure to keep the guests at ease and make them stay in the room.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages free of charge. But intoxication weakens judgment, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who is going to drive at high latitudes or over mountain passes should be aware that snow, ice and temperatures below freezing may occur.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low and you cannot drive in the same way as on bar asphalt.
During snowstorms it can fall in a very short time enough snow to get stuck.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or snowfall or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues almost continuously all year round.
Safarier is perhaps the largest tourism industry in Africa and the highlight of many visitors.
The term safari in popular use refers to trips across the country to see the amazing African wild animals, especially on the safari.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars and with standard equipment it is possible to see them well.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shady and you see them better with binoculars.
"Gående safari (also called "bush walk" and "hiking safari") consists of walking either for a few hours or for several days."
Paralympics will be packed between 24 August and 5 September 2021. Some events will be held in other places around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia that has hosted two Summer Olympics, because one hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the launch was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policies for the corona virus look different, but by the end of March most of them do not go as far as July 2020, when the Olympic Games would have started.
It is expected that most tickets for events will cost between 2 500 and 130 000 yen, with a typical ticket price around 7 000 yen.
The ironing of damp clothing can help them dry. Many hotels have a iron and ironing board that can be borrowed, even if it is not in the room.
If no iron is available, or if you do not want to wear dry socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if one is available.
Be watchful and do not let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or in extreme cases sweat).
There are different sets of clean water on, and some are more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas it is enough to boil the water for one minute, in others it takes several minutes.
Filters may vary in efficiency, and if you are unsure, you should consider buying your water in a closed bottle from an established company.
Travelers can run into pests they are not familiar with from their home regions.
Injury can destroy food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people with violence, are usually not classified as pests.
Tax-free shopping is the possibility to buy goods without tax or other supplements in some places.
Travelers on their way to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The distance between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which often passes through isolated jungle terrain.
If you are not used to driving on highways, run with sense: steep slopes, narrow lanes and two curves are common.
Fixed speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections - usually 56-64 km/h (35-40 mph) - and that they are followed even more important than otherwise.
Strangely enough, mobile coverage is much better here than along many other routes, such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are really good, and in Bavaria they are quite powerful and varied, similar to those from the south, Austria.
Pastries with fruit are common, with apples baked in the pastry all year round and cherries and plums during the summer.
Many German pastries also have almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cookies are often particularly suitable with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but powerful pastries, you can try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
"A curry can be either "dry" or "humid" depending on the amount of fluid."
In northern India and Pakistan’s inland regions, yogurt is often used in curry dishes; in southern India and some other subcontinent coastal regions, coconut milk is often used.
With 17 000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a collection name that includes a wide variety of regional dishes spread throughout the country.
But if it is used without a term of determination, the term tends to mean the food that originally came from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, which is now available all over the eye, offers a selection of simple spicy dishes, where the flavourers that the javanese use most are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Trailers support the rider's feet hanging down on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but may pose a safety risk as the rider's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown by a horse but has got stuck with a foot in the ladder, he can be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimise this risk, a number of security measures can be taken.
First of all, most riders have boots with heel and a smooth, quite narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety rods that ensure that a stairwell escapes from the saddle if it is pulled back by a rider falling off.
Cochamó Valley, Chile's main destination for climbing, is known as South America's Yosemite, and has a number of large cliffs and walls in granite.
The mountaintops offer views that can take your breath away. Climbers from all corners of the world constantly create new routes among the countless mountain walls.
Excursion, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is popular sports where you glide down a snow-clad landscape with skis or a snowboard strapped to your feet.
Skiing is an activity that attracts many enthusiasts, sometimes called skiers, who plan the whole holiday trip around skiing in a certain area.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings representing skiers are dated as far back as 5,000 B.C.E.!
Outsourcing as sport has existed at least since the 1600s, and in 1861 the first leisure ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: this activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski skiing or skiing.
It is related to but usually does not involve alpine skiing or rock climbing, the latter is performed in steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as of a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cope with a slightly greater distance than walking – but you rarely get up at speeds like when cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack in pre-paired tracks.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but with many independent countries. In normal circumstances, travel through several countries would require visa applications and passport checks on several occasions.
The Schengen area, however, acts somewhat like a country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone you can generally cross borders without going through passport checks several times.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa in each Schengen Member State separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured objects are antiques. Some tax agencies define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where age limits can be shorter in North America, for example, than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be defined as antiques, although they are not as old as similar mass-produced goods.
Purification is an important supply among the Sami and the culture surrounding trade is also important for many with other professions.
Even historically, not all Sami have been involved in large-scale reindeer farming, but have lived by fishing, hunting and similar and used the reindeer most as tugs.
Today, many Sami people work in modern industries. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the area of Sami.
"Although it is often used, especially in non-Romani, the word "tenders" is often regarded as offensive because of its associations with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about romanians."
If the country you visit becomes the subject of a travel restriction, your travel insurance policy or cancellation protection may be affected.
You may also want to consult governments other than your own, but their advice is designed for their own residents.
For example, for American citizens in the Middle East there may be other circumstances compared to Europeans or Arabs.
A travel council is just a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The picture presented is often fast, general and simplified compared to the more detailed information available from other sources.
Extreme weather is the general term for all dangerous weather phenomena with the potential to cause damage, serious social disturbances or the loss of human life.
Difficult weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different variations of them, which may be due to geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong wind, hail, heavy precipitation and running fire are the types and consequences of extreme weather, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, clouds and cyclones.
Regional and seasonally severe weather phenomena include intense snow storms, storms of air, ice storms and sandstorms.
Travelers are strongly recommended to be aware of the risk of severe weather affecting their area, as this may affect the itinerarys.
Anyone planning to visit a country that can be regarded as a war zone should receive professional training.
"A search on the Internet after "fiscal environmental education" is likely to give the address of a local company."
A course usually goes through all the questions mentioned here but much more detailed, usually with practical exercises.
A course usually lasts between 2-5 days and includes role playing, very first aid and sometimes weapon training.
There are plenty of books about how to survive in the wilderness, while books about war zones are rare.
Travelers planning a gender correction operation abroad must ensure that they hold valid documents for the journey home.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without specified gender (X) or documents updated to match a desired name or gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies just as much.
Investigations at security controls have also become significantly more urgent in the post-11 September 2001 period.
Non-operational trans-persons shall not expect to pass through the X-ray check with the integrity and dignity of the retention.
Rip currents are the returning flow from waves that break off at the beach, often at a reef or similar.
The underwater topology makes the reflux concentrated in a few deeper parts, and strong currents that lead to deep water can be formed there.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue after attempting to swim back countercurrent, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the stream, it's not more difficult than normal to swim back.
Try to aim somewhere where you don’t get caught again or, depending on your skills and whether you’ve been discovered, wait to be rescued.
The return shock comes earlier than the cultural shock (there is not as much of a honeymoon phase), goes on longer and can be more serious.
Travelers who have had easy time to adapt to new cultures sometimes find it difficult to adapt to their original culture.
Upon returning from a foreign residence, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of your home culture’s habits.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, because of the knowledge that travelers in a new country must adapt.
People may not expect patience and understanding to be necessary for travelers who return home.
The sound and light show of the pyramids is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Usually you always hear the sounds of tourists and retailers. The audio and light story is just like a fairy tale book.
The background is made up of Sphinxen, who tells a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids, and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are several countries claiming, and they have the most bases, of which sixteen are active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of Halvön. The largest island is King George Island with the community of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception where the flooded crater of an active volcano forms a spectacular natural port.
Ellsworth's country is the region south of the peninsula, and borders the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains merge here with the plateau and then come back to form the 360 km long Ellsworth mountain chain, which is divided into the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range has Antarctica's highest mountain, Vinson massif, with a peak of 4892 m in Mount Vinson.
In remote locations without mobile coverage, a satellite phone can be your only option.
A satellite telephone generally does not replace a mobile phone, as you have to be outdoors with a clear term line to the satellite in order to be able to call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions that need remote data and voices.
Your local telecommunications operator should be able to provide you with more information on how to connect to this service.
Traveling and learning is an increasingly popular option for those planning a free year.
This is particularly popular among newly graduates, which allows them to take a year off before the university without jeopardising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a sabbatical course abroad may actually increase the chances of getting into a higher education in your home country.
Usually, a fee is charged to register on these educational programmes.
Finland is very boat friendly. The land of the thousand lakes also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the archipelagos.
In the archipelago and lakes you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the archipelagos and the largest lakes are really big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak can offer a different experience.
Boat life is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat of every seven or eight persons.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Most of the specific Baltic cruises include a longer stay in St Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city a few good fortunes while you return to and sleep at the ship's nightlife.
If you only land with ship excursions, you do not need a separate visa (from 2009).
Some cruises include the German capital Berlin in its brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by air can be a frightening experience for people, regardless of age and background, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is not different from the personal fear and reluctance of other things that many people have.
Understanding how aircraft work and what happens during a flight can help some people overcome a fear that is caused by discomfort to the unknown or by lack of control.
Kurir companies have paid well to deliver things quickly. Often, time is very important when it comes to business documents, merchandise or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes the larger companies have their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller companies there was a problem.
If they have sent things by air freight, on some routes it may have taken several days to go through unloading and customs.
The only way to get it faster was to send it as checked in baggage. Airlines rules do not allow you to send baggage without a passenger, and this is where you get into the picture.
The obvious way to fly in first class or business class is to spend a lot of money on the privilege (or even better, let your company do it for you).
However, this will not come at a cheap price: as a rough thumb rule you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy price for business and eleven times for first class!
In general, it is no idea to even look for discounts for seats in business or first class on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of travellers who are prepared to pay well for the privilege to travel anywhere quickly and comfortably. The company also charges the fees accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is common.
Moldova is a multinational republic that has been affected by ethnic conflicts.
In 1994 this conflict led to the creation of the self-depressed Transnistria Republic of eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but which is not recognised by any of the UN Member States.
Economic relations have been restored between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of the political negotiations.
The largest religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
The city, which in historical times was called Smyrna, is today a modern, developed city and a lively commercial center situated at a huge port surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades and modern shopping centers are mixed with traditional red-capped roofs, 1700s market and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that is more like Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy, and has an unusual eight-sided church.
At the cemetery there are interesting marble statues of pigeons over some of the graves.
It's worth walking around half an hour in the captivating village.
Within reach of the north there is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra and who became famous among foreigners after a shimmering account of its grandeur of Lord Byron.
Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, also visit the fantastic Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (healing), a place world famous for the revelations of Mary.
Remember that you are actually visiting a mass grave site and a place that has an almost invisible significance to a significant part of the world’s population.
There are still many men and women in life who survived their time here, and many more who had close and loved who were murdered or worked here; Jews as well as non-Jews.
Use the site with the great dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Don’t joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not vandalise the site by painting or scraping graffiti on structures.
Barcelona’s official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, an overwhelming majority understand that, and almost everyone can Spanish.
Most of the signs, however, are only in Catalan, since according to law it is the primary official language.
However, Spanish is also used in many public transport and other establishments.
Common messages in the metro are only made in Catalan, but unplanned interferences are reported by an automated system in a variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude and arrogant.
"Although this is often just a wrong stereotype, the best way to survive in Paris is still to behave in the best way and behave like someone who is "bien élevé" (welbred). It will make it much easier to get around."
The Parisians' brutish exterior will quickly disappear if you show yourself from your articulate side.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is grown with dense forest, the main crop with book, spruce and gem, and has a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a striking abundance of species, due to the extent of microclimates, different soils and varying heights.
The area is also home to an extreme diversity of animal and bird species.
Rare species of animals such as European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lagomorphs, wild cat and goats are found there, along with many more common species
When visiting the monastery, women must wear a dress covering their knees and also have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries give shawls to women who have not prepared themselves in advance, but if you bring with you your own, especially one with bright colors, you get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
According to the same logic, men have to dress in pants that cover their knees.
This can also be borrowed from the warehouse in the entrance but they are not washed after each person so you may not feel comfortable using these dresses. A size is all applicable to men!
Mallorcan food, as well as that in similar areas around the Mediterranean Sea, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses continuous olive oil.
A simple, popular dinner, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and optional available accessories such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as you for the pronoun you, are written in great initial letters, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important method of distinguishing between certain verbs and objects.
According to some, it also makes it easier to read, although the need to understand whether a verb or adjective is in noun form makes writing somewhat more complicated.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian because most words are spoken exactly as they are written
The letters to look out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies based on the following vocals.
Also make sure to express r and rr different: caro means dear, while carro means wagon.
The Persian has relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, you can get good help in learning a lot about Persian grammar and understanding sentences better if you read this grammar base book.
Of course, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese if you already know a Romance language.
But people who know a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough for it not to be studied separately.
Pre-existing observatories are usually outdated today and remain as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution during their magnificence was not the type of problem they are today, they are usually found in cities or in university areas, easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote locations with favourable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami, or beheld by the cherry flower, has been part of the Japanese culture since the 700s.
The concept came from China where plums were used.
In Japan the first cherry-flower festivals were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so try to resist the temptation to remove "only one" copies.
"If you visit an arranged garden, and you pick an "Examples"" it will also get you thrown out, without discussion."
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to stay and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything after arrival.
"But with its position in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator you have to handle both hot (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, more rarely)."
There are also a small number of buses heading north to Hebron, the traditional burial site where Bible patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives rest.
Check that the bus you are thinking about going to Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement Kiryat Arba.
Internal waterways can be a good starting point to base a holiday around.
For example, visit castles in Loiredalen, the Rhine Valley or take a boat trip to interesting cities on the Danube or a trip along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important weekends in Christianity and is celebrated as Jesus' birthday.
Many of the traditions around the weekend have also been raised by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition to spend the Easter night awake at some open place to see the sunrise.
There are of course Christian theological explanations of this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold a Easter Mass on Saturday evening during the Passover weekend. At midnight the congregation then breaks up to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All animals that originally arrived in the islands came here by either swimming, flying or floating.
Because of the long distance from the continent, mammals could not get over, so the giant turtle became the primary grazing animal on Galapagos.
Since man’s arrival in the Galápagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic winter areas, you will experience polar nights, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a great opportunity to see the Northern Light, because the sky is darker or less 24 hours a day.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the starry sky.
The Japanese working culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners may be accustomed to.
Costume is the normal business dress, and colleagues address each other with a last name or with a job title.
Harmonisation in the workplace is crucial, with emphasis on joint efforts rather than highlighting the performance of individuals.
Workers often have to be given the approval of their superiors for all decisions they make and are expected to follow the instructions of their superiors without doubt.
