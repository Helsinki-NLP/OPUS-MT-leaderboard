The main task of the kings was to set up a tomb of which one thought it would seem as timeless as the stars would be over the sand of the time, in which otherwise everything would sink. The planning of the afterlife was more important than the life itself, which was only the way there.

Certainly much was beautified, and in later times even battles that had not taken place at all were depicted.
