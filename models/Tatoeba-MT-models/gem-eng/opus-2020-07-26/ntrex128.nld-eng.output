Members of the Wales National Assembly are concerned that they “will be compared with Muppets”
A proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of the Welsh Parliament) is in shock among the members of the National Assembly of Wales.
The proposal is a consequence of the plans to change the current name ‘Welsh Assembly’ to ‘Welsh Parliament’.
Members of the National Assembly of various political parties are concerned that the new name is ridiculous.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Labour Party said that MWP ‘roughs on Twp and Pwp’.
For readers outside Wales: twp is Welsh for fools and pwp is Welsh for poop.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Plaid Party said that the group as a whole was 'dissatisfied' and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welshe Conservative Party said that his party is 'open' for the name change, but notes that the words MWP and Muppet are very similar.
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced as a short one.
The Commission of the National Assembly of Wales, which is currently drafting legislation to carry out the change of name, said: 'Of course, the members of the National Assembly of Wales themselves are taking the final decision on their new title.'
With the Government of Wales Act 2017, the members of the Wales National Assembly were given the right to change the name of the Assembly.
In June the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people felt that the National Assembly should be renamed Parliament.
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission proposed ‘Welsh Parliament Members’ or ‘WMPs’, but the MWP option received the most support in the public consultation.
At present, members of the National Assembly would propose alternatives, but President Elin Jones will find it difficult to reach consensus, and in a few weeks it will have to draft legislation on the changes.
The reform legislation also includes other changes to the way the National Assembly works, including rules on the suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the system of committees.
Members of the National Assembly will finally be able to vote on their new title when they debate legislation.
People of Macedonia vote in a referendum on the change in the name of their country
On Sunday, voters vote to change the name of their country to ‘Republic of Northern Macedonia’.
The popular referendum was organized in an attempt to resolve a pending dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour means that the country would claim on its territory and has repeatedly objected to Macedonia's applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is against the referendum on name change, has said that he will not take into account the results of the referendum.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of Saint Martin's silence, those of Harlem have difficulty
“The older people I spoke to said that there used to be a café and a church in every corner,” said Mr. Adams.
Today is neither a café nor a church to discover."
He said it's understandable that cafes have disappeared.
"People now have social contacts in a different way," he said.
‘Cafes are no longer the living room of the neighborhood, where people regularly go by.’
However, he is concerned that the proceeds of the sale of the assets of the churches will go less long than the leaders expect, ‘and sooner or later they will be back at the beginning.’
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments where the kind of people would live that would not help in the remaining refuges of the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of the people who will buy apartments in such buildings will be white,” he says, ‘which will lead to these churches being closed even more quickly, because it is unlikely that the people who move to these apartments will become members of the church community.’
Both churches were once built by a white church community, before Harlem became a black metropolis: the metropolitan community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original church community of white Methodists was left in the 1930s.
A black church congregation from nearby took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott from shopkeepers in 125th Street, an important shopping street in Harlem, where blacks could rarely get a job or be promoted.
In 1939 the building was severely damaged by fire, but when the parishioners of Reverend Johnson planned to rebuild the church, they also bought a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Reverend Johnson and his successor in Saint Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July referred in another way to the instrument: 'a cultural treasure' and 'an irreplaceable historical instrument'.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first carillon in the world ever played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Dr. Merriweather said Saint Martin's hadn't replaced him.
The events of the last months in Saint Martin's are a complicated story of architects and contractors, some hired by the laymen of the church, others by the diocese.
The council (the governing body of the parish, consisting of lay leaders) wrote in July to express its concern that the diocese would ‘calculate the costs’ to the council, although the council had not been involved in the hiring of the architects and contractors who had sent the diocese.
Some parishans complained about the lack of transparency of the diocese.
Shark hurts 13-year-olds who dive to lobster dolls in California
On Saturday, on the first day of the lobster season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy who dived to lobsters in California.
The attack took place just before 7 in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been hiding with friends on Saturday when he heard the boy cry for help. Together with some others he paddled to the boy to draw him out of the water.
Hammel said that he thought the boy was yelling at first because he had caught a lobster, but then he realized ‘that the boy was crying, ‘I'm bitten!
I'm bitten!"
His collarbone was completely open,' Hammel saw as he approached the boy.
‘I shouted that everyone had to get out of the water: ‘There is a shark in the water!’.
The boy was taken with a helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is said to be at risk of life.
It is not known which shark species is responsible for the attack.
Coast Guard Captain Larry Giles told us at a press conference that a shark had been mocked a few weeks earlier in the area, but that it had then been concluded that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured in the upper body.
The authorities closed access to Ponto Beach beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours with a view to research and safety.
Giles noted that more than 135 shark species live in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's wish to break through on the British beauty market
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and directs beauty departments in which specialized assistants work, such as in supermarkets.
The initiative is part of a strategy to conquer the British beauty market, which is worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow, while sales of fashion and household items continue to decline. The larger beauty departments are tested in 11 shops throughout the country. If they prove to be a success, they will be introduced in even more shops next year.
The investment in the beauty market is also a result of the fact that supermarkets want to fill the racks where there were ever TVs, microwaves and interior items with other products.
Sainsbury's wants to double his beauty offer and offer 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also the existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees gets more space, with per brand, as in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also brings its boutique make-up back to the market, now that most products are suitable for vegans, something that younger shoppers increasingly demand.
In addition, perfumery the Fragrance Shop will test out concessions in two shops from Sainsbury's. The first one is previously opened in Croydon, in southern London, the second one will be opened later this year in Selly Oak, in Birmingham.
As more and more people shop online and increasingly buy small quantities of food on a daily basis in local supermarkets, supermarkets need to make more effort to convince people to shop with them.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive of Sainsbury's, says that the stores will look more and more like supermarket houses, now the supermarket chain takes it up against discounters Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsburys has integrated Argos sales points into hundreds of shops and has also opened a number of Habitats since both chains were taken over two years ago. According to the company, the sales of food has increased and the acquisitions have delivered more return.
The last time the supermarket tried to give its divisions Beauty and Pharmacy a makeover, it became a flop.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but the cooperation was terminated when there was a conflict over the distribution of revenue from the pharmacy department in the supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury's 281 pharmacy departments in the shops three years ago sold for a sum of 125 million British pounds to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan, by adding an extensive range of luxuries for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed our beauty department completely, so it is more pleasant for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialised training of our employees, who will be ready to give advice.
With our offer of brands, we offer for everyone something, and thanks to the attractive environment and convenient locations, we make sure that our customers like to buy their beauty products from us, and no longer shop in the old way."
Peter Jones 'enraged' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the 11 million pound deal
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, is 'enraged' because TV-presentator Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a 11 million pound deal with his lifestyle business. She wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories.
The company of Jones and Willoughby is compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presentatrician of This Morning announced on Instagram that she is leaving.
Peter Jones van Dragons Den is furious at Holly Willoughby, because at the last moment she withdrew from their profitable lifestyle business to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was “enraged” when Willoughby announced during a difficult meeting at the headquarters of the company in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that she did not keep enough time for Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories because of her new contracts (with a value of £1.5 million).
The company is once compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and is expected to double Willoughby's fortune from an estimated 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she would leave Truly, Jones left for one of his holiday homes abroad.
One source said: ‘Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It would guarantee its future in the long term, and provide enough for the next decades.
Everyone was bluffed when she decided to withdraw.
No one could believe his ears last Tuesday, because the launch was scheduled for soon.
The warehouse of the main establishment in Marlow is full of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the presentatrice, one of the most profitable stars in Britain, could cost the company millions, as a result of the large investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear, and because the launch could now be further delayed.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been well friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly in 2016 together with Capp, and Jones, 52, became president of the company in March.
The two sets often go together on vacation and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will soon become M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of the I'm A Celebrity programme on the British channel ITV.
A source from Jones' entourage said last night: 'We have no comment on his business affairs.'
Hard language 'and then it was love between us'
He wondered about the criticism he would get in the media for a comment he made that some people would find 'unpaste for a president', and for his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump imitated a news anchor when he said,
"I didn't give up anything."
He added that Kim was interested in a second meeting. Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore a major step towards the decommissioning of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons have been under way.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in June, top diplomat Ri Yong Ho of North Korea told leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a 'corresponding reaction' by the United States after the first disarmament initiatives of North Korea.
Meanwhile, the United States continues its sanctions to keep pressure on the boiler, he says.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the election rally.
"We're doing very well in North Korea," he said.
‘We were close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim have led to positive results.The missile trials have been completed, hostageed his release and the material surpluses of American soldiers have returned to their own country.
He also defended his unusual approach to his relationship with Kim.
“It’s as easy to behave as a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to access this busy arena, there would be about 200 people standing here,” said Trump, while he was to the public before him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population no longer lived, no national disaster was announced, which is a requirement for international aid to be launched.
'Unfortunately, in many cases it is clear that they are not seeking international aid, which is difficult for us,' said Mrs Sumbung.
Save the Children is preparing a team to travel to Palu, but it is not certain that the relief workers from abroad can work on site.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Relief Agency, said that Indonesian officials were still in the process of evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to help.
Although Indonesia is constantly plagued by earthquakes, it is still very poorly prepared for the anger of nature.
In Aceh, shelters were built to hide from tsunamis, but on other coasts, these are rarely seen.
That there were no warning signs for tsunamis in Palu, although a warning was in force, probably contributed to the number of deaths.
In ideal conditions, it may be difficult to travel from one Indonesian island to another.
National disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital vessel in Lombok to deal with earthquake victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days before the ship reaches the place of the disaster.
The improvement of Indonesia's homeless infrastructure was one of the key elements of President Joko Widodo's election campaign, and he has already spent a great deal of money on roads and railways.
But President Joko's government has to deal with a shortage of funding, and that, while he hopes to be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Islamic majority are following a previously conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their homes because Christian and Islamic gangs fought on the streets, with machetes, arrows and bow and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool provides impressive equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge protected Liverpool last Saturday for loss against Chelsea in the Premier League, with a goal in the 89th minute, during a game in Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he stood at a distance of about 30 meters from the goal of Chelsea, at the time his team was left with 1-0.
He tipped left against the ball and then pushed in the direction of the farthest pole.
The ball flew high above the penalty area, in the direction of the top right corner of the grid.
He invented the leap of Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play as much as possible forward,” said Sturridge against LiverpoolFC.com.
‘I saw Kante approach and ventured an effort. I didn’t really think about it, I just kicked at the ball.’
Chelsea was at peace with 1-0, after a goal of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The head of The Blues kicked the ball with his heel to Mateo Kovacic, and then he rushed through the middlefield to Liverpool's play-helf.
Kovacic did a quick one-two in the middlefield.
After that he gave a nice stabpass, allowing Hazard to reach the penal court.
Hazard was faster than the defense and kicked the ball with his left foot past Alisson Becker of Liverpool in the net, next to the back pole.
Liverpool plays on Wednesday at 15:00 in the group phase of the Champions League against Naples, in the stadium San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea competes with Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The death toll of tsunami in Indonesia amounts to 832
The death toll of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, said the National Disaster Relief Agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people were stuck in the ruins of buildings that had collapsed as a result of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 of last Friday, with waves of 6 m high, said spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, is full of ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after wife is stabbed to death
This morning a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, after which a murder investigation was opened.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 p.m. at Grayson Mews in John Street, where the body showed stab wounds, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for suspecting murder.
The police ask local residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Police inspector Brian O'Hagan said: ‘The investigation has only just begun, but I want to ask anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and who has seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, in particular taxi drivers, to contact us if they may have filmed something via a dash cam, because they can have information that is essential for our research."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a building.
This afternoon friends who thought they knew the woman on the spot came to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have confirmed that they are currently informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to enter his apartment, but was told by the police that no one in or out of the building is allowed.
He was speechless when he found out what happened.
The residents are now told that it will take hours before they can return home.
A policeman would have told someone that the area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared crying at the scene.
She just keeps repeating, "What a shame!".
At 2:00 p.m., two police cars were inside the safe house, and a third were just outside.
Within the deposit, a number of agents were watching the apartment building.
Anyone with information is asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, to call 101 or anonymous contact with Crimestoppers on the number 0800 555 111, stating log 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue to the British Parliament is the latest victim of the 'rewriting history'-rel
The banishment of the statue would be a poetic justice for the Taliba-night destruction of the many cultural and religious art objects carried out by his fanatical puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described the suggestion of Mr. Crick as 'foolish' and 'an attempt to rewrite history.'
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the current debate on the removal of statues would lead to showing the figure of Oliver Cromwell just outside the Houses of Parliament.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
The beautiful image of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies to the opinion that prevailed in the 19th century and is part of the history of a figure that many still have to recognize.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: ‘Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether that is a completely correct picture is still being debated.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure that represents one side of that gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector must also be recognized and remembered."
Murderous pig kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwest China, according to reports in the local media.
The man, of whom only the surname ‘Yuan’ is known, was found dead at a stable on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou. His artery was pierced and he was under the blood, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares for the incubation of pigs in a pig stable on 30 May 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
On Wednesday, he was said to have left the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and turned out to be a door to a neighboring pig stable.
According to the cousin, a large male pig with blood on its mouth was found in the pig's nest.
A forensic study showed that the 250 - kg pig killed the farmer, according to the report.
‘The legs of my cousin were blooded and maimed’, said the cousin with the last name ‘Wu’, according to the newspaper Guiyang Evening News.
On images of surveillance cameras it can be seen that Yuan arrived on the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man wasn't Yuan's or his cousin's.
One market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent the others from attacking, while the police collected evidence on the spot.
The Yuan family and the market authorities are currently negotiating compensation for his death.
It happens only rarely, but there have been cases of pigs that attack people in the past.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing the man to be seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a 300 kg pig pushed a farmer out of Wales against his tractor until his wife swept the animal away.
When a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba at CBC News testified that pigs are normally not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can provoke aggression.
‘They’re just playful.
They're just kids, very curious... they're not ready to hurt people.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
The star of Hurricane Rosa brings heavy rain to the southwest of the U.S.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weak after reaching the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will bring severe rains to the north of Mexico and the southwest.
At a wind speed of 135 km per hour, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane at 5am local time on Sunday morning and 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to ascend north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough begins to form above the Pacific Ocean, which moves eastward to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, tropical humidity is pushed northward, to the southwest of the U.S.
Rosa will bring 10 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, tropical moisture that reacts with the approaching trough will cause widespread heavy rainfall in the South West in the coming days.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous floods, rain currents and possible earthquakes in the desert.
Tropical moisture will result in precipitation of 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to rain from 5 to 10 cm in parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
There are sudden floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions, as tropical rain can fall very widely.
It is strongly advised to enter the desert on foot when tropical rainfall threatens.
The heavy rainfall can engulf ravines into wild rivers, and storms will produce local windflakes and dust.
The approaching trough brings some heavy rain locally to parts of the southern California coastline.
There is rain of 1.5 cm, which could lead to small debris streams and smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall of the region in the rainy season.
Scattered tropical rains will approach Arizona on Sunday evening to Monday morning, after which the rains will be more spread at the end of the day and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread over the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue to fall until Wednesday.
In October, the temperature in the US can fluctuate strongly, because the Arctic is getting cooler, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to large differences in temperature over short distances.
There is a fine example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the U.S. on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the continuing summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
In a large part of the centre and east of the US, it is expected that October will start warm, with temperatures fluctuating around 30°C from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York it can become 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees hotter than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that the opportunity to reach mid-October is high at above average temperatures in the eastern United States.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million people watched one of the six television networks on Thursday at Brett Kavanaugh's captivating testimony, candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an assault reportedly taking place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, while broadcasters interrupted the regular programming for the surprise of Friday: an agreement arranged by Jeff Flake, senator of Arizona, to investigate the charge for a week.
Ford told the Senate Committee on Justice that she was 100% sure that a drunk Kavanaugh was captivating her and tried to strip her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh stated in a crazy testimony that he was 100% sure that this had not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen watched on Friday.
The company counted the average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures were not available immediately for the other networks that sent out the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people looking at an office.
In comparison, it's about like a playoff of a football match or for the Oscar issue.
Fox News Channel, which gives Kavanaugh all the support, had most viewers during the day of the hearing: an average of 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers, and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Even after the hearing, the public remained very interested.
Flake was the central figure of the events on Friday.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would support Kavanaugh with his voice, the cameras of CNN and CBS registered on Friday morning that protesters shouted to him when he tried to take the lift to a hearing of the Commission for Justice.
He stayed a few minutes with his eyes down while he was being insulted, live on CNN.
'I'm right here in front of you,' said one woman.
‘Do you think he tells the people the truth?
Someone shouted, "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement, and just before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more during the hearing.
The various transmitters sent everything out live when the judicial committee had to vote on the appointment of Kavanaugh in the Senate hours later.
But Flake said that he would only vote with the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominees by the following week, something that the Democrats urge the minority to do.
Among other things, Flake was convinced by his friend Chris Coons, Senator and Democrat.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several senators.
Flakes' choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'a political game' around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who were critical of her plans to leave the European Union of 'a political game' with the future of Britain and undermining national interests.
The Prime Minister of Great Britain Theresa May will attend the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, on the same front page of the paper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stressed his attack on his so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, and said that her proposal that Britain and the EU should collect charges was 'absurd'.
Shooting party Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson as suspect of LSU player's death
The police arrested a suspect for the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and in prison on suspicion of murder, said Baton Rouge's police.
The authorities posted a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses on the scene and found Simpson's DNA on the glasses, reports WAFB, a CBS television station.
The police interrogated Simpson and later declared that he had known that he had shot Wayde with death.
His deposit is fixed at $350,000, reports the Advocate.
On Friday, the city coroner in East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report stating that the cause of death is a wound to the neck.
The report states that the Fugitive Task Force of the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and local residents all contributed to the investigation that led to an arrest.
Sports director Joe Alleva of LSU thanked the local police for his ‘intervention and pursuit of justice.’
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU.
He won an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match in the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU-Basketballcoach Will Wade said that the team was 'cpot' and 'in shock' by Waydes dead.
“This is an event that you always hope will never happen,” says Wade.
Volcano spits as in Mexico City
The ashes spun out by the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after activity had been picked up in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ashes had been registered for a period of 24 hours.
The center detected multiple rumbles and vibrations.
On social media, pictures of a thin layer of ash appeared on car buses in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have seen an increase in activity in the volcano, which is located 72 kilometres southeast of the capital, which is the first time since September 2017, when an earthquake with a force of 7.1 hit the Richter Central Mexico scale.
The volcano, called 'Don Goyo', has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists on the eve of the birthday of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence activists succeeded in coping with riot police, while thousands of participants participated in rival demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the vote on independence in Catalonia, which split the region into two groups.
A group of masked pro-separatists who were stopped by the riot police bombarded the agents with eggs and powder paint, causing dark dust clouds to flare up in the streets that were usually filled with tourists.
Later on the day, the police broke out with the shields, and the cops pulled their bats over to stop the fighting.
For more than an hour, pro-independence groups sang: ‘Do not forget, do not forgive’, while their opponents cried out ‘Long live Spain’.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries they suffered during the protests, reported the local press.
The tensions continue to rise in the region of independence, one year after the referendum of 1 October, which is considered illegal by Madrid, but is celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The electors spoke out overwhelmingly to become independent, although the rise was low and the people who are against divorce were boycotts.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote in the polling offices in the region, where it resulted in violent screens.
Pro-independence groups had camped the night of Friday on Saturday on the spot to prevent a demonstration to support the national police.
The demonstration continued, but it was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who accompanied his wife with the separatist protest, said that he was no longer hopeful of the prospect of becoming independent.
‘Last year we had one of our most beautiful moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although the Catalan pro-independence parties won an essential victory in the regional elections in December, even though it was nip, it was difficult for them to build on their success this year, because many of their most famous leaders are absent, either in self-imposed exile or in captivity, pending a trial about their role in organising the referendum and proclaiming independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been sparked by politicians on both sides.
"The tensions are increasing," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in provisional detention since the end of last year, declared that he was taking part in the European Parliament elections next year.
'A candidate for European elections is the best way to complain about the decline in democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish Government,' he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after the house was framed with a car
Three men of 33, 34, and 39 years of age were arrested after a car was repeatedly framed in a Londonderry house.
The incident took place around 7.30 p.m. on Thursday in Ballynagard Crescent.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said that the gates and the building themselves had suffered damage.
At some point a crossbow may also have been fired on the car.
Livingston wins with 1-0 against Rangers thanks to Menga's goal
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston brought them the victory
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his second defeat in a series of 18 games since he was manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference and the team of Gary Holt came to be equal to Hibernian.
Gerrard's team failed this season to win a competition during the Premiership. They have to record Sunday against Leader Hearts, who has eight points ahead of them.
But first the Rangers receive Rapid Vienna Thursday in the Europa League.
Livingston's team has already won six consecutive games in his department, and Coach Holt hasn't had any defeats since he had Kenny Miler replaced last month.
Livingston lacks opportunities for strong visitors
The Holt team had long been able to achieve a lead for the first goal, because their direct way of playing caused all kinds of problems with the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but failed to finish it with a goal point, and then Alan Lithgow, who took up Craig Halkett's baseball, kicked the ball over the goal.
The home team had the Rangers play with pleasure, waiting for his opportunities to be quiet and confident.
And that eventually led to the crucial goal.
The Rangers allowed a free staircase, and Livingston provided an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create an opportunity for Menga, who scored from the penalty area.
At the time, the Rangers already had ball possession for a long time, but the defense of the home team was unmistakable and goalman Liam Kelly didn't have much to do.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos made sure that Kelly had to avoid a goal.
Scott Pittman kicked the ball at the feet of Rangers goalman Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed the goal after a proposal from his colleagues at Livingston.
Continued progress reached the penalty range of Livingston, but they were rejected each time. Twice a penalty was refused, one after Halkett's attack on Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
'Fenomic' of Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal achievement and result for Livingston.
They played without exception excellent and continue to surpass expectations in their race to the top.
Their playing style and the composition of their team has hardly changed since their return to the highest region, but especially Holt deserves much recognition for the way he has swept up the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Commander Halkett was fantastic, with an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall walked on the tops of their toes throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, did not break through.
Although they have often played very well under Gerrard, this time they did not reach their usual level.
Their final phase was not good enough (they only succeeded once in shifting the home team) and the Rangers will now realize that they have to play better. They are in the middle of the classification.
Erdogan is received with mixed feelings in Cologne
Under a glowing blue sky and with a broad smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany went to breakfast together Saturday (29 September) in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They do not agree on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan left for Cologne for the opening of a gigantic new mosque.
Cologne is the home of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called for security reasons when they prevented the crowd of 25,000 people to gather for the mosque, but many sympathizers came near to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters, many of them Kurds, also made their voice heard, condemning Erdogan's policy as well as the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
The rival protests reflect the division of a visitor praised by some German Turks as a hero and accused by others as an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: biker dies after collision with car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at about 10.15 local time.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance staff was present, but the man died on the spot.
A few months ago, another cyclist died in an accident involving a flight crime on Childers Street, about a mile [about half a kilometer] from the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said that agents were involved in identifying the man and his immediate family.
The road is closed in several places, buses are diverted and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Prison of Long Lartin: six jailers injured in violation of order
Six ciphers have been injured in an order violation in a heavily secured prison for men, according to the prison office.
The riots broke out on Sunday at about 9.30 a.m. local time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still in progress.
Specialized ‘Tornado’ cipiers have been deployed to resolve the situation, involving eight prisoners in one department.
The cipiers were treated there for minor injuries to the face.
A spokesman for the Prisoners said: ‘Specially trained prison staff have been deployed for a topical incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of staff have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and those responsible are at least referred to the police and may have to stay behind bars longer.'
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had been treated in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October the riot police were called to prison for a serious violation of order in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (with potentially positive effects on drought zones)
It rarely happens that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week, because the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa moves across the southwest of the desert area, which carries risks of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued alerts for sudden flooding for the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, and the southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to hang just above Phoenix on Tuesday. Monday evening it will rain already.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that ‘since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in the area of 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation, with isolated amounts up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the southwest of the desert area, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, will probably get 3 to 5 cm rain, and here and there is 10 cm possible.
For areas that are not at risk of flooding, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are very worrying, part of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial because the South West is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the map on which current drought areas are identified, slightly more than 40% of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category,' reported weather.com.
The route of Hurricane Rosa reaches the mainland through the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa is still on hurricane strength at a maximum wind speed of 140 km per hour, located at 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and travels north at a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm hits cooler waters in the Pacific, so it is weakened.
Therefore, it is expected to arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening with the power of a tropical storm.
There may be heavy rain in parts of Mexico, resulting in a significant risk of flooding.
“A total loss of 8 to 15 cm is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with up to 25 cm possible,” reported weather.com.
Rosa moves north over Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early mornings as a tropical depression, which will then be late on Tuesday evening through Arizona and in the south of Utah.
‘The greatest danger expected of Rosa or her tail is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest of Sonora, and the southwest of the desert area’ said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and floods in the deserts and earthquakes on mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrests on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
The teen was injured in the Excelsior Terrace district in Midsomer Norton at about 4 hours on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is 'stable'.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested in the Radstock area at night, according to the police of Avon and Somerset.
The police are asking anyone who may have filmed something about what happened to report.
Trump says that Kavanaugh 's been under the meanness, the anger' of the Democratic Party
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the ruthless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that during his appointment procedure Kavanaugh 's suffered constantly under the commonness, the anger' of the Democratic Party
Kavanaugh testified to the Congress on Thursday and denied the incitement of Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford has also testified at the hearing about her accusation.
The president said on Saturday that the ‘American people’ saw the magnificent and incredible character, the quality and the courage’ of Kavanaugh that day.
‘A voice to recognize Judge Kavanaugh is a voice that recognizes one of the most complete legal opinions of our time, a lawyer with an excellent status of service,’ he told the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of the Republican rise in the mid-term elections.
‘In five weeks, one of the most important elections takes place in our lives.
I don't participate, but I actually do participate," he said.
“That’s why I stand for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump said that the Democrats are on a mission to 'resist and hinder us'.
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place by Friday at the latest, said a top team member of the GOP leadership to CNN.
Hundreds dead by Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and the toll is increasing
At a large earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people were killed, many being wiped off the ground when gigantic waves fell on the beach, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu, when waves of about six meters high hit the ground at the time it started to shimmer. Many people fell to pieces and the waves destroyed everything on their path.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
“When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, there were still people on the beach. They did not immediately walk away and thus became the victim of the tsunami,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Indonesian Bureau for Assistance in Natural Disasters BNP during a briefing in Jakarta.
'The tsunami also led to other dangers: he dragged cars, tree trunks, houses, he hit everything on the land,' Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coastline.
Some people climbed a tree to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
On aerial photographs released by the Natural Disaster Relief Bureau is shown that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have been twisted and collapsed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was shaken by aftershocks.
The range of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released during the massive Friday earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb that had fallen on Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the city's geography, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, has further enhanced the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as ‘significant’ and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
Some deadly victims were trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said. Some 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and damage may be even greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication with Donggala ‘is completely flat, we have no information at all’, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people,” said the Red Cross in a statement. The Red Cross staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,” said the Red Cross.
The organization received much criticism on Saturday because she had not said that a tsunami had hit Palu, although employees said that the waves had reached the country within the time the warning was given.
In amateur images shared on social media, you can hear a man yelling down on the top floor of a building in panic to people on the street to warn them that a tsunami is coming.
Minutes later, a wall of water falls on the coast and buildings and cars are dragged along.
Reuters could not immediately verify the images.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power failure that cut off the communication around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue attempts.
The army is currently sending cargo planes with relief supplies from Jakarta and other cities, said authorities, but the evacuations are still in urgent need of food and other basic needs.
The city airport has only been reopened for assistance and remains closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll of tsunami rises above 800.
It's very bad.
Although World Vision employees from Donggala have arrived safely in the city of Palu, where workers in the courtyard of their office search shelters in tents of decks, but passed along scenes of destruction, said Doseba.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses that had been destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups began with the difficult task of launching emergency aid, some complained that certain foreign relief workers with great expertise could not travel to Palu.
According to the Indonesian legislation, funding, goods and staff from abroad can only be allowed if the location of a disaster is declared as a national natural disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
'It's still a provincial disaster,' said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
'When the government says, 'Okay, this is a national disaster', we can provide international assistance, but that status has still not been declared.'
When the second night after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday fell on Palu, friends and relatives of the missing ones continued to hope that they would find their loved ones their lives, as in the miracles that people so much like to hear in terrible natural disasters like this one.
On Saturday a boy was taken out of a sewer.
On Sunday, relief workers freed a woman who had spent two days under the rubble with the body of her mother next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian games, which had taken place earlier this month in Indonesia.
His students were also stuck in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandaga.
"As a veteran in the paragliding world, I bear my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon said that the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed had spread into the paragliding community and that in the hours thereafter he had sent desperate whatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
In his messages, however, only one grey spot appeared instead of two blue spots.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during ATM supply in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning stolen thieves $26,750 from a Brink employee who was filling a ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport police press release.
The driver had just emptied a ATM in the entertainment complex and wanted to fill it with money, so Professor Dennis McCarthy wrote in the message.
When he was busy, another man walked behind Brink's staff and stole a bag of money that was ready to deliver.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing, according to the press release, but the police did not say how many persons were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about the identity of the perpetrators is asked to contact Newport's police on the number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Last Saturday he announced the change to Twitter with the words: “The being that is formally known as Kanye West”.
41-year-old West has been called Ye for a short time and used this nickname as the title for his eighth album, which came out in June.
The name change was announced in the run-up to his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her performance during the show for 'emotional reasons', says the maker of the show.
You are not just an abbreviation of his present artist name. West told already that the word has a religious meaning for him.
In my opinion, ‘ye’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’, said West earlier this year, when he told about the title of his album by radio presenter Big Boy.
‘So I am you, I am us, we are.
I was transferred from Kanye, which means 'the only', to just Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is rather a reflection of who we are."
He's not the only famous rapper who changes his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Didy or Didy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who worked with West in the past, has also worked with and without the link sign and the capitals.
Mexican President promises not to use forces against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use military force against civilians. The country stands on the eve of the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would ‘never use military force to suppress the Mexican people.’
On October 2, 1968, military troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people. In that period, left student movements occurred throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that young people often become members of criminal gangs as a result of unemployment and lack of opportunities to study.
United States must double the funding of A.I.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend on researching A.I., says investor and A.I. specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for all of Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He says this following the announcements of A.I. that come from various departments of the U.S. government, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have a formal strategy for A.I.
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year: by 2030 the country wants to be number one in the field of A.I. innovations.
'To double the budget for research into A.I. would already be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the US, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in A.I.' said Lee.
A doubling of funding could lead to a doubling of the chances of the next major achievement for A.I. in the US, Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Snovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China’s most important A.I. companies.
In the 1980s he worked in Carnegie Mellon University on an A.I. system that defeated the best player in American Othello, and later he was manager of Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese Department of Google.
Lee expressed his appreciation for technology competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next competition would take place, because it would help to discover the following visionaries.
In the USA, researchers often have to work hard to get government subsidies, said Lee.
'China doesn't pick up our best academics, the companies do it', said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been recruiting the best universities to work on A.I. in recent years.
Lee said that American efforts in the field of A.I. would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
'He who is a doctor in A.I. should be offered a green card automatically', he said.
The Chinese National Council issued its artificial intelligence development plan for the next generation in July 2017.
The Chinese Foundation for Natural Sciences provides financial support to academic institutions' employees, as do the National Science Foundation and other government organisations, giving money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defence set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to involve partners from industry and the academic world in the initiative, and announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that 2 billion dollars would be invested in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing more than 100 million dollars in research into A.I.
However, US legislation that should lead to the creation of a national safety committee for artificial intelligence has been in jeopardy for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on possible change of name of their country
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change of their country’s name to ‘Republic of Northern Macedonia’, thereby resolving a dispute with Greece that has been coming to an end for decades and would no longer hinder Greece’s Macedonian application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province also called Macedonia, and says that the name of its northern neighbour means that the country claims Greek territory, so Greece vetoed Macedonia's inclusion in the European Union and NATO.
The two authorities concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalists believe that the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slav majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he is not going to vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign is not sure that the required rise of at least 50% will be achieved, so the referendum may not be valid.
The question on the ballot note is as follows: ‘Do you support NATO membership and the EU with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?’
‘Name change advocates, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, consider that the price to be paid is worth trying to become members of bodies such as the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that emerged when the former Yugoslavia disunified.
‘I am here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it will lead to a safer life for all of us,’ said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, sufficient Members have indicated that they will respect the outcome, which will determine it.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament would be required for the change of name.
The National Election Commission said that there had been no reports of irregularities at 13 o'clock.
However, the rise was only 16% at that time, compared with 34% in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of the registered voters came to vote.
‘I’m coming to vote because it’s important to my children. Our place is in Europe, said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, an electorate in the capital of Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, during the referendum on the change of name of the country that would open the way for NATO and the European Union membership.
For Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and set up chairs for tents that were placed by people who boycotted the referendum.
“We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as a full member, not through a back door,” said Kavadarkov.
‘We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that membership of NATO will result in necessary investments for Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
'I am convinced that the vast majority are in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,' said Zaev after his vote.
He said that a 'yes' as a result would be 'a confirmation of our future'.
An opinion poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required rise.
Another survey, conducted by hot Macedonian TV station Telma TV, concluded that 57 percent of the respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of that, 70% would vote yes.
If the referendum is to be successful, then the rise must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-western government's policy since it came into power in May last year.
Look at: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City Passes Full Defense of Brighton and Scort
Last Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made short mats with the defense of Brighton at Etihad Stadium in English Manchester. Manchester City won the match with 2–0.
It looked like a whistle of a cent, how Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine summit was first played in the middle field.
He raced through between three Brighton defenders, straight into the open field.
There Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He was able to pass a defender and was also too quick for some others on the edge of Brighton's penal territory.
Then he gave a passport to the left, where Sterling was waiting.
The English attacker used his first action in the penalty area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right shoe to defeat targetman Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right-hand side of the net.
“Aguero has problems with his feet,” said Coach Pep Guardiola of Manchester City to the press.
‘We decided to let him play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time."
But it was Sterling that gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he was in the playfield of Brighton.
He sent a beautiful ski pass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball and sent Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues player just tapped the ball in, just before he was too far.
City will compete against Hoffenheim in the group phase of the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55. The competition will take place in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play along and it doesn't make the Rockies easy to reach the play-off
Now that the Washington Nationals have been eliminated for the play-off, there was little reason to force a new start.
However, the always competitive Scherzer hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are any consequences to the participation of the Rockies in the playoff. They currently stand for one game at the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least obtained a game card for the play-off thanks to their 5-2 victory against the Nationals last Friday, but they still want to do everything to secure their first section title.
‘Although there is nothing left for us, we can at least tickle with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver will be optimal with this audience and the other team probably plays at the highest level that I would meet this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play in that?"
The Nationals still have to announce who will be on Sunday, but are said to be inclined to set Scherzer as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, stood in the injection field on Thursday and would still pitch next Sunday, although that is normal his rest day.
The right-handed pitcher from Washington stands on 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump organized a meeting in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court, while he spoke about the importance of the Republican rise in the mid-term elections.
‘Everything we have accomplished is at stake in November.
In five weeks, one of the most important elections takes place in our lives.
This is one of the really big elections. I don't participate, but I actually do participate. That's why I stand for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued: ‘We see a terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, we see it happening now.
And they are determined to take power back, no matter what they need to do for it.
It doesn't matter who hurts them, who they have to push away to gain power and control. That's what they want: power and control, but we won't give them that."
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to 'resist and hinder us'.
'And we've seen that in the last four days,' he said, calling the Democrats 'bossed and mean and false and lying'.
He named the Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, who sits in the Senate Committee on Justice, which led to loud appeals from the public.
‘Do you remember what she said?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for one... that was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
The party is intolerant to people who say what they think
When the activists of Momentum voted in my local party to censor me, that was no surprise.
Finally, I am the latest in a whole series of Labour Members who were told that we were not welcome, just because we were saying what we were thinking.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because she resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was punished by the censorship motion because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, issues similar to those of Jeremy's earlier leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday announced: "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
And that was the case during most GC meetings on Friday evening during the eight years that I have already been locally Labour Member.
Unfortunately, today that is not the tone of many meetings and has forgotten the promise of a 'kinderer, softer' policy for a long time, if she had already started.
It is becoming increasingly clear that a dissenting opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and any opinion is assessed on whether it is acceptable to the Party leadership or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader. Colleagues who, as far as I knew, had a similar political view as I did, suddenly expected me to reverse and take a position that I would otherwise never have agreed with, from subjects such as national security to the European single market.
Every time I speak to a public, whatever I say, there are social media abuses calling for my candidacy to be rejected as a Member of Parliament for the next elections, exposing the politics of the centre and telling me that I should not be a member of Labour.
And that's just what I'm going through.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments to my address are generally political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who daily deal with a flood of sexist or racist reactions, but do not let themselves be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that very bad parties are apparently considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church, and with every ‘motion of distrust’ or change of selection rules the party becomes more petty.
For the past two years, I have often been advised to keep myself down, not to speak loudly, and then I would ‘don’t get into trouble’.
But before that, I didn't go into politics.
Since I became a member of Labour 32 years ago as a school child, provoked by the neglect of the government of Thatcher, which literally collapsed my classroom, I have always argued for better public services for those who need it most, both in my role as councillor and in my role as minister.
I have never kept my politics hidden, nor in the last elections.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clarity about my policy positions and my disagreements with the current leadership.
I can only say one thing to those who have promoted the motion on Friday: when the country drags on to a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact I have only one message, which is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that threats to reject my candidacy as a Member of Parliament for the next elections or political opportunities will not prevent me from acting according to what I think is in your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr unbeaten on the way to the top
Two late try's may have pulled the end result somewhat crooked, but there is no doubt that Ayr triumphs quite rightly in this wonderful day's contest in the Tennent's Premiership.
They're now at the top of the class, the only unbeatable team of the ten.
Eventually it was both their superior defense and their better chances of winning the home team, and coach Peter Murchie was allowed to be satisfied.
“We’ve had a lot of trouble so far during our competitions and we’re still unbeated, so I’m a happy man,” he said.
Robyn Christie van Melrose: ‘All honor to Ayr, they have taken advantage of their opportunities better than we have.’
Grant Anderson's strike in the 14th minute, completed by Frazier Climo, led to a lead for Ayr, but by a yellow card by Rory Hughes of the Scottish national team (which he got during the Warriors competition), Melrose was able to speak the numbers and Jason Baggot succeeded in breaking down a plot.
With a penalty, Climo created an extra advantage for Ayr and scored a conversion after a solotry just for the rest. So it became 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, followed by a conversion of Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
The competition was silent for a long time before a serious injury from Ruaridh Knott, which was carried out on a Brancard, and as soon as the game was relaunched, Ayr was able to continue to run through a plot of Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion of Climo.
Then Commander Blair Macpherson got a yellow card from Ayr, and again counted Melrose with the extra man when no conversion followed a trick by Bruce Colvine at the end of a game where the pressure was very high.
The home team came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he tackled Climo without the ball, MacPherson took care of a touch-down at the penny-line-out behind the uplifting Ayr-maul.
Climo took care of the conversion, and did so almost immediately after the restart again, after Kyle Rowe took the box kick from David Armstrong up and halfback Gregor Henry sent away for the fifth try of the home team.
Star of Still Game is ready for new career in the restaurant world
It looks like actor Ford Kieran from Still Game is going to the restaurant. Apparently he is appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he acts together with his comedy partner Greg Hemphil.
The duo announced that the next 9th series will be the last in the series, and it seems that Klüben is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official data, he is the director of Astridmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the story, but a source from the Scottish Sun seemed to think that Kijen was looking for a way to participate in the ‘flowering restaurant business’ in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': Bolivia's country-encouraged hope that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific Ocean
Zeelui patrol in a serviced marina in La Paz.
An ocean blue flag waders on public buildings.
On all the seabases from the Titicacamera to the Amazon, the motto is: ‘The sea is ours.
It's a duty to win them back."
Throughout the country-encircled Bolivia, the reminder of the coastline that the country had to give up to Chile after a bloody nineteenth century raw materials conflict is still alive, just like the desire to preserve the Pacific once again.
That hope may have reached its highest point in the last few decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice, which should be held on 1 October after five years of discussion.
‘Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and naturally looks forward to the result’, said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians throughout the country will look at the ruling of the Court of First Instance on large screens, hoping that the Hague Tribunal will plead in favour of Bolivia that, after decades of pitiful talks, Chile is obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who stands next year for a controversial struggle for re-election, is also at stake with Monday's verdict.
"We are very close to the return to the Pacific," he swore at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will probably not decide in favour of Bolivia, and even if it did, there would be little change.
The UN body established in the Netherlands does not have the power to designate the Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
According to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law, the judgment of the International Court of Justice falls only six months after the final objection.
And the prospects for a positive result from Bolivia have certainly not improved, on the contrary, over the last four years the situation may have gotten worse.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian government," said Zárate.
The warlike rhetoric of Morales has all the good will that Chile might have had completely undermined, she claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks at a certain time, but it will be extremely difficult to talk about this afterwards.
The two countries have not had an ambassador in each other's country since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, denies that the court's decision has been taken unusually quickly.
On Monday Bolivia will have ‘an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of international relations with Chile’ and an opportunity to ‘make an end to 139 years of disagreements, with mutual benefits’ he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
‘Bolivia will never give up his right of access to the Pacific,’ he added.
‘The verdict is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind us.’
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the US
The North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs Ri Yong Ho says that his country will never remove its nuclear weapons if Washington cannot trust it.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to comply with the promises made during a summit between the leaders of the rivals in Singapore.
He said this at the time that State Secretary Mike Pompeo was about to start the ongoing nuclear diplomacy again, more than three months after the Singapore Summit with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri says it is a "utopia" that the ongoing sanctions and the American objection to a declaration ending the Korean war will ever get on the knees of North Korea.
Washington is not inclined to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang taking important steps in the area of disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit meeting.
But there is skepticism and there is doubt that Pyongyang is serious when he says that he would refrain from an arsenal that the country probably sees as its only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collection of huge head covers, soon to be sold to you nearby
If you want to expand your hat collection or keep the sun completely out of your eyes, do not continue searching.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a series of crazy oversized headgear for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, a striking move during the Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats were this summer not to think away from Instagram and these designers have sent their eye-blinding creations to the catwalk.
The striking piece of Valentino was a gigantic beige hat decorated with a feathery wide edge, which hung over the eyes of the models.
Other oversized accessories were watermelons occupied with gemstones, a magic hat and even a pineapple, but they were not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
With many of the colorful masks the lips were sewn tight. They looked more on Hannibal Lecter than on haute couture.
One creation looked like diving gear, complete with snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow this bold fashion, you are lucky.
Stylewatchers predict that the huge hats will find their way to the clothing stores near you.
The giant hats may be inspired by 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-metre-wide edge that everyone wears, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that appeared everywhere on social media also provided another great creation on the catwalk: a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the model in bathing suit that the bag carried.
The roodoranje raffia bag, cut off with raffia fringes and finished with a white leather pendant, was the most striking piece in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus during Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMIIL: 'I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the shops next summer. Since the designer has made such an impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for extra large accessories.'
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
The independent schools in Scotland have an excellent position in the field of academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with a new series of excellent exam results, as well as individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other initiatives of the entire community.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their pupils for further and higher education, their chosen career and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a custom-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain popular and desirable subjects especially within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, you reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and a relationship of trust with people from other countries.
From the recent test results of this year, we can conclude that languages are at the top of the ranking, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a high score.
Data collected from 74 schools in SCIS show that 72 percent of the students achieved a high score ("A") in Mandarin, while 72 percent of the students in German, 69 percent of the students in French and 63 percent of the students in Spanish also achieved an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Languages are now valued as expertly as STEM subjects (science, technology, technology and mathematics) in independent school programmes and elsewhere.
According to employers, a UK Employment and Skills Commission investigation in 2014 showed that 17% of the obstacles to filling out job vacancies were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Language skills are thus becoming increasingly important to prepare young people for their future career.
Now that more and more job vacancies require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career that a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with such a skill for life.
Communicating directly with people from abroad automatically gives a multilingual person an advantage over competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation. French was the only language that surpassed the 10% peak, with a total of 15%.
This is the reason why investing in language education is now important to the children of today.
Several languages can speak, especially those of emerging economies, offering children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, schools themselves choose which languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that are most important to the United Kingdom when they look ahead to 2020, such as the Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interest of your child, there will always be different languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers specialising in this area.
Scottish independent schools work to provide a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills needed to succeed, regardless of the future.
At present, it cannot be denied that languages in a global business environment remain vital for the future of the country, so this needs to be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be regarded as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes his debut on Sunday at the Lakers in San Diego
Fans waiting for LeBron James' first match at the Los Angeles Lakers, waiting is almost over.
Lakers-coach Luke Walton announced that James will be playing in the opening competition before the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
We still have to figure out how many minutes he'll play.
“There will be more than one, and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a tweet that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After the training earlier this week, James was asked for his plans for the Lakers' schedule for the six races prior to the season.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need competitions before the season to prepare me,” he said.
Period of election rally of Trump in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, on a long series of election rallyes
It is the first of five planned rallys of Trump in the coming week, including stops in places that he is fond of, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote on the appointment of the candidate he chooses for the post office in the Supreme Court has been held, Trump wants to build up support for the upcoming mid-term elections, because the Republicans risk losing control of the Congress when voting in November.
What time does the Trump rally start tonight in West Virginia and how do you watch online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, starts tonight, Saturday September 29th, 2018, at 19pm.
You can view Trumps rally in West Virginia online via the live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably be talking about the hearings for candidate Supreme Judge Brett Kavanaugh of this week. These were extra loads as Kavanaugh is accused of sexual misconduct and the Senate may wait a week to vote on his appointment, while the FBI is investigating the case.
But the main objective of this series of rallyes is to help the Republicans who are candidates for the November elections to get more elan.
President Trump's campaign leader said that these five rallyes in the next week are intended to 'stimulate volunteers and supporters, while Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Deputies', Reuters says.
‘Control of Congress is so important to his program that the president travels to as many states as possible as the busy campaign season begins’, said a spokesman for the Trump campaign who did not want to be mentioned on behalf of Reuters.
Tonight's rally at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be discussed in Pittsburgh's media, said West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state that he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who remains in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to give him a boost in the scouts,” said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is willing to fight to keep the hope alive in the run-up to the singles of Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, maybe the foursomes of Saturday afternoon were just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The fluctuating sling of opportunities is a fully invented sports concept, but one that players really believe in, and especially in competitions like this one.
So who gets the best chances at the moment?
'They had a six-point lead first, and now that's only four more, so we find so little that happiness is at our side at the moment,' said Jordan Spieth before he left at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage of standing in front of four points, while twelve are still in play.
The Americans find, as Spieth said, that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that give courage, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and each three points of the four have scored.
Spieth has been a fearful opponent from tea to green and he gives the good example.
The typical throat sounds he makes when he plays well became louder as his round progressed and he achieved a crucial well with which competition four became a success when he and Thomas were behind two points after two games.
His well with which she won the competition on 15 was followed by a similar scream, the kind from which you can deduce that he believes that the American team is not yet defeated.
'You have to dig deep and worry only about your own game' said Spieth.
That's all these players can do now.
18 holes to print your stamp.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
This remarkable, but wonderful European duo has four in four and can do nothing wrong.
'Moliwood' was the only duo that played no bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the back nine on Friday morning, they avoided bogey's.
As a result of that series, and the way they seem to exchange energy with their noisy audiences, they are the players who have to be defeated on Sunday. If Fleetwood or Molinari wins, he will ever be the most popular player who wins a European victory when the sun sets above Le Golf National.
Preferably both at different holes at the same time.
However, it is premature to speak of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short mats with Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of that morning, when he formed a duo with Alex Noren.
A bowey and two doubles on the front nine led to a retardation for the Spaniard and the Swede that they could no longer overcome.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help to catch up with you.
The four-balls and foursomes are so fascinating to see through the interactions between the duos, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way a strategy can change at an glance.
The European team has already played its best and has a good lead in the run-up to the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that Team USA is willing to face the battle, something some people, especially in the USA, have challenged.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts with a nice lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup. After the four-balls and foursomes of Saturday, they stand with 10-6 on the United States.
The failed duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team with two victories more than Tiger Woods, who had difficulty making it possible for them to have four points ahead in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to get back the trophy she lost two years ago in Hazeltine, was stronger than the blaming Americans in the four-balls in the morning, with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, where it won two games, but could no longer catch up with his backlog.
Jim Furik's team has to score eight points during the 12 singles races of Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who got the nickname 'Molliwood', after a sensational weekend but the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup, win four points in their four opening matches.
After entering the four-balls, Woods and Patrick Reed were beautifully played together and defeated a disappointing Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5/4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two competitions on Saturday, occasionally showed a brilliant move, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-balls and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, equipped for the four-balls of the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and together they defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three of the world, with 2/41.
Yet it was not a leash roof for Europe on this pleasant day with a breeze south-west of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who already won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans on Saturday with three points.
They won after a difficult match with 2–1 by the Spanish Jon Rahman and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4/3 in the foursomes, after losing the first four holes.
It has only happened twice before in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has been able to catch up with four points at the beginning of the singles, although the team of Furik has enough to match, as they currently have the trophy in hand.
But as they have been in second place for two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems too high.
North Korea says it will 'in no case' disarm unilaterally without confidence
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that the constant sanctions would lead to increasing distrust in the United States and that under such circumstances the country could in no case give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN Annual General Assembly that in recent years North Korea had taken 'important goodwill measures', such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the location for nuclear tests and the promise not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
“But we do not see a corresponding US response,” he said.
'Without any confidence in the USA, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will by no means unilaterally disarm ourselves.'
Although Ri repeated the known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a 'phased' approach to denuclearisation, in which North Korea would be rewarded as the further steps take, it occurred that he did not reject unilateral denuclearisation as a priori, as Pyongyang used to do.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the very first summit between an active American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work towards the ‘denucification of the Korean peninsula’, while Trump promised guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea is aiming for a formal end to the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed appeals to ease international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists on 'denomination first' and increases the pressure by means of sanctions to reach its goal in a compelling way and even by objecting to the 'explanation of the end of war', Ri said.
‘The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an air castle of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the constant sanctions only strengthen our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit meeting between Kim and Trump, something the American leader did raise earlier in the week with the United Nations.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months and added: ‘If the other party were not the US and the South Korea declarant, the declarantisation of the Korean peninsula would not have been such an impasse.’
However, the tone of Ri's speech was considerably different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean missiles would be directed to the mainland of the United States so that after 'Mr Evil President' Trump Kim called a 'raketman' on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to destroy North Korea completely last year, praised Kim this year with the United Nations for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much still needs to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea denucles.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time schedule for this: 'Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, that doesn't matter.'
China and Russia consider that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: 'The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue vigorously and resolutely until we have achieved the complete, final, verified democracy.'
Since 2006, the Security Council has implemented unanimous sanctions against North Korea to substantially reduce funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo had a meeting with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was not going well.
Nearly a few hours after leaving Pyongyang in July and saying that progress had been made, North Korea accused him of setting 'walking star demands'.
North Korea promised this month at a meeting with Moon to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States were to take 'similar measures'.
He said that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore, and steps towards normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on the importance of adequate rest
A new course at Harvard University this year ensures that all students get more sleep, in an effort to combat the growing macho culture in which it seems cool to study all night and drink lots of caffeine.
A professor noted that the students of the world's largest university often have no idea of the basic principles of caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, prepared the course. As far as he knows, this is unique in the U.S.
He got the idea to start the course after he gave a talk about the influence of lack of learning.
'At the end of my speech, a girl came to me and said, 'Why can't I just hear this in my last year?'
She said no one ever told her how important sleep is, what surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
The course, which is organised for the first time this year, explains to the students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance and how they also promote their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the health services of the university, said the university decided to organize the course when it was established that students had a serious sleep shortage during the week.
The course takes one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the parts, the students see a picture of a dormitory, where they click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise machines and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light and the way sports performance is influenced by sleep deprivation, and the importance of a routine when going to sleep.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
With the help of a campus map, with interactive icons, participants are encouraged to think about their daily routine.
‘We know that this will not change the conduct of the students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know all of this, just as people have the right to know what the choice of cigarettes has for their health, added Czeisler.
He says that studying the culture of fidelity on a night's day still exists, and because of modern technology and increasing pressure on students, sleep deprivation is an ever-increasing problem.
To ensure sufficient sleep, of good quality, the student's 'secret weapon' must be to combat stress, fatigue and fear, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, because sleep shortages cause the brain to give them a constant sense of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from Calfornia who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to set up the course. He had taken lessons last year with the professor when he studied at Harvard in his first year.
He said that the course had opened its eyes and inspired him to make the course available to everyone on campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a similar study program before they come to the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set an alarm for their bedtime, and not only an alarm to stand up. They must also be aware of the harmful effects of the 'blue light' of electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt circadian rhythm, making it difficult for you to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal is to destroy Gerrard's men
The Rangers saw their competition again disappointing when Dolly Menga scored and the weak team of Steven Gerrard defeated 1-0 in Livingston.
The team of Ibrox hoped for a first victory in a competition since they defeated St Johnstone with 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt's team defeated almost the second of Gerrard as manager in 18 games. His team now has eight points left on Hearts, which continue to run out at the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before the rest, and the Rangers failed to score the equalizer.
The Rangers now dropped to the sixth place, Livingston rises to the third, with only a difference in number of goals compared to Hibernian.
And the Rangers could have more problems, since border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after apparently an object was thrown to him by the visitor team's supporters.
Gerrard made eight changes to his team. They crossed Ayr and went to the half finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt stayed at the same eleventh place for Livingston, which the Hearts knew to cut off a point last week. He would have been thrilled by the way his well-trained team managed to block the opponents at each move.
The Rangers may have had most ball possession, but Livingston did more.
They had to score after two minutes, when Menga gave the ball for the first time and Scott Pittman had the goal of Allan McGregor in the violin, but the middle field couldn't finish it.
A deep free staircase of Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his fellow defender Alan Lithgow kicked against the rear pole.
The Rangers did manage to take control, but they seemed to hope for a good outcome rather than that they really believed in it if they could approach the goal.
Alfredo Morelos found at least that he was entitled to a penalty when he and Steven Lawless collided after 15 minutes, but referee Steven Thomson waved away the request of the Colombian.
The Rangers were only able to shoot at the target twice in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who was formerly a target at the Ibrox, could easily stop the ball of Lassana Coulibaly and the tame shot of Ovie Ejaria.
The opener of Livingston in the 34th minute should not be in the extension of the general game, no one can deny that they deserved this, even though it was only for their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers were not against Jacob's deep game pattern.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher handed over the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cold-blooded and chose Menga, who pushed the ball into the target with ease.
Gerrard had a break with the Coulibaly/Ryan Kent exchange. This move had almost immediate consequences when the wing player passed Morelos, but an impressive Kelly raced off his line to stop the ball.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play the kind of game that Livingston prefers, where Lithgow and Halkett continue to kick long balls.
The Holt team could have increased its lead in the final phase of the game, but McGregor held a good stand and blocked Jacobs, after which Lithgow came wide from the corner.
Invadeer Glenn Middleton of the Rangers asked at the end of the game for a referee after an attack with Jacobs, but Thomson again looked the other way.
Almanak: inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from the almanac of our Sunday Morning: 30 September 1882, today exactly 136 years ago, for whom TELLEN can well ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm ‘Hans’ Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device named Geiger counter.
The gypsy counter has since not been thought out of science, and has also become an icon in pop culture, for example in 'Bells or Coronado', a 1950 film with the first sight unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: 'What the hell is that?'
Rogers: ‘That’s a geiger counter, which is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you set up this headphone, you will hear the effect of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: 'It's really banging now!'
‘Hans' Geiger died in 1945, almost a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears its name remains relevant.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ and kill malignant cells
Vaccine learns immune system to recognise malignant cells in treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells in a patient to change them in a laboratory.
They can then “see” a protein that often occurs in many types of cancer and are then re-injected.
A test vaccine provides promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognise malignant cells saw her ovary disappear for more than 18 months
In the method, immune cells are removed in a patient, after which the cells in the lab are adjusted in such a way that they can ‘see’ the protein HER2, which is often present in all types of cancer, and the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a highly promising vaccine."
HER2 ‘stimulates the growth of different types of cancer’, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and intestinal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar way to remove immune cells from patients and to ‘learn’ these cells to treat cancer cells was already shown to be effective in treating a particular type of leukaemia.
Kanye West cuts off pro-Trump-tirade and wears MAGA-pet after his appearance in Saturday Night Live.
It wasn't as he had hoped.
Kanye West was released during a broadcast of Saturday Night Live after an incoherent performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said that he became a presidential candidate in 2020.
After bringing his third song of the evening, Ghost Town, with a hat on his head with the text Make America Great Again, he threw off a tirade against the Democrats and repeated that he supports Trump.
“Many times when I’m talking to a white person, she asks, ‘How can you be sympathetic to Trump? He’s a racist!’
If I was worried about racism, I'd already been out of America for a long time,' he said.
The broadcast of Saturday Night Live began with a parody in which Hollywood star Matt Damon stuck the dragon with the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate Committee on Justice in connection with the alleged assault that Christine Blasey Ford accuses him.
West's tirade was not broadcast, but comedy Chris Rock uploaded it to social media.
It's not clear if Rock with his mail wants to stick the dragon with West.
West also complained to the audience that he had been taken backstage under fire for his hat.
‘They have trodden me backstage.
They said, "Don't step on stage with that hat."
They teased me!
And then they say I'm apathetic," he said according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: ‘Do you want to see how apathetic it looks?’ He said that he would attract them superman-cape, ‘because that means you can’t order me. Do you want the world to get better?
Give me some love."
From the public at least twice the appeal came and the cast members of SNL seemed embarrassed, according to Variety. The magazine was told by an audience: 'The whole studio was suddenly silent.'
West was a last-minute substitute for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-friend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with a performance of the song I Love it while he was dressed as Perrier bottle.
West received the support of the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: ‘To one of our bravest spirits: APPROVED THAT YOU THE MASSA TROTSEERT.’
But talk show-presentary Karen Hunter tweet that West was just ‘usual itself, and that's beautiful.'
‘But I choose not to reward someone who supports and spits out an ideology that harms my community (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his ‘art’).
He's free to do whatever he wants.
We too, added them.
Before the show began the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name. From now on he is, he says, ‘the being that is formally known as Kanye West’.
He's not the first artist to change his name, he was led by Didy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Collega-rapper Snoop Dogg also has the name Snoop Lion and the music legend Prince once changed his name into a symbol and then in The artist formally known as Prince.
Indictment of attempted murder after stinging at restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed on Friday in a restaurant in eastern Belfast.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, said the police.
The defendant is expected to appear on Monday before the judge in Belfast.
The accusation will be investigated by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington exclaims toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role of sword fighter Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones of HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor gets to the macho hero's stereotype and says that young boys often think when watching such roles on the screen they have to be tough to get respect.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he thought that ‘there was something wrong’ and asked himself how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his co-star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31 years old, admitted that he is strongly convinced that the problem needs to be addressed.
'This is really an important question for me at the moment: where did our masculinity go wrong?' he said.
"What did we learn from men when they grew up, so that we are now faced with this problem?"
Kit thinks that television might be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity, due to its very masculine characters.
He continued, "What is born and what is taught?"
What is learned on TV and on the street that makes young boys think they have to be a certain kind of man?
I think that is one of today's big questions: how do we change that?
For something has clearly gone wrong for young men."
In the interview he also admitted that he will not act in prequels or sequels of Games of Thrones when the series is over next summer, because he is ‘ready with battlefields and horses’.
Since November, Kit will be playing in a revival of True West by Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is an attacker.
The actor recently revealed that he finds his encounter with his wife Rose is the most beautiful result of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife during the series, so that way I left my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygrite, the great love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that was crowned with an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslies family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% new cases
China reports that the number of Chinese with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health authorities say that more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
Only 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
In the vast majority of new cases, the diseases were transmitted via sex, which was previously not the case.
HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through transfusions of contaminated blood in the past.
But the number of people who are growing HIV in this way is now almost zero, said Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, compared to the same period last year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
The transfer of HIV via sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has been no longer punishable in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be widespread.
According to studies, the conservative values of the country estimated that between 70 and 90% of men having sex with men would eventually marry a woman.
Often the diseases are transmitted by inadequate protection in sexual relations in these relationships.
The Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication since 2003 in the context of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff member has leaked data from Republican senators and extracts from 'dangerous lies' and 'complot theories'
The U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters opposes the accusations made by one of her staff staff members that put the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia page of the legislators.
The Democrat from Los Angeles claims that the allegations are spread by 'extremely right' contentions and websites.
'Lues, lies and even more nasty lies', Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published data would include the private address and private phone number of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The data appeared on Thursday online. They were posted by an unknown person in Capitol Hill at a hearing of the Senate Committee on the allegations of sexual misconduct at the address of Brett Kavanaugh, candidate judge of the Supreme Court.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, the IP address indicating the source of the posts was linked to the Waters office and contained the information of a Waters employee, said the Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie," said Waters.
‘My employee, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false accusations, was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie."
The Waters statement has already arrived quickly at criticism online, including by former press officer of the White House Ari Fleischer.
'This denial sounds angry', wrote Fleischer.
‘You can learn from this that she does not have the temperament to be Congressman.
If someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he shouldn't be angry.
He's not to be rebelled.
He should not question the prosecutor's motives.
He must remain calm and serene."
Fleischer appeared to compare the response of Waters with the criticism of the Democrats on Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of excessive anger at the hearing of Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take Waters' place in the mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very, if it's true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed the relevant services and law enforcement authorities of these false allegations.
'We shall ensure that the perpetrators become known,' she said, 'and that they are legally liable for all their actions which are destructive and dangerous to my staff.'
Review: Johnny English Strikes Again - weak spider parody with Rowan Atkinson
In each new British-based film we are now traditionally looking for references to the Brexit, and that does prove to apply to this revival of the Johnny English franchise, the comic action films with a weak spy in the lead role, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was launched back in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is this airy selfish about how bad we are doing the latest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English with plucking eyes and flexible facial features manages at least to send everything in the hundred, also with his second comeback. From his name you can conclude that he is a common comic character that was conceived for cinemagoers in countries where one speaks a different language than English.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to smooth glamour, a little Clouseau, a little Mr. Bean and a touch of that guy who contributed one note to the theme number of Chariots or Fire at the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
He is originally based on the traveler and the international mystery man who Atkinson once played in the TV spots of Barclaycard (which everyone has forgotten) who always leaves behind a certain chaos.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two beautiful moments.
I loved the way Johnny English approaches a helicopter in his medieval armor and the rotor blades tick against his helmet.
Atkinson can show well in this film how much talent he has for physical comedy, but the humor comes rather weak over and crazy enough, especially now the "serious" series of movies like 007 and Mission Impossible itself include comedy as an ingredient, and that does well.
The humor seems to be intended for children rather than adults, and Johnny English's stupid disaster comes to me less original and focused than the jokes without the text of the character Bean that Atkinson plays.
The constant theme is now that Britain is in great difficulty.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super-secret spy network on the web, making the identity of all active secret agents from Britain known to great dismay of the agent in function, a sad little role of Kevin Eldon.
That is the drop that makes the bucket overflow by the prime minister, a pretentious woman with problems to her head and terribly unpopular as a politician. Emma Thompson does her utmost to remember this character that reminds Teresa May, but the script does not offer much material to work with.
According to her intelligence advisers, she must use a retired spy, since each active spy is compromised.
And that means the Stuttering Johnny English himself, who now works as a school master in a fancy institution, but gives unofficial lessons about undercover work. Here are fun jokes in the story, because the spy angels of English are thinking of school or rock.
English is quickly denied at Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former pathetic help Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man. His wife is captain of a submarine, a rough and jovial role that lies below Vicki Pepperdine’s level.
The Batman and Robin of the disastrous conditions of Her Majesty's Secret Service are thus back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's bloody femme fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, unfortunately, the Prime Minister is in favour of the charms of charismatic technology billionaires who claim to be able to solve British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start with their odyssey of clumsy fun: dressed as a waiter, they set fire to a glamorous French restaurant, they cheer on board the luxury yacht of Volta and English unleashes pure anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
For that last one, all the registers are opened, but no matter how well-meaning and turbulent the scene is, she does some thinking about children's television.
It's all not very original.
And like the other films by Johnny English, I wonder: can the British film industry really not think of a role that honors the talent of Rowan Atkinson?
Labour denies that the party is thinking of a plan in which British people work four days a week but are paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party would consider a radical plan in which British workers work four days a week but get paid for five days.
It is said that the party would want companies to pass on the savings they make as a result of the revolution of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) to their employees by giving them an extra day holiday.
For example, employees can enjoy a weekend of three days, but still earn the same amount.
According to sources, the idea in the party's economic agenda and the plans to make the country's balance sheet shift towards the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week has already been approved by the Trade Union of Trade Unions, which finds it a good way to ensure that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A high source from the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: ‘A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not happen from one moment to another, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits within the party's ambition to make the balance in the economy more favourable to workers and that also fits within the party's overall industrial strategy."
Labour is not the first party to support such an idea, given that the Green Party has already promised a four-day work week in the 2017 national election campaign.
However, the efforts are not yet supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesperson said: "A four-day working week is not a party's policy plan and is not considered by the party either."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used Labour last week's conference to make his vision clear on a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of the 'secular drivers' and the 'profits' of utilities.
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not regain the full value of their share, because a Labour government could apply 'shorts' on the basis of perceived misconduct.
He also confirmed that there are plans to include employees in the boards of corporate governance and to set up inclusive ownership funds (Inclusive Ownership Funds) to give 10% of the shares of private sector companies to employees who can earn up to £500 per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh can change their mind
The investigation by the FBI into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question whether the findings of the FBI could ensure that Republican senators withdraw their support for the candidate.
In an interview broadcasted on Sunday at '60 Minutes', early correspondent Scott Pelley to Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham or the FBI could discover something that could lead to a change of opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said for the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened after the charge came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was resolute, determined, unambiguous."
Graham's voice, however, appears to be wall-resistant.
"My opinion on Brett Kavanaugh is firm and the accusation should contain dynamite," he said.
"As for Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett has strongly denied it," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one named by her could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I do not see any new developments."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday the Global Citizen Festival will be organised in New York, an annual music event where a very impressive line-up to stars will take place and which has an equally impressive mission: the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh time, tens of thousands of people will come to the Great Lawn in Central Park for the Global Citizen Festival. Not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to generate awareness for the real purpose: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first organised in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international stakeholders hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
Concert walkers who want to obtain a free ticket for the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP card), had to complete a series of tasks, or 'actions', such as volunteering, a world leader e-mailing, a phone call or in another significant way generate awareness for the purpose: an end to poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been, with another 12 years to go to achieve this goal?
Is it the idea to reward people with a free concert an appropriate way to convince people to demand action or is this just another form of 'clicktivism', people feel that they are making a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded over 19 million 'actions' from supporters, which were aimed at a large number of different goals.
According to Global Citizen, these actions have contributed to the efforts of world leaders and have made policy proposals worth more than $37 billion to change the lives of 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the Group quoted 390 initiatives and statements on the basis of the actions, of which at least 10 billion dollars have already been paid out or brought together by sponsorship actions.
The group estimates that the funds obtained have so far had an impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
One of the most important declarations of intent is that of The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executives from the United Kingdom with the aim of 'helping children realise their full potential'. This group has pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the British government, donors, other national authorities and Global Citizens like you, we can make a footnote to history to the social injustice that is malnutrition," said Tracey Ullman, ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, the public at a London concert in April 2018.
The group also announced that, after more than 5,000 actions were sent asking the UK government to improve the food situation for mothers and children, the government announced to support a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with food interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the Global Citizen website, which was asked "why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
said the group: "It will be a long and difficult way, sometimes falling and failing.
But, like civil rights and anti-separity movements before us, we will ultimately succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are a few of the artists that will be performing this year at the event in New York presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use the Navy for a 'blockade' to prevent Russian exports of energy - Minister of Home Affairs
Washington may 'if necessary' take refuge in the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, Ryan Zinke, the U.S. Secretary of State for Home Affairs, as mentioned by the Washington Examiner.
Zinc claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, where the country acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that they are only in the Middle East to be able to act in energy, as in Eastern Europe and the southern flank of Europe," he said, according to the report.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to counter this.
"The United States has this possibility, with the Navy, to ensure that the shipping routes remain open and, if necessary, to block them in order to ensure that their energy does not enter the market," he said.
Zinc spoke for those invited during an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without profit that deflects itself as the 'vote of energy consumption' in the U.S.
He went on and compared Washington's approach to Russia with Iran's approach and noted that these did not differ significantly.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less the use and replacement of fuels," he said, referring to Russia as a country that only knows an 'art', with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the government of Trump is trying to encourage the export of liquid natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a country that offers the cheapest option for European consumers.
For this reason, officials of the government of Trump, including President Donald Trump himself, try to convince Germany to withdraw its view from the 'inappropriate' pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trom van Berlin, has made the 'captive' of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth 11 billion dollars, will double its current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is simply an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition to the project is only driven by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we agree with the view that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers themselves," said Aleksandr Novak, Russian Minister for Energy, after a meeting with Rick Perry, US Secretary of Energy, in Moscow in September.
The US position has prompted Germany to react, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), the leading industrial organisation in Germany, has called on the US not to interfere with the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third power is involved in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI) after a recent meeting between the German chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "thinks seriously after" to participate in the presidential elections in 2020, says the Senator for Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, the Senator from Massachusetts, said on Saturday that she was "serious about thinking about it" to take part in the presidential elections after the mid-term elections.
At a local meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking about participating in the elections.
"It is time for women to go to Washington to restore the damaged government, and this also means that a woman in the top position," she said according to the political newsmagazine The Hill.
"After November 6th, I'll think seriously about making myself elected president."
Warren fought against President Donald Trump during the meeting in the town hall and said that he "strips this country in the wrong direction".
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy," she said.
Warren has been frank in her criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we have to wait for the FBI to investigate before we vote on this."
However, an opinion poll published on Thursday revealed that a majority of Warren's own support felt that it should not be elected by 2020.
Thirty-eight percent of the 'probable' voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not vote, according to an opinion poll of the Political Research Center of Suffolk University and the Boston Globe.
Thirty - two percent were for her to make an election.
The study showed that there was more support for former Governor Deval Patrick, 38% before a possible candidacy and 48% against.
Other names of leading Democrats associated with possible participation in the presidential elections in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator from Vermont.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin talks about PTSS from Track Palin at a Donald Trump election meeting
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after taking up service in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"By what my own son has to experience, what he is going through when he is back, I understand other families who are experiencing the consequences of PTSS and the injuries with which some of our soldiers return," she told the audience who was present at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about her son and other veterans "they come back a little differently, they come back and get harder, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and the pilots and all the other soldiers have given for the homeland".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and was charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, interference in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence, according to Dan Bennett, police spokesman in Wasilla.
Washington D.C. and 18 states support the protest against a new asylum policy
Eighty states and the District of Columbia support a legal protest against a new U.S. policy which refuses asylum to victims who are on the run for violence from gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and Washington D.C. presented a statement last Friday as a friend-of-the-court to the Washington court in support of an asylum seeker who contests this policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace versus Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union submitted in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She says that her partner "and his violent sons who are members of a gang" have abused her but that American officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She's under arrest in Texas.
The lawyers of the states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of people apply for asylum in the U.S., as countries who have major problems in terms of gangs and domestic violence.
The US's new asylum policy has reversed a decision of the Board of Immigrant Appeals in 2014, which made it possible for immigrants without documents who are on the run for domestic violence to ask for asylum.
Karl Racine, the attorney general of Washington D.C., said on Friday in a statement that the new policy is "for decades ignoring state, federal and international legislation".
"Federal legislation requires that all applications for asylum be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such an obstacle is contrary to that principle" is stated in the "Friend of the Court".
The lawyers further argue that the policy of denying immigrants access to the US harms the economy of the US, because these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and the country 'provides the necessary workforce'.
In June, Jeff Sessions, the Minister of Justice, ordered judges no longer to grant asylum to victims of domestic and gang-related violence.
"Asial is available to those who flee their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political belief," says Sessions in his announcement of 11 June of the policy.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems, even if these problems are serious, with which people get to do all over the world every day.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu while the number of deaths doubled in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was also getting worse.
"It feels very tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while trying to comfort her feverish baby in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute new bodies arrive in ambulances.
And clean water is scarce".
Residents returned to their ruined homes and searched in their coves for valuable goods they could still use.
Hundreds of people have suffered injury and the hospitals are overpopulated, as far as they are not damaged by the earthquake of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
Some wounded, including Dwi Haris who had a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the army hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside because of the risk of severe post-shocks.
Tears filled his eyes when he told of his feelings when the devastating earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed against the remnants of a wall," Haris told an Associated Press correspondent and added when he was with his family in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, and later I heard nothing more.
I don't know what happened to her and our child.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of 'intimidation' with 'propaganda ads'
One week after an official Chinese newspaper placed an advertisement of four pages in an American daily, in which the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China were promoted, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
American President Donald Trump referred last to the paid annex of China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of interference in the U.S. Congress elections of 6 November, an accusation denied by China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere with the U.S. elections marked, according to American officials quoted by Reuters, a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to put China under pressure.
Although it is normal for foreign authorities to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war, where they have imposed ever higher import rates on each other.
China's early trade war retaliation rates were specifically aimed at meeting exporters in states like Iowa, who support the Republican Party of Trump, as Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, an important exporter of agricultural products to China, said that China had hit American employees, farmers and businesses.
"China", as Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in Des Moines Register of Sunday, "is now doubling the harassment by publishing propaganda advertisements in our free press".
"By spreading this propaganda, the government of China uses the freedom of expression and of a free press, a long cherished tradition in America by placing a paid advertisement in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at a kiosk in the centre of Beijing you will find in vain different voices and you will not see any true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people have on the difficult economic path, because the media are firmly under the thumbs of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers refused to publish his article", as he did not say in which newspaper this was.
By the Kavanaugh-debacle, the Republicans alienated female voters just before the mid-term elections, warn analysts
Now many important Republicans around Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, and defending him against various accusations of sexual violence, warn analysts that they will suffer a setback, especially among women, during the forthcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions on this subject have been enormous and most Republicans have already indicated that they wish to continue voting.
"These things cannot be reversed," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, to The Hill for an article that appeared on Saturday.
Reeher said he was wondering if the attempt of Senator Jeff Flake (Republice, Arizona) to plead for an FBI investigation at the last moment would be enough to satisfy the evil voters.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday, they haven't forgotten tomorrow and they haven't forgotten it in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and country spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday according to the newsmagazine from Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators cried out "November is coming!" during their demonstration in the Senate's hall, while the Republicans who controlled the Justice Committee chose to approve Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation for the Democrats will reach a record height," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, on the news site.
"People say it's already high, and that's true.
But it can continue to happen, especially among floating female voters in the suburbs and among younger voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who often do not vote even if they do not agree with the President".
Even for the public witness of Ford, in which she further explained her accusation of sexual harassment against the candidate before the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that there could be a setback if the Republicans were to press the appointment.
"This has become a confused mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican Party, earlier last week according to NBC News.
"It is not just about the vote in committee, or about the final vote or that Kavanaugh is taking place in court, but also about the way the Republicans dealt with this and how they dealt with it," says Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats to be elected, clearly on the news channel.
The Americans, however, appear to be divided over the question of who they believe after the witnesses of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority representing the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of the respondents believe in Ford's testimony, whether or not it is likely, and that 35 percent believe in Kavanaugh.
Moreover, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh was sure or probably lying during his testimony while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's move, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported this to The Guardian.
Ford announced last week to the Senate Justice Committee under oath that Kavanaugh had assaulted her under the influence of alcohol when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court has shown his genitalia to her at a party in the time they both studied at Yale in the 80s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans a new internet to tackle Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of the technology legend, is a company based on the open source platform Solid of Berners-Lee.
Solid offers users the possibility to choose where their data are stored and which people have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee dug that 'world domination' is the leading idea behind inrupt.
"We have to do this now," he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to enable people to make their own 'personal online data storage' or POD.
Lists of contact persons, activity lists, an agenda, a music library and other personal and professional tools can be stored in it.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together via one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is the fact that it depends entirely on the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this 'personal empowerment through data'.
The idea behind Inrupt is according to CEO John Bruce that the company provides the resources, processes and necessary skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can make their own decentralised apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not going to engage with "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete transformation that will put all their business models on their heads at once".
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post on Medium that was published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the "mission (of Inrupt) is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new web, which is built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even after the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: spiritual and carrier of the Victoria Cross from WW I honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England who acquired a Victoria Cross during the First World War is honored as a military in his birthplace 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel, Father Bernard Vann received the distinction following the attack on September 29, 1918 by Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper, so he never knew that the highest British military honor had fallen to him.
A memorial stone was revealed by his two grandsons during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilly symbolic" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the fact that his grandfather was distinguished.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion on September 29, 1918 over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense fog and under heavy fire from combat rifles and machine guns".
Later he rushed to the fire line and led the line forward before he only ran to a field shelter and turned three members of the strike off.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German shooter on October 4, 1918, slightly more than one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never type in, but also something that makes me feel humble."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a cliff after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "felt very venerated to play a role in the parade" and added that "the bravery of a real hero is evident from the support he receives from a large number of people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine, you stayed up all night watching a full-bodied Bellator 206 and you won't see the most important moment.
The San Jose bill contained 13 battles, including six in the main section, and this was broadcast all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., right when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald got ready for their fight, viewers in the United Kingdom were surprised when the transmitter switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were indignant because they had stayed up all night especially for this fight.
One fan described the transition to the children's program on Twitter as "a bad joke".
"According to the government regulations, after 6:00 a.m., no more content should be shown that is not suitable for children, and that is why we had to switch to the children's program," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president for marketing and communication at Bellator, when he was asked for the broadcast.
""Peppa the pig," yesss."
Scott Coker, CEO of Bellator, said that they are going to adapt their programming to ensure that viewers in the United Kingdom will also have a chance in the future.
"I think, with a view to the rematch, we can solve this problem," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning here on a Sunday and we can't discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the switch, a lot of texting went back and forth and believed me, these weren't all as friendly.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that, it was a government problem.
I can promise this will not happen a second time.
We limit the broadcasts to five nights instead of six, as we normally did, we tried to make it even better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferiority' because of his sexual nature
The Olympic jumper Tom Daley says that during his youth he felt inferior because of his sexual nature, but that this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The twenty-four said that until he went to secondary school, he didn't realize that 'not everyone is like me'.
In a conversation at Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Lavorne he said that he had spoken about gay rights to give others 'hope'.
He also said that the parent had contributed to the fact that he had less value for winning during the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the long-term show has taken a few months off because of illness.
Apparently as a shift on Laverne's first program, Daley said that he felt less during his youth than others because it was 'socially not accepted to like both girls and boys'.
He said, "To this day are those feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different, really existing facts that have given me the strength to be successful."
He wanted to prove that he was 'someone', so he wouldn't disappoint people if they eventually found out his nature.
The winner of two bronze Olympic medals has become a prominent campaigner for the LGBT community and used his presence at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call on more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said that he spoke out because he was happy that he could live openly without further consequences and that he wanted to give others 'hope'.
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, whom he met in 2013, 'has completely surprised me'.
Last year, Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, but said that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you have to stand so young," he participated in his first Olympic Games at the age of fourteen and his father died of cancer three years later, it is difficult to find someone in your own age group who has experienced the same highs and lows.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me this question last year, I would have answered that it was all about winning a gold medal," he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning gold Olympic medals.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he had been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last things he had asked if she had already received the tickets for London in 2012, because he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't get it about my heart to say, you won't be there to sit on the first row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and not until his breathing really stuck and he died, I could finally admit that he was not invincible," he said.

"I knew I had dreamed about this all my life. To dive for a home audience during the Olympic Games, there is no better feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first choice of music, Proud by Heather Small, that had attacked him heavily on the way to the games and that he still got chicken skin from.
Desert Island Discs is listening on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in form, at the bank during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will establish a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match in the Ryder Cup, but he must see his form back to make no sad milestone.
Mickelson, who participates in the biennial event for the 12th time, a record, was placed on the bank by the team captain Jim Furik for the foursomes and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors divides the day between supporting his teammates and exercising on the driving range, in an attempt to find out where it is suspended.
Because he was never even on the peak of his career known for his straight drives, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the narrow fairways of Le Golf National, where the long grass defys the roughs wandering balls routinely punishes.
And if the job itself is not terrifying enough, Mickelson will come in the ninth match on Sunday the always Accurate Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, against which is linked to newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who are behind four points at the start of the 12 single matches start well, the Mickelson match can be absolutely crucial.
Fury has made it appear to have confidence in this man, although, frankly, he could be difficult different.
"He totally understood the role he had today, slapped my back, knocked his arm around me and said he was ready tomorrow," said Fury.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is included in the Hall of Fame and he has contributed so much to these teams, in the past, but also this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I expected more, but it's the way it is and it's the way we've been supposed to act.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson can improve Nick Faldo's record for the highest number of Rider Cup matches played on Sunday.
It can also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he has never quite matched the highlights of his personal career.
Mikkelson has won 18 matches, 20 lost matches and 7 equal games on his name stand, but Furyk said that his presence had a certain incredible influence on the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's caught, he likes to make jokes with people, and he's a great guy to have in the team," he explained.
"I think the younger players liked to fool him from time to time last week, that was funny to see.
He has so much more to offer than just his game."
Thomas Bjorn, European team captain, knows that big advantage can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the comfortable advantage before the single matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a less comfortable situation.
The Danish made his debut in the race in Valderrama in 1997, where the team with captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead on the Americans, but eventually the finish line passed with the smallest possible margin: 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just," Bjorn, called here, after seeing the 2018 lights win with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, good for a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
So history shows me and everyone else on the team that this isn't a game yet.
Everyone will have to make full use of it tomorrow.
Get to work and implement the plan on the right one.
It's not over until the points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that is this trophy winning, and we must continue to focus on that.
I keep saying it, I focus on the 12 players we can have, but we are also aware of the people on the other side, some of the best players in the world."
Rejoiced at the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never be ahead of business in this area.
Tomorrow another challenge awaits.
Tomorrow, individual performances will be discussed, and that is a very different discipline.
It's great to be out there running with a partner when it's okay, but when you're alone, your capabilities as a golfer are only really tested.
That's the message you need to tell the players, try to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So now let your partner go and he must also get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform better individually than as partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who conquered three of the four points.
Fury himself has experience with both sides of this kind of turnaround on the last day, as a member of the winning team in Brookline and as a loser when Europe realized the 'Miracle of Medinah'.
"I remember every damn word of that talk," he said in answer to the question how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had picked up his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important matches for the bow tomorrow, but let's try well to start, like in Brookline, or like in Medinah.
When we have the momentum, there will be a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We have adjusted our line-up to this and send the men on their way in the order that we think is best and, you know, we're going to try something out of the high hat to magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the counteroffensive and puts Rory McIlroy in for the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahman, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the first half of the battle order.
"I have chosen this group in this order, because I think we are so constantly covered," said Bjorn of his selection of single players.
The new warship of Germany again postponed
The latest frigate of the German Navy should have come into service in 2014 to replace the obsolete warships of the Cold War, but it will take at least one year before it is ready, due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the 'Rheinland-Pfalz', the leading ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates, is now postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit that a military spokesman quotes.
The vessel should have been part of the Navy in 2014, but the worrying problems after delivery have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that ordered the Navy in 2007 serve to replace the outdated frigates of the Bremen class.
As far as we know, they have a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and a form of stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic characteristics.
Other important features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to insert the latest frigates together for up to two years, away from home ports.
The constant delays, however, mean that the advanced warships, which are intended to allow Germany to project its power overseas, are already outdated by the time they are put into service, notes Die Zeit.
The fatal frigate F125 took the newspaper heads last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
There is little known of the reasons behind this return, but German media quoted a number of crucial 'software and hardware defects' that would make the warship useless if it were deployed in a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important because the vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are served by a crew of about 120 sailors, half the manpower on the frigates of the older Bremen class.
It was also made clear that the ship is suffering from severe obesity, which will reduce its performance and limit its ability to perform further upgrades.
The 'Rheinland-Pfalz' weighs 7,000 tons, twice as much as ships of a similar class used by the Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price tag for the full project, including the training of the crew, also becomes a problem.
It is said that this has reached a staggering €3.1 billion compared to the original €2.2 billion.
The problems that the newest frigates have in their grip are becoming particularly important because of recent warnings that the power of the German Navy is diminishing.
Earlier this year Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliamentary Defence Committee, acknowledged that the marine actually has "a shortage of deployable ships".
The official said that the problem over time has grown as a snowball because old ships were taken out of business but no replacement vessels were delivered.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were yet available for admission to the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
New research carried out on a farm in the highlands of Scotland is trying to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
The hope is that the findings will give new light to the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will contribute to future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland follows the common and small dwarf bat, the brown large-winged mouse and the water bat at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed at key locations around the estate to monitor the activities of bats throughout the season.
Employees of the NTS and volunteers will also carry out mobile research using hand detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bat's cries and what kind of thing does.
Next, a map of the habitat and a report is produced to provide a detailed picture on the landscape scale of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes that the results show which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of pastures and how we can best maintain forests for bats and similar species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the rest of the UK have decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect sleeping places and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightning may also pose a risk, as do fly traps and certain chemical treatments for building materials and house cat attacks.
Bats are not really blind.
By their night hunting habits, however, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use an advanced echo location technique to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight path.
In the NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares ashore in the country, bats are taken very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts who regularly investigate, perform sleep site inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even set up the first and only reservation for bats in Scotland at the Threeave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten kinds of bats in Scotland live.
Landscape manager David Thompson says that the estate is the ideal territory for bats.
"Here in Threave we have a great environment for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many very old trees and the right habitat.
But there is so much about bats not yet known and therefore the work we do here and at other locations will help us to understand better what they need to be able to thrive."
It emphasises the importance of monitoring bats before maintenance operations are carried out, since the possible unconscious destruction of a place of sleep could lead to the death of 400 female bats and their boy, possibly eliminating a full local population.
Bats are a protected animal species and it is illegal to kill them, to attack them or to disturb them or to destroy their sleeping accommodations.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, has asked the public to make a contribution to helping.
She said, "We still need to learn a lot about our bats and many of our species we just don't know how to deal with their populations."
Ronaldo rejects charges of assault while his lawyers are preparing to prosecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo charges of assault qualified as 'fake news' and said that people want to 'promote themselves' by using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel, in which the allegations have been published.
The summit of Portugal and Juventus is accused of the assault of an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is also accused of paying her $375,000 to shut up about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Through a video for his 142 million followers on Instagram Live called Ronaldo, 33, a few hours after the charges were reported, the reports 'fake news'.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today, fake news," says the winner of five Golden Balls on camera.
"They want to promote themselves by calling my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by calling my name, but that's part of the subject.
I'm a happy man, and by and by and by," the footballer added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a trial in which they want to prosecute Der Spiegel for the allegations they called 'an unacceptable reporting of suspicions in the field of privacy', according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, lawyer, said that the footballer wants compensation for the 'moral damage to an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years'.
The alleged incident occurred reportedly in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga, according to the report, went back to the footballer's room where, according to the accusation, he raped her anal, as can be seen in the charge filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and that he told her that he was a '99 percent' good guy, but that he is sometimes abandoned that 'one percent'.
The papers state that Ronaldo confirms that the couple had sex, but that this was mutually acceptable.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that her injuries were taken in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an extrajudicial arrangement because she was 'afraid of the consequences' and because she was concerned about the 'public humiliation'.
The 34-year-old now says she wants the scheme to be declared invalid because she has been permanently traumatised by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to go from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault and this summer he left for the Italian giant Juventus in a deal worth € 100 million.
Brexit: the United Kingdom will 'will have eternal regrets' as car manufacturers leave
The United Kingdom 'will regret it forever' if it loses its status as world leader in car production after Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was 'careful' that Toyota UK had said against the BBC that if Britain were to leave the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily shut down production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of border delays in the case of a no-deal Brexit jobs would cost.
Last year, the company in Burnaston, where the Auris and Avensis are made from Toyota, produced almost 150,000 cars, of which 90% was exported to other countries in the European Union.
"My vision is that if Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of March, we will see production falling in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other automotive products in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed their fears about the consequences of leaving the EU without agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already indicated that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Most of the car manufacturers are concerned about risks in the supply chain in the case of a 'no-deal Brexit'.
The production line of Toyota runs on the basis of the 'just-in-time' principle, whereby every 37 minutes parts arrive at suppliers in the UK and in the EU for cars made on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there may be a disturbance at the boundaries that the industry believes can lead to delays and component shortages.
Toyota cannot store more than one day in stock at the Derbyshire plant, so the company let it know, and in that case the production would be stopped.
Clark said theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU was 'exactly tailored to avoid border controls'.
"We must have a deal. We want the best deal, which will not only enable us to continue the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he told the listeners of the BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other producers, is that we must be able to carry on with these very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but warned in the longer term that the additional costs would affect the company's competitiveness and that this would eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and who is a representative of the trade union Unite at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs are lost, they will never come back.
A public spokesman said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump and Rosenstein's encounter can be delayed again, says the White House
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can be postponed 'for another week' while the fight about the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian influence of the elections, links between Trump's assistants and Russia and possible obstruction of the President's trial.
The question whether Trump is going to fire the Deputy Attorney-General and thus jeopardize Mueller's independence has been going on for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and to dismiss the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, rumors made the round that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the time with the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said that he 'did not like to fire Rosenstein', but then the meeting was moved to avoid a conflict with a hearing of the Senate's Justice Committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, would both testify.
On Friday, Trump gave the FBI orders to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week, which delayed the vote in the entire Senate.
On Sunday, Sarah Sanders, the press director of Trump, appeared on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "There is no date yet, it could be this week, but it could also be postponed for a week, considering all other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I always want to keep the press informed."
Some reporters had difficulty with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the shortage of press conferences was not caused by a reluctance of the 'wonderful' TV journalists, though, she added: "I will not deny that they are trying to attract attention."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President is doing more questions and answers than any president for him," she said, without proving this, "we've looked at the figures."
Press conferences are still going to take place, said Sanders, but "if the press has the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, that is infinitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to do that a lot and you've seen us do that a lot over the last few weeks and that'll take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or during press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with only the President are rare.
In New York this week the president demonstrated why, he made a frank and bizarre appearance to the collected reporters.
Minister of Health writes a letter about Brexit to NHS Scotland workers from other EU countries
The Minister for Health has written a letter to the EU staff working in NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and wish that they continue to work with the NHS after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter with less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish authorities have already declared their readiness to bear the costs of applying for a permanent status for EU citizens working for the decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU continued, and this autumn the expected decisions will be taken.
At the same time, however, the UK government has also increased the preparations for a possible scenario in which no deal is reached.
I know these uncertain times must be for all of you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of all the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the NHS and provide benefits to patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we would like you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes an emergency operation after having suffered a head injury
The linemaker of the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, underwent an emergency operation yesterday after he suffered a head injury in the 31-27 lost match against the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of the Tennessee.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the accident took place shortly in peace.
"He came to the sideline and fell more or less there," said Reed.
The trainers and the medical staff gave Abercrombie direct oxygen on the sideline, before they put him on a stretcher and took him along for further research.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come from the operating room at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are still no details known about the type/size of injury and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury has occurred.
Abercrombie, a 'redshirt sophomore', is in his first season with Tennessee State after a transfer of Illinois.
He was cobbled a total of five times on Saturday before leaving the field, making it a total of 18 times this season.

The Ministry of Finance expects this to raise £ 120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher empty when they buy a house in the UK and the extra revenue is used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's success, which attracts young voters with promises to provide more affordable homes and to tell this to polygamists.
The increase in the emptys is levied on persons and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the additional revenue being added in an attempt by the government to combat homeless people.
The surcharge, which comes on top of the present empty space, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second houses and houses purchased for the rental, may amount to up to three percent.
In this way, the Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to £ 120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of new construction in London is purchased by people who do not live in the UK. This increases prices and makes it difficult for starters to get a foot on the house ladder.
Many prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become virtually 'spook cities' because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the country.
This new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson had argued for a reduction of the emptys to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping prices high by buying up land and not using it, and he called May to abolish quotas on affordable houses to restore the 'household shame' in Britain.
Corbyn has announced a remarkable series of housing reforms, including rental ceilings and an end to expulsion 'without negligence'.
He also wants to give local authorities more opportunities to build new houses.
May said, "Last year, I said that I wanted to spend my time as prime minister on the recovery of the British Dream, that life is getting better for every new generation.
And that means that our defective housing market must be restored.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build a life.
However, it cannot be as easy for people who do not live in the UK and for foreign companies to buy homes here as it is for hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of having a home has ever become too vague a dream and the humiliation of life without a roof over the head has become too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is Scotland's management"
Jack Ross, the boss of Sunderland, says it's his "ultimate ambition" to ever become a manager of Scotland.
The Schot, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the club from the northeast of England, which is currently third in League One, on three points of the first place.
He went to the Stadium of Light last summer after returning to the Scottish Premiership in the previous season.
"As a footballer, I wanted to play for my homeland.
But I was selected for the B-team and that was the vote off," Ross told Sports Sound on BBC Scotland.
"When I was a child, I often saw playing in Hampden Park with my father Scotland and it's something that keeps attracting me.
But that possibility would only come if I was successful in managing a club."
The predecessors of Ross as managers of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says that he was not intimidated to become the successor of these established names at a big club, he had previously refused advances from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Successes for me are being measured by 'Can I have this club returned to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities of this club, it should undoubtedly be in the Premier League," he says.
"It's not a simple task to achieve this, but I can only see myself as successful when I bring the club back there."
Ross is only three years working on his career as manager, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the coaching group of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa to recover from graduation to the third division and transformed St Mirren from the edge of graduation to winning the Championship in the next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career as a footballer at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a crossroads," he remembered the moment he took the lead at Alloa.
"I really believed that management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds bizarre, because I did the best I could, I deserved fairly well and knew a few reasonable highlights.
But football can be heavy.
There's a lot of things you're faced with every week.
I still have that, considering the stress and pressure of the subject, but management just feels good.
I always wanted to be a manager, and now that I'm real, I'm as good in my skin as I've never felt in my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, revealed research
The summer heat wave has increased the income of British pubs who have difficulty surviving, but has also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups of pubs and bars saw sales rising by 2.7 per cent in July, but the revenue in restaurants was 4.8 per cent less, showing the figures.
Peter Martin, of the CGA Business Advisory Office, which collected the figures, said: "Continuous sunshine and the fact that England was more than expected to participate in the world championships, meant that July showed a similar pattern than in June, when pubs had 2.8% more turnover, with the difference that the restaurants were getting even harder.
The 1.8% fall in the turnover of restaurants in June only got worse in July.
Pubs and bars aimed at selling drinks performed well, with better LFL growth (like for-like) than restaurants going down.
Pubs that are also aimed at selling food members also of the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurants.
Looks like people just went out to drink.
In pubs and bars under management, drinking sales were 6.6% higher for the month, while food sales were 3% lower."
Paul Newman of RSM, analysts for the leisure and hospitality industry, said: "These results have continued the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of important social or sporting events remain the main factors for turnover in the exit market.
It is therefore no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, even though a 4.8% annual turnover is particularly painful given the constant cost pressure.
For food-oriented operators, the long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time and only the time will learn whether the more moderate temperatures of August can provide the necessary response."
Total sales growth in the pub and restaurant sector, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the decline in the introduction of new brands.
In the Coffer Peach Tracker, the sales monitor for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK, the performance data are collected and analysed by 47 operational groups, with a combined turnover of £9 billion. This is the established benchmark of the industry.
One in five children has a secret account for social media, which they keep hidden from their parents
One in five children, some not over 11 years old, has a secret account for social media, which they keep hidden from parents and teachers, reveals a survey
Survey of 20,000 students from secondary schools revealed the growth in 'false Insta pages'
This news has heightened the fear that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of the students say they have a 'main account' that they also show their parents
One in five children, some not over 11 years old, makes accounts for social media that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students from secondary schools revealed rapid growth in the 'false Insta accounts', a reference to Instagram, the site for sharing photos.
This news has heightened the fear that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of the students say they use a clean 'main account' that they show their parents, while they also have personal accounts.
A mother who happened to be on the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenager there who asked others to 'rap' her.
The research, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and HMC (Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference) of independent schools, found that 40% of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles and that half of them gave up personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said, "It is alarming that so many teenagers are attracted to create online spaces where they are not found by their parents and teachers."
Eilidh Doyle becomes the 'voice of the athlete' in the Scottish Council for athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of the Scottish athletics world, as non-executive director at the general annual meeting of the Management Board.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on the job and in the field and President Ian Beattie described her election as a great opportunity for the drivers of the sport to learn from her extensive experience at an international level over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys a lot of respect in the athletic community of Scotland, the UK and the world and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from her election in the council," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I am happy to be able to serve as a voice for the athletes, and I hope that I can make a contribution and help run the sport in Scotland."
The American who won the 200 meters and the 400 meters during the 1996 Games in Atlanta, two of his four gold Olympic medals, and who now regularly comments on the BBC, could no longer walk after a TIA.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that only the time will learn if I will recover and to what extent.
It has been a terrible job, but I have now fully recovered, I have learned to walk again and do my flexibility exercises again today!
Thank you for all your support!"
Advice for breast pump in which mothers are compared with cows, divides online opinion
A company that makes breast pumps has distributed the online opinion with an ad in which nursing mothers are compared to cows that are milked.
To mark the introduction of what is called 'the most quiet portable breast pump in the world', Elvie, a consumer technology manufacturer, has released an ironic, music video inspired advertisement to illustrate the freedom this new pump has to offer to sparkling mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn on a song that contains lyrics like: 'Yes, I'm milking myself, but you can't see anything about it' and 'In case you didn't notice it, these aren't udders, these are my breasts'.
The chorus continues with: "Pumping, pumping, pumping, I feed the babies, pumping, pumping, pumping, I milk the lady's."
However, the advertisement, which was published on the company's Facebook page, has directly ensured an online controversy.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and has provoked hundreds of comments, especially mixed reactions from viewers, in which many people say that the dairy industry's 'herrorism' is condoned.
"A bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must be expected to grow milk, but in their case the babies are taken away within a few days of childbirth" is written in a comment.
The breast pump of Elvie fits discreetly in a nutritious condition (Elvie/Mother).
Someone else said, "This is of course traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another person added: "This ad is so far from reality."
Others defended the ad, and a woman admitted that she found the song 'hilarious'.
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I'd get one if I were still breast-feeding.
That pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little weird, but I haven't been looking too much for it.
This is a genius product," someone wrote.
Someone else had the following comment: "This is a funny ad, aimed at moms who are choking (often in the workplace or in a toilet) and then feel like being just 'koeen'.
This advertisement does not appear to be positive or negative about the dairy industry."
At the end of the video you will see the group of women who are all dancing with the pump discreetly hidden in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women who are choking sometimes feel just cows.
The Elvie Pump, however, is completely quiet, has no wires or hoses and fits discreetly into a nutritious environment, so women have the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they are on bats.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother says: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a tough and provocative introduction.
By comparing sparkling mothers with dairy cows, we wanted to place the coal and the associated challenges in the spotlights and at the same time show in an entertaining and understandable way how the new pump will provide an incredible sense of freedom.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump gets the front page.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on Marta Jakubowski's catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly move to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of imprisoned migrant children has reached peaks, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and harsh policy introduced by the Trump government makes it more difficult to bring children to sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants and are afraid of their own chance to remain at risk in the country by registering for a child.
That risk has increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their household should print their fingerprints and that these data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified to the Congress that his organization has arrested dozens of people who have signed up as sponsors of unaccompanied minors.
The organization later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"Almost 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or family members of the sponsors are illegal in this country and a large part of them are criminals.
We're persecuting these people," said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to speed up the processing of children, officials have introduced new rules, making some of them obliged within one month of the start of detention, to appear before the court, instead of within 60 days, which was previously the standard, according to the staff at the shelter
Many of them will stand for the court, rather than in person, through a video conference to advocate their application for legal status for an immigration judge.
Those considered not to be eligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
The longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which could lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to the staff at the shelter and according to reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Advocates said that these concerns are stronger at a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where the signs that a child struggles are more often ignored because of the size of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare for it emotionally or to say good-bye to friends can contribute to the trauma many of them are struggling with.
Syria commands the immediate withdrawal of the US, France and Turkey's occupying forces
In a speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Mr Walid Al-Muallem also called on Syrian refugees to return, even now that the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also vice-president, said that foreign troops are illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that 'this will be dealt with accordingly'.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the House.
According to Moualem, the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been displaced and displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue with "this sacred struggle until we freed all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and from "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly engaged in training and counseling the Kurdish troops and the Syrian Arabs fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
With regard to refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are favourable for their return and he begs 'to spread irrational fears in some Western countries', leaving most refugees away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They are politicizing a case that should only be a humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be available for Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major bulwark of the rebels, has created the opportunity to start political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has turned away a large-scale attack from Russia-supported Syrian troops in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that this agreement knew 'clear deadlines' and said that he hoped that the military action would focus on jihadists, including fighters from the Nusa Front linked to Al-Qaeda, which are 'will be exterminated'.
Staffan de Mistura, the UN representative, hopes to convene the first meeting of a new committee of government and opposition to draft a constitution for Syria after the war and to pave the way for elections.
Moualem made clear what the Syrian Government's terms of participation in the committee and said that the work of the panel should be limited 'to review the articles of the current constitution' and he warned against interference from outside.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Period
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would win the elections in 2020 unless, as many 'liberal' viewers are likely to hope, his presidency is prematurely terminated by a settlement procedure and scandals.
In what no doubt would be 'the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever'.
At the moment, however, there are no signs of glare.
Since 2014, the viewing figures during prime-time at CNN have more than doubled to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during 'prime-time', compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and MSNBC's 'The Rachel Maddow Show' is at the top of the reviews for cable programs with 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
"This is a fire that attracts people, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the responsible behind the ABC drama 'Designated Survivor', a series about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitool.
Nell Scovell, an experienced writer of comedy and author of 'Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club' has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston for the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
Why?
"He said then, 'Because he's making me laugh'," Scovell told me.
There's entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike all the others on TV, the storylines coming from Washington can influence the future of Roe v. Wade or determine whether immigrant families can reunite or influence the status of the world economy.
Disabling is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being a well-informed citizen, when you get to know that you've been looking at a panel of experts discussing the use of sources from the 'deep background' by Bob Woodward in his book 'Fear', which is about the jack of peacock leather by Paul Manafort that has cost $15,000 ('a garment full of overconfidence' according to The Washington Post) and discussing the implications of the colorful description by Stormy Daniels of the, uh, anatomy of Trump.
I'll never be able to look at Super Mario the same way.
"What he does to give you the idea that it is a reality show is partly that he stops you something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the maker of 'Pawn Stars', about the rotating role-sharing of the Trump show and the daily plot-changes (a fight going on with the N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss a episode or you have the idea that you're walking behind.
When I reached Fleiss earlier this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat inside watching MSNBC as he picked up CNN.
He could not get off the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh who had to appear before the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember doing all those weird shows, not that long ago, and that people said 'this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now it turns out they were right."

Money from outside flows in the most exciting interim elections for the House of Deputies
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania sees an influx of money, thanks to a reorganization of a constituency which requires two sitting people’s representatives to fight for the same seat.
The newly relocated district of Pittsburg meets Democratic People's Representative Conor Lamb, who acquired his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb must take it up against another sitting national representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, who knows a lot about the new 17th district.
The maps were reclassified after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held in January that the old districts had been unconstitutionally classified ('ferrymandering') for the benefit of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a fighting party in the area of campaign financing between the financial arms of the two major parties, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republical Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a well-considered special election for the 18th constituency of Pennsylvania.
This seat had been occupied for more than ten years by a Republican and President Donald Trump had conquered this district by 20 percentage points.
According to political experts, the Democrats have a small advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for aid to China, and refused to do so.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognised and received little negative response from Washington.
Trump met with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he owned a hotel in Panama until his partners disbanded the management team of the Trump Organization.
Officials of the United States Department of Foreign Affairs have decided to withdraw the American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the 'recent decision to cease recognising Taiwan', said Heather Nauert, the minister's spokesman, in a statement earlier this month.
But punishments were only considered in the case of El Salvador, because the country received US aid $140 million in 2017, for control of narcotics, development and economic support.
The penalties proposed, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with high unemployment and high murder rates.
While internal meetings continued, North American and Central American officials held a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in preventing migrants from leaving to the United States.
However, in mid-September, some top officials from the government announced that they wanted the conference to continue, making all possible sanctions against El Salvador impossible in advance.
The plan is that Vice-President Mike Pence will give a speech at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance that the government attaches to the meeting, say diplomats.
And the three U.S. envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any strong messages about Washington's criminal measures.
A White House spokesman on behalf of Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who have agreed to discuss the internal debate subject to anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who was also close to the government and who also spoke on the basis of anonymity.
Study History
The next step may be the report of the special prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible opposition of the justice by Trump, for which severe evidence has now become publicly known.
Mueller is likely to focus his research on interplay between Trump's campaign and Russia in an attack on Russia's elections.
If Congress changes color, Trump has to answer for that institute, just as he's getting ready to turn to the voters again, and maybe he has to answer for a jury in a court.
That is a lot of sayings, and I do not want to suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable, neither that of his equivalents in Europe.
There will have to be choices made by all of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will determine how long the battle will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, but only if the West had resisted and Czechoslovakia had supported in Munich.
We fail and therefore miss an opportunity to prevent the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points of worship, and this speeds up or slows down the inexorable rise of democracy.
Americans are currently faced with several of these types of bending points.
What will we do if Trump fires deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, the man who has the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since the time this magazine reported that he, last year, had suggested secretly engaging with the President and that he had speculated on the suitability of the President for his office.
Rosenstein says the Times report is wrong.
"How will we react if the FBI's new requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or not fair, or if he is appointed in the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress that will call Trump responsible?
If we fail in these tests, democracy awaits a very long winter.
But I believe we will not fail by the lesson I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassador's residence.
She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me away to light candles for the Sabbath on the table on which a swastika was depicted.
With that as my heritage, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the race to Rapid Wien
Rangers receive Rapid Wien on Thursday visit and know that a victory on the Austrians, after the impressive match in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, puts them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee-blessure, the midfielder Graham Dorrans could not play his first race of the season until the 2-2 drawdown at Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use the results as a springboard for better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal really has a good eleven" said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game with the idea that something to win fell and came out the game with a point.
Maybe we could have even won at the end, but seen all over the game is an equal game probably an honest result.
They were probably better in the first half, but when we came out in the second half, we were the better team.
Coming Thursday is a new great European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points but it's going to be a tough game because they also had a good result in their last game. But if the audience gets behind us, I'm sure we can press on and get a positive result.
Last year was certainly heavy, from everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there's a feeling-good factor on the club.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it. The training is good.
Hopefully we can now press through, leave behind us the last season and succeed again."
Women cannot sleep because of fear of retirement
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how to receive care, few people discuss this with their relatives.
About half of the participants in Nationwide’s research said that they talked to their wives about the cost of long - term care.
And only 10% said they had talked to their children about this.
"People would like a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the steps necessary to conduct this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president for life insurance at Nationwide.
Here we go.
Talk to your spouse(o)t(e) and the children: You can't prepare your family to care if you don't make your wishes known well in time.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices may be a significant factor in determining costs.
Take up a financial adviser: Your adviser can also advise you on how to pay these expenses.
Your long-term financing options can include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or use own funds as insurance, as long as you have money.
Create your legal documents: Avoid legal struggle when insurance is required.
Ensure that you have a health authority so that you can appoint a trusted person who can oversee your medical care and ensure that the professionals keep up with your wishes in case you can no longer communicate.
Consider also a proxy for your financial affairs.
In that case, select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that the invoices are paid if you cannot do so yourself.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother encounters a medical emergency and is on its way to the hospital.
In that case, can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Make sure you put these details in a written plan, so that you have the information at your fingertips.
"It is not only the financial matters that are important, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicines are used?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Make sure that plan gets there."
Man shot several times with air pressure rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air pressure gun as he walked home after a night out.
The victim, forty plus, was in the Oxford Grove neighborhood of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was hit in his chest, abdomen and hand.
Officers described the shelter, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a 'willful act'.
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, said officials, and the expectation is that the death toll will continue to rise.
As the means of communication have been switched off, the official authorities have not yet received information from the Donggala government, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicentre of the quake with a force of 7,5 on the Richter scale.
In Palu more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes and is located at the end of a small bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379.800 in 2017.
The city was the 40th anniversary of the tsunami.
Donggala is a region that extends over 300 km along the coast of northwest Celebes.
The government, an administrative region just under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the most important activities in the economy of the province of Central Celebes, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been hit regularly by tsunamis in the last hundred years, according to the Indonesian disaster response agency.
In 1938 a tsunami claimed over 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck nine deaths in the west of Donggala in 1996.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often affected by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the most severe earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Atjeh on north Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries and claimed a total of 226,000 lives along the coasts of the Indian Ocean, more than half of this in Atjeh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes took place on the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds were killed on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a force of 6.8 on the Richter scale took place south of Java, the most densely populated island of Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that hit the south coast and required almost 700 lives.
2009: An earthquake with a force of 7.6 on the Richter scale hit the city of Padang, capital of the province of West-Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people found death.
2010: An earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale hit one of the Mentawai Islands, off the coast of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and demanded about 300 human lives.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Regent Pidie in Atjeh and caused destruction and panic, because people were reminded of the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people found the death toll from falling buildings.
2018: Several earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok, where more than 500 people were killed, for the most part on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be stranded temporarily.

Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, the former Governor of Alaska and candidate for the Vice-Presidentship, is arrested for accusing domestic violence.
Palin, 29 from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and opposition during the sentence, according to a report released by the Alaska State Troopers on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone off her.
Palin is held in custody in Mat-Su's house with a $500 bailout, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the judge on Saturday and declared himself 'innocent, certainly' when he was asked this, the network reported.
Palin is charged with three Class A violations, which means he can be sentenced to one year in prison and up to a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B violation, which is punishable with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It is not for the first time that Palin is charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017, he was accused of mistreating his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, then called the police to report the alleged abuse.
This case is now for the Alaskan Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of a domestic abuse, interference with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under the influence of the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by a veteran group, after linking her son's violent behavior to PTSS, that he would have retained his term of service in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunami: hundreds dead
At least 384 died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale has led to a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communications networks are disabled, while death rates are expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake took place just next to the center of Celebes, located northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
There are videos on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for suspects of a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York demand the death penalty for Sajfoello Sajpov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City, killing eight people, a rare punishment not carried out in this state since 1953.
Sajpov, 30, according to the charge, used a rented truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he drove pedestrians and cyclists who came on his way, over in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Sajpov 'intentionally' killed the eight victims and 'intentionally' caused serious physical injuries, according to the statement of intent in which the death penalty is demanded, which has been filed in the Southern District of New York.
In both cases, the death penalty is possible, according to the document submitted to the Court.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury has approved the charge with 22 charges, including eight charges of murder for a racket, typically a charge used by federal prosecutors against organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required 'substantial planning and preparation' according to the prosecutors and they described how Sajpov carried out the attack as 'abominable, cruel and corrupt'.
"Sajfoello Habiboellajevich Sajpov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleveland, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco" is in the statement of intent.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It is more than ten years since there was a case in the Southern District of New York requiring the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who had been executed after they had been sentenced to espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed by means of the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Sajpov, from Uzbekistan, did not show any remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to the judicial documents.
He let the detectives know he felt good about his deed, they the police.
Sajpov told the authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack after viewing videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the charge.
He also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his room in the hospital, told the police.
He pleaded not to be guilty of the imposition of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Sajpov, said he was 'naturally disappointed' with the decision of the prosecutors.
"We think that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt in exchange for a life sentence without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all concerned," said Patton.
The Sajpov defense had previously asked the prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MEPs say that NIGEL FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to mobilize a "people's army" during a protest at the Conservative Party's conference.
The former leader of Ukip said that the politicians must feel the 'hit' of the Eurosceptians, while one of the own Members of Theresa May proposed to give him the lead in the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the participants on March in Birmingham that the UK would 'be out already' had been Mr. Farage Brexit Minister.
But the challenge facing May in reconciling the strongly divided ranks is underlined by two conservatives who are pro-Remain and who participate in a separate protest meeting against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise on the road while it is being attacked by Brexitians, Remainers and the EU.
Components insisted that it will continue and will try to make a deal with Brussels despite the setbacks, thus forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and 'chaos'.
Bone said at a meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to throw 'Chequers in the trash basket'.
He proposed that Farage should be knighted and that negotiations with Brussels should be held under responsibility.
"If he made up the service, we'd be out of it now," said Bone.
The Member for Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit, but we must throw Chequers in the trash."
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in two world wars to be subordinate.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone suggested that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British population has changed its mind and wants to remain in the EU is completely untrue."
The conservative Brexitian Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the march and told reporters: "I just say, prime minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not voting, it is unpopular within our party and with our activists who go from door to door and make sure we are elected.
Drop Chequers and listen."
In a directed message for May, she added: "Premiers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the meeting that politicians must feel the 'hit' if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them "we're not gonna let you get away with this."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to shine the fire on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
We are mobilizing the national army of this country that has brought us the victory in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we become an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom again."
In the meantime Remainers marched through Birmingham and concluded this March with a meeting of two hours in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved with flags on which Tories Against Brexit stood, after the establishment of this group on the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of Labour College, joked about the security problems of a Conservative party app at the beginning of their conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can provide IT systems and for all technology for Canada plus, for the non-violent border, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
It's a full farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plant 'well to go thinking' about candidacy for presidency
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she'll "think well about her candidacy for the presidency" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat told of her future at a meeting in a town hall in west Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, wants to be re-elected in November against Geoff Diehl, a Republican delegate who was co-chair of the Trom campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She has been the focus of speculation that she might be fighting Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump came to power.
An intern asked her if she would put herself in line for the presidency.
Warren replied that it's time for women to go to Washington to restore our defective government and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrest after shooting Wayde Sims from LSU
The Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested after the shooting of Wayde Sims, LSU basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at an ET press conference at 11:00.
They gave a video of the shooting incident on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man shown in the film.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound in his head and died of its consequences," said Sheriff Murphy J. Paul to the press on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson has been interrogated and has known to have been present in the crime scene, possessing a gun and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson has been arrested without further incidents and is detained in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a 1.98 meter junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games and started the last season in 10 games. He had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after Sebastian Vettel has left him victorious after orders from team
When Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes team orders would play a role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the pole position, leaving Hamilton almost completely in the cold when he defended his position and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the pitch and let Hamilton drive in the crowded tail of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes later entered the pits and came out behind Fettel, but Hamilton came back on the head after a wheel-on-wheel action that required the Ferrari rider to release space with countersense on the inside after a double movement in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the last place and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
He was then leader of the race for a time because he stayed at his band's selection and pointed for a quick finish so that he could pick up Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
Eventually he went to the pitch in the 44th round, after he could not increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so that Raikkonen became fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did his best fantastic all weekend. He was a real gentleman and left me by.
The team did its best for places one and two," said Hamilton.
That wasn't a good body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at an election meeting on Saturday about the fact that she was not the source of the leaked letter of Christine Blasey Ford, in which the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, was accused of assault.
Speaking at an election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not talk directly about the testimony given by Ford to the Senate Justice Committee. Instead, he informed that something took place in the Senate showed that people could be 'joint, ugly and untrue'."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful show that takes place in the last days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you are the people who are angry and mean and mean and unreal and untrue," he said.
"When you look at the press releases and leaks and then they say 'oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document-- 'oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we haven't leaked," he added, in an imitation of the senator.
In July, the letter in which the allegations were mentioned at Kavanaugh's address was sent to Feinstein by Ford and it was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that her office was the leak.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't leak her story," said Feinstein to the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me confidentially to go, and I treated it confidentially, as she had asked."
But the president turned out not to believe her denial and he made comments during the meeting on Saturday night: "I'll tell you something, that was not a good body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Further with his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats use the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power, with all necessary means.
You see the meanness, the folly, they don't give anything about who they're hurting, about whom they have to drive to seize power and get control back," the president would have said according to a report by Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants: 5-3
Patrick Dwyer made two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars have cleared the loss of Friday in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return match with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had names with two goals leading through scores of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team by the side before Dwyer put the Giants back in charge.
Francois Bouchard made the equalizer for Dundee, before Lukas Lundvald established Nielsen with two goals of victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for the men of Adam Keefe, who on Friday evening had to make up a hindrance to defeat Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth time this season that the two teams met, where the Giants won the previous three games.
In the fourth minute, the Dwyer's opening goal came at 3:35 on an assist from Kendall McFaull. David Rutherford gave the assist that Beauvilier doubled the lead, four minutes later.
In a busy opening period Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt gave the lead for the equalizer of Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants went in with a head start, when he made his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team recaptured and Bouchard brought them back to an equal position with a power-play-goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game, late in the second period. He took care of the victory with the fifth goal for his team, halfway in the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, are playing home against Milton Keynes in their next race on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies, while ensuring that hundreds can escape the earthquake in an aircraft
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is honored as a hero after he died because he made sure that an aircraft with hundreds of people could board safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are still missing after a heavy earthquake hit the island of Celebes on Friday; an earthquake that then caused a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks still plague the area and many are buried under the point in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, the 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild again moving traffic towers of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu airport.
He continued to ensure that flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was at that time ready to take off safely.
Then he got out of the traffic towers when he thought it was collapsed.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News from Australia.
We had arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"It breaks your heart when you hear it," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the death toll may rise to the thousands and let the country's disaster response agency know that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
"It is assumed that the death toll is still rising because many bodies were under the rubble and have not yet been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves reaching a height of six meters have destroyed Palu, where a massive funeral ceremony will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said Sky News: "Every minute bodies are brought in by ambulances.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is set up in a race to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived on Sunday in Palu and he said to the present soldiers: "I appeal to all of you to work day and night so that all tasks necessary for the evacuation are completed.
Are you ready?"CNN reported.
Indonesia has been hit by earthquakes in Lombok earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini says now that one man is missing after a crash in the lagoon
The airline operating the flight crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia is now saying that one more man is missing, after they had reported earlier that all 47 passengers and crew members had safely left the sunken aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a press release that one male passenger is missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said they worked with the local authorities, hospitals and detectives to find the man.
The air carrier did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew members, after the plane got to water during the landing at the Chuuk Islands airport.
The authorities announced on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that everyone's condition was stable.
What has caused the crash and what is the exact order of events remains unclear for the time being.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say that the plane has landed in the lagoon and missed the runway.
Some witnesses believe that the plane has been shot across the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the plane approached the airport very low.
"That's good news," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and some others succeeded in wading the water, which came to their aid, to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the stewardesses were panicking and yelling and that he had a non-serious head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that mariners who were in the vicinity working on a yard have also helped in the rescue operations by taking people to the coast with an inflatable boat, before the plane sank further into the about 30 - foot [30 m] deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that in the last 20 years 111 people have found the death in crashes of air carriers registered with PNG, but none of these relate to Air Niugini.
Analist sets the timeline of the night on which a woman is burned alive
The prosecutor closed his trial on Friday in the reopening process of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, analyst of the U.S. Department of Justice, gave a one-hour witness witness in the field of information analysis.
He made it clear to the jury how he had used the phone records of mobile phones to capture the movements of the 29-year-old suspect Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, in the night she left her life.
Rowlett said that he had received the location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was at Chambers on the night of her death, which was contrary to his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data found that his cell phone was at Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford again.
Sanford was in the testimony bench on Saturday and told me he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked Tellis to tell the truth when he told him that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "laughing because my truck was in Nashville then."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis had told us that he knew Chambers about two weeks when she died.
The cell phone records indicated that they only knew each other for one week.
Rowlett said that Tellis knew the text messages, calls and contact details of his phone some time after Chambers died.
"He knew her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense begins on Sunday with the final arguments.
The judge said that he expected the jury to start the deliberations later that day.
The High Width: What is 'conscious hiphop'?
A hipoptrio wants to question the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol states that hiphop is alienated from its origins with political opinions and the identification of social problems.
They want to return to the roots and make 'conscious hiphop' popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently had another experience in Great Britain by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
A nanny from New York is suing a couple before the judge for a 'racist' text
A nanny from New York is suing a couple before the judge for dismissal for discriminatory reasons, after receiving an erroneously sent text in which the mother had complained about 'against such a black'.
The couple refuses to be racist and calls the trial " extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed her horror when she discovered that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, turned out to be a negroid woman when she met her first working day in 2016.
'NEW SEA BEFORE A SWARTE', Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote a message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it twice to Mrs Maurice.
According to the New York Post U.S. newspaper, the Plasco-Flaxman, who felt "uneasy," fired Mrs. Maurice when she realized her blunder, saying that their former nanny, who was African-American, had done bad work, and that she therefore expected a Filipino.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a working day and was then sent home by taxi.
Now Maurice is taking the couple to court to get a $350 compensation-- per day for the six months she was hired for internship with the family, though without a contract.
"I want them to feel that you just don't do something like that," says Maurice last Friday at the New York Post, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple dissuade themselves from the claim that they are racist by saying that it was reasonable to dismiss Maurice after she, through her insults, feared that they could no longer trust her.
"My wife sent her a message that she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists', told husband Joel Plasco at the New York Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone who insulted you, even if it was by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Don't say that.
On the trial compare with 'torture', Plasco said that his wife expected a baby in two months and 'was in a very difficult situation'.
"Are you going to persecute someone like that?
That's not as sympathetic', the investment banker added it.
While the trial is still under way, public opinion is quick to chapter the couple on social media, where they are held for their conduct and reasoning.
The publishers of Paddington feared that the public wouldn't have much interest in a talking bear, revealed new emergent letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the approval of the book, said about the letter: 'It's hard to stand in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time, for the first publication.
With what we now know about Paddington's enormous success, it's very convenient."
She said that her father, before being inspired to write the children's book about a small toy bear, if cameraman worked at the British channel BBC, was optimistic about whether his book would be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book 'bittersweet' felt after his death last year.
About Paddington, which she describes as 'a very prominent member of the family', she said that her father was secretly proud of the ultimate success.
She said, "He was a quiet, modest man."
'But because Paddington was so lifelike for him, it seemed like a child's performance; you're proud when you didn't do anything for it yourself.
I think he experienced almost the success of Paddington.
Although Paddington was the creation of his own imagination, he himself honored the bear for success."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her by phone.
Immediately after the landing, her daughter was brought to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life in vain.
'Nad had called several times to say that it looked very bad and that it was expected that she would not make it,' said Mrs Ednan-Laperous.
"Then the call from Nad came to say that she would die in two minutes and that I had to say good-bye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
We'll be back together soon.
Then I'll be with you again.
The drugs the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping became slowly worked out and left her body.
She had died some time before that, and this process continued to turn everything off.
I could only sit there knowing what was happening.
I couldn't feel sorry, scream or cry, because I was sitting in the middle of people and families.
I really had to keep my size."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the death of her daughter, stepped into the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what the trial would be.
"No one knew," she said.
"I was with my head down and the tears kept coming.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I got an overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Raw women paste messages on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who are loved by suicide are strong enough to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey's posters inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call in need for help on a bridge in Wales
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he first became depressed and he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel like how I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old and residing in Lydney in Gloucestershire County, reported that her son was a promising chef with an insidious grin.
"He was known for his smile.
It was always said that his smile lit every room."
Yet he had already stopped working for his death because he was deep in the well."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, found him after he had robbed himself of life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried about a chain reaction."
Mrs. Davis made the cards; 'to let people know that there are others where you can go and what you can talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't keep quiet - talk about it."
Mrs Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs Davies for years, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt sad or depressed or something," she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He sat all the way to the ground on Christmas Day - when the kids were unpacking their presents he didn't look at them at all or anything."
She said that his death was a great trauma to them, but that they have to deal with it: "It's tearing the whole family apart.
It drives us apart.
But we all have to keep fighting and keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain as FBI research starts
'I thought that if we could indeed get what he asked for; a study limited to time and scope, we might be able to create more unity again', said Mr Flake last Saturday, to which he added, that he was afraid that the committee was falling apart, amid a firmly anchored petition within the party.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance has everything to do with timing.
The mid-term elections are already in five weeks, on 6 November and if, as expected, Republicans do badly, their efforts to get their husbands elected in the highest court in the country are seriously complicated.
George W. Bush has already called with members of the U.S. Senate to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and thus met his wife Ashley, who was the Bush his personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI prepares the report?
Then there is a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 democrats are currently sitting.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can count on at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that would allow Mike Pence, Vice-President, to cast the decisive vote to confirm the appointment of Kavanaugh before the Supreme Court.
Number of casualties in North Korea 'down' under Kim
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of North Korean invaders has fallen to South Korea since Kim Jong-un came into power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-suck, quoted from data from the South Korean Ministry of Unity, states that there were 1,127 casualties last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park notes that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher penalties for traffickers are the main factors for the decline.
Pyongyang hasn't responded in public.
The vast majority of the victims from North Korea are ultimately offered the South Korean nationality.
According to sources in Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them fled through China, which has the longest external border with North Korea and where you can make the crossing easier than in the heavily secured Demilitarized Zone (DMZ; Demilitarised Zone) between the two Koreas.
China considers the offenders to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often expels them with violence.
North-South relations, which are still formally at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, mainly talking about the stagnant negotiations on de-nuclearisation.
This meeting took place after the historic meeting between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un, in Singapore in June, where they agreed to work on the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the US of lack of progress in lifting American sanctions since then.
'Without belief in US action, there is also a lack of confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances there is no first step towards unilateral disarmament', says Mr Ri during a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical', and finds him unable to serve in the Supreme Court
Chairman of the House of Deputies, Nancy Pelosi, called the U.S. Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterically' and found him unable to serve in the Supreme Court
Pelosi made the comments in an interview, Saturday at the 'Texas Tribune Festival' in Austin, Texas.
'I couldn't help thinking that if a woman behaved like that, they would call her 'hysterical',' Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the accusations that he would have sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional; he sometimes yelled almost and was especially upset when he told about his family and his high school days.
He also strongly condemned the democrats in the committee, calling the accusations against him 'grotesque and co-ordinated character murder', organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi stated that she found Kavanaugh's testimony to prove that he was not fit to serve the Supreme Court because he was fully prejudiced against the democrats.
'I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way he talks about the Clintons and the Democrats', Pelosi said.
Pelosi protested when she was asked whether she would try to institute an impeachment procedure against Kavanaugh if he were appointed, and the democrats would get the majority in the House of Deputies.
"That's what I can say about this: if he doesn't tell the truth in Congress, or the FBI, he's not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he serves now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Court of Justice of the 'District of Columbia' (usually abbreviated D.C.) District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she was concerned that Kavanaugh would speak against the 'Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade' (Law for affordable health care). Kavanaugh is known as a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh asked questions about revising certain decisions of the Supreme Court at the confirmation hearings.
'Don't expect us to stand cheering when a hysterical, prejudiced person is appointed to the Supreme Court', Pelosi says.
Women just have to admit this.
It's a fair tyrade of months and years of uptight anger that overflows, and she can only cry to get it out.
'We're going to cry when we get angry', Ms. Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's weird, do you?"
She continued, "I'm extremely helped by a woman who was leading somewhere and who told me that she too was going to cry when she got angry. She developed a method, where she was always getting angry, crying. To the one she was talking to, she said, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept crying.
I just thought that was brilliant."
Tears are partly permitted as an expression of anger, because crying is substantially misunderstood.
One of my best-kept memories from a former job, in a men-dominated office, is when I had to cry terribly because I was very angry. An older woman, a killer company leader who was a little scared of everyone, grabbed me in my neck and dragged me into a stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and happy they got you in the closet.
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a member of the Colorado Congress for the Democrats, had worked for Gary Hart on his candidacy for the presidency.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was involved in an out-of-court affair on board a boat called 'Monkey Business' (informally means 'cat quid' or 'apens') and withdrew from the race, the deeply disappointed Mrs Schroeder felt that there was no reason why she would not sue for herself.
"It wasn't a well-considered decision," she told me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already 7 other candidates in the race, and the last one they needed was another candidate.
Someone was talking about Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Because the campaign was already advanced, she was left behind with fundraising, and so she vowed not to participate if she could not raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who would give men $1,000, wanted to give her only $250.
"Do they think I might get a discount?" she wondered.
When she gave her speech in which she announced that she would not start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings - of gratitude for the people who had supported her - by frustration because the system made it so difficult to collect money, to reach voters instead of delegates, and of anger about sexism - that she choked.
"I will have thought that I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalled how the media responded to her.
"They'll have thought Kleenex was my business sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will they put on my tombstone?
"She cried"?
How the trade war between the US and China can be beneficial for Beijing
The opening salvos of the trade war between the US and China were deafened, and although the battle has not been fought for a long time, a gap between the two countries could, according to long-term experts, be favourable for Beijing.
Earlier this year Donald Trump, the president of the United States, gave the first warning by raising taxes on important Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation became known this week when new effective, increased tax rates were revealed for $200 billion (€150 billion) of goods; half of all goods coming from China are coming from the US.
Beijing has taken in kind represailles each time, most recently by increasing rates from 5 to 10% for 60 billion dollars in US goods.
China has promised to equalize the US every time, and the world on one of the second largest economies will probably not blink with the eyes.
In order to have Washington bow, requests must be granted, but publicly bowing to the US is far too painful for the Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts claim that if Beijing plays the smart game, the trade war with the USA, China could be positively supported in the longer term, as the interdependence of the two economies decreases.
'The fact that a rapid political decision could create conditions in Washington or Beijing, which could lead one of the two countries to fall into economic freedom, is actually much more dangerous than spectators have previously recognized', says Abigail Grace, a research assistant of the 'Center for a New American Security', a think tank specialising in national security issues focusing on Asia.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country destroyed by a war lasting more than seven years.
During his speech to the UN General Assembly, Mr Walid al-Moualem, Minister for Foreign Affairs, said that conditions in his country were improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he says.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists and to normalize the situation on the ground.
All the circumstances are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they have had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that threatened their daily lives and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
An estimated six million people live in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome help in restoring the devastated land.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that had subsidized the rebellion.
Europe wins the 'Ryder Cup' in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 on the golf course 'Le Golf National' south-west of Paris in France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the team of the Danish leader Thomas Bjorn scored the required number of 14.5 points to defeat the U.S.
The star of the American team, Phil Mickelson, who was struggling almost the entire tournament, had his long blow from the tea to the water at par 3, hole 16, and gave his loss to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, excelled in all his rounds and became one of the four players who ever scored 5-0-0 since the tournament in its present form began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was thrown out by playing the lowest score of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, with 5 holes down and 4 holes.
The highest-ranking player on the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 holes down and 1 hole playing Ian Poulter from Great Britain, who possibly played his last match in the Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Segrio Garcia, veteran with eight Ryder Cups, became the best European player of all tournaments ever with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't cry very soon, but today I can't do anything about it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad we got the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help', said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot, John Ram, who beat the American legend Tiger Woods with 2 holes down and 1 hole in the game for singles on Sunday.
"The enormous pride I feel because I have defeated Tiger Woods. I've been following that guy all the time when I grew up," says 23-year-old Ramm.
Woods won all four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic of one of the biggest players ever; winner of 14 major championships, second only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled the weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level during the whole tournament.
The U.S. commander, Jim Fury, said after the disappointing performance of his team, "I'm proud of these boys, they've fought.
Shortly this morning, we made Europe a little more difficult.
We offered resistance.
All respect for Thomas.
He's a great commander.
All 12 players in his team played very well.
I'm going to work with the American PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're looking ahead.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their leader.
You have to take your hat off for the opponent.
We're overplayed."
Red glow update: Concentrations decrease in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota provinces
The most recent report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (Florida Commission for the Conservation of Fish and Fauna) shows a general decrease in red glow concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay Area (located on the west coast of Florida in the US).
According to the committee, the report on fragmentary increases in the red glow in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which could indicate a decrease in concentrations.
The red glow extends over an average of 200 km of coastline, from the northern Pinellas to the southern Lee counties.
There are spots about 16 km off the coast of Hillsborough County, but in less places than last week.
Red glow was also seen in Pasco County.
Medium concentrations have been reported off the coast of Pinellas County over the past week, low to high concentrations off the coast of Hillsborough County, background to high concentrations in Manatee County, background to high concentrations on or off the coast of Sarasota County, background to high concentrations in Charlotte County, background to high concentrations on or off the coast of Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
Airway irritation in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier is continuously reported.
In the northwest of Florida, no mention was made of respiratory irritation in the last week.
