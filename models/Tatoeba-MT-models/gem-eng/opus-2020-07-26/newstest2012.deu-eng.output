No liberating amendment for Tymoshenko by Parliament
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament rejected the request to abolish the paragraph on the basis of which opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been convicted as part of a amendment to the Criminal Code.
The new regime, which could have paved the way for the release of the arrested Prime Minister, rejected the second reading of the request to reduce the penalties for economic crime.
In October, Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for the conclusion of a allegedly adverse treaty with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet final; in December, the appeal of the convicted is to be tried before the courts.
Timoshenko himself refers to the judgment as political revenge of the regime and also in the West, the trial raised the suspicion of preconception of the court.
The request to remove paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Prime Minister was sentenced to removal from the Criminal Code, was supported by 147 Members.
226 votes had to be adopted.
Libyan Victory
The history of Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the victors are to be defined.
As usual in this region, Islamists win in the elections, the question is only which - the moderated or radical.
The National Transitional Council recognized the customary law of the Sharī. Of this, one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would go to the country without crime, because for theft you're just hacking off your hand.
Women should also forget thoughts of emancipation as quickly as possible, be executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, society will be united by the Koran in the future.
In short - in Libya there will be an order that would be hardly imaginable and, above all, hardly desirable.
Only - our lifestyle isn't the only one and objectively seen, it's probably not the best and would hardly fit the Libyans mentioned.
Thus, it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters were helped by the faithless dogs at all.
To their excuse, it may be only the fact that NATO's air raids were not directed by any general from America, but by Allah himself, whose omnipotence was praised after every successful hit.
The victors in Libya?
We only participated in a shootout, served the interests of Islam and our politicians discharged themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred to look at Libya's military occupation.
As a result, the locals are concerned about the displacement of the cruisers.
Do the oil companies also get the black gold at the spot price without okkupation?
It is hardly and thus the West can finally boast of its selflessness in terms of the protection of human rights.
If they do not destroy these things, the shards.
Beginning of a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm hit Europe.
Each country published its data on its GDP for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the previous quarter, Germany and France admitted.
Today, however, the bond market is tearing down all records.
Investors not only keep an eye on Greece, but also Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European zone, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5%, as expected by France by 0.4%.
Both countries simultaneously corrected their data for the second quarter, where Germany recorded higher growth than originally expected (increased by 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), while France granted a slight decrease of 0.1% (original data only spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year.
Compared to the previous quarter, however, gross domestic product stagnated and according to Czech Statistical Office, the trend of growth slowing economic performance was confirmed.
The results are thus worse than the forecasts of the analysts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in the third quarter of this year compared with the previous quarter, but it stagnated.
According to provisional and seasonally overcalculated data, the German economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter.
Throughout the euro area and the EU, the economy recorded growth of 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is consistent with the analyst's expectations.
The Greek economy decreased by 5.2 percent compared to the previous year.
The return on its 10-year government bonds rose by 28.45%.
Return on Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also beginning to feel problems...
Return on Czech government bonds is below 4%, although the situation in the region is deteriorating.
In Germany, votes are made, the ECB is to become the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their 200 million qualification
The football selection has mastered the most difficult task of the whole season!
Thanks to a well-designed gatekeeper Čech and a magnificent gate by Petr Jiráček, she won 1:0 in Montenegro.
With a great deal of luck, the Czech football team was able to defend its luxurious advantage from home play and will once again not miss the European championship.
IHNED.cz followed the ascent game in a detailed reportage.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge portion of luck in the second.
The Czech selection also won 1:0 due to the final weakness of the home team, a brilliant Čech's and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro and has thus redeemed her ticket for the football-EM.
They also put more pressure on the Montenegrins only in the second half of the year because of the precise defense game of the Czech team accounts.
The pechbirds of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who shot two giant chances.
Thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech selection will also be part of the European Championships next year, and it is also gratifying that the domestic football team will receive a premium of about 200 million.
From the first minutes on, quite combative football was played.
Both teams combined long and so were played mainly around the middle line.
In the second half of the year too, the pressure of the home team remained out, and the large reductions in the penalty room were successfully prevented by the Czech defence.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They formed a living shield.
Some hundreds of university students formed a living shield around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country's core program before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had asked for lunch in front of the property and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students from the University of Iranian Isfahan formed on Tuesday a living shield around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan, where uranium is processed.
They wanted to know that they were ready to protect their country's core program, if necessary with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently noted in its report that Iran was apparently not abandoning its efforts to launch a nuclear weapon.
In Israel, too, we are talking about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear installations.
At noon, students had prayed before the entrance to the complex and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack on the intent to paralyze the Iranian nuclear program, according to the Israeli press, from the center of Isfahan would also be the nuclear enrichment plant in Nathan's attack target.
The menu of a fattened child: it does not breakfast and eats to the supper sausage
More than a third of children from 9 to 13 have overweight problems, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children overweight.
Current surveys proved - adipous children mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
So once again it shows how important for a person's healthy development is the environment in which he grows up and are the examples that surround him.
On the tables of adipous children, sausages are up to half more often on the table than in families where normal-weight children live.
More than 19 percent of the overweight children had on the day before the Enlightenment Action under the motto "Adipositas is no coincidence" French fries for supper.
In families with Dickerchen also sport is not just one of the favourite occupations, but also the majority of today's students - only 15 percent responded that their parents find themselves at least once a week for active movement.
Survey among 900 children
The survey took place last year towards the end of the school year, surveying almost 900 children from primary schools throughout the Czech Republic.
This was already the second year of the action "Adipositas is not a coincidence", which is supported by the General Hospital and the Unilever Society.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4th and 8th classes participated in the project.
Unhealthy food and lack of movement in the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the alarming number of overweight or even obese children.
"For example, only half of the children interviewed led to five times a day eating breakfast-second-breakfast lunch-vesper dinner-one of the main requirements for a healthy diet," says one of the survey results.
No breakfast and dinner sausage
Experts point out that even relative small things, such as the regular breakfast time of the family, are important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the students' families had breakfast.
And - in most families, everyone has breakfast alone.
The worst was the finding that in every tenth family is not cooked at all.
Breakfast is considered a foundation stone of healthy daily diet.
The survey showed, among other things, that the consumption of unhealthy French fries was much more frequent in the families of overweight children.
And almost everyone - without regard to weight - drinks sweet lemonades every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children interviewed sport, only less than half of their parents do so - that is, only 15 percent.
Make your own menu
A further part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own menu from the opportunities offered by appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children prefer between 12 and 15 in puncto diet is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favorite dishes were many flour dishes, meat dishes and, of course, sweet foods.
"Emerging is above all the great popularity of sweet lemonade", the final report on this survey emphasises.
At lunch, that is, the main dish, pasta won near poultry.
Legumes almost did not like the children at all, and also the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was very small.
Turning to health
At the same time, however, the survey also showed that the children are quite willing to change their eating habits if they get the right information.
"In many cases, a clear shift in preferences towards principles of healthy nutrition has been noted in the results of the project in the control group of survey participants who completed the questionnaire after completion of the informative presentation "Adipositas is no coincidence".
This was evident, for example, in the sweet limousine, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
The children also crossed in the questionnaire much more often poultry or fish as the main dish of the day and were prepared to eat less nuts or sweet foods.
Claiming professionals - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the opening article about how stylists learn, I had tasted a bit that this was a bit too much fabric for the beginning.
I had no idea what was going on.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how the "on the square" is going.
It's supposed to get worse.
The closer the exam, the more information and practical tasks are at our disposal.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully booked.
This time we debated with director Alena (at course not a single man) how to attract a woman who does not have an ideally proportionate figure.
And that's at least most of us.
One has one too short neck, the other one too young without decent curves and again others are chubby.
It is the thing of the stylist to visually cascade wide shoulders, extend the neck or enchant the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to dress a type of woman like Jennifer Lopez - so with big bust, wide hips and narrow waist - pretty and figure-like, without it being too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hip is so big that the skirt or pants really don't fit, at least one piece should be cut to measure.
You will not regret that, because well - seated clothing is simply priceless.
In such a tailor-made skirt, you feel much better than in one of the bars that always stand in the waist, and so on.
Young figures can in turn allow themselves to wear clothing with wrinkles, trousers, applications, embroidery or raffling.
With this amount of information and figurines, I am glad that I have a whole week to let everything go through my mind thoroughly.
And yet I'm afraid it's almost impossible to create in view of the assignment.
Each of the students was awarded a prize for which they are supposed to design suitable outfits - dayclothes and nightdresses.
In doing so, we should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the respective star and its figure type.
I'm supposed to attract Miranda Kerr, who might know you from Victoria's Secret's campaign.
Inside, I cheered, for it is much better for me personally than to attract Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has probably recently increased to the hundred kilos (well, that's a bit exaggerated), or also the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut out the pieces of clothing from magazines or search the Internet, print out and then work graphically.
In the "Moodboard", as the whole result is called, our very personal style and our relationship to graphic design should then be expressed.
It is very important to also think about the graphic side of the styling.
The stylist not only physically attracts the models, but also designs the so-called product page in the journals (according to specific specifications, for example trend handbags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about this.
But that's not until Sunday.
That means that a stylist must have a good overall view.
The Saturday talk, filled with information on the types of figures, was just as spiced by three visitors from the industry:
by Stylist Jan Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a stylist should be able to take advantage of it.
And sent-in stylist can work with a single piece of clothing in quite different ways.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a Trenchcoat as usual over the jeans, i.e. like a T-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, wear heel shoes and wear it as a dress.
It's enough to curl up the sleeves or collars and the whole look looks completely different.
"Play with it," he stressed.
But most of it was the following council: "First you must know the rules perfectly."
"First, you may hurt her," said Jakub.
Finally, I realize why we need to break all these lessons, what can be combined with what and why, even if you often get to see very different things in fashion journals.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared a lot more clothing variants than he finally photographed.
So you have to be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (in other words 10 outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks quite different than in reality.
So with all of that, you have to count on the design of the outfit.
That image and style sometimes make up half of the success, that also confirmed us Jan Pokorný.
You just need to watch Madonna, a not-so-yet brilliant singer who made an image and marketing a star of the world.
In the Czech Republic, one is rather opposed to the services of a stylist.
Also known personalities often think this is money thrown out (the main thing is that I bring something that I look secondary).
And if any of us can be styled, then we should expect that he or she will most likely force us on a different (smaller) size than he or she really needs.
Then you only need to google to make sure that the boulevard press writes, the corresponding promi has returned to or dropped, etc.
Jan and Mario put us to the heart on Sunday not to believe that a stylist just needs to focus on the fashion and then to "build up" the outfit.
In his work he must communicate primarily with the people he styles and he must be a weighty psychologist.
People appreciate without offering themselves and standing in his opinion.
"If any manager orders us to screen their wardrobe and to add nice pieces, then we can't get her out of the closet and say - my God, that's terrible."
"At least you have to find some praiseworthy things to which you recommend what you can wear," says Mario.
He also showed us very specifically what such a so-called "platz bag" must contain.
So this is a bag that you tie to the waist and in which you carry all the necessary propreets with you.
In addition to clear items such as scissors, rollers for hair removal or safety needles, it also contains such utensils as a nylon thread (which helps the stylist to photograph products, such as handbags or hats), special clips with which the clothes are worn behind if they are too large (signs or other clamps are prohibited so that the fabric is not broken) and of course seams.
In order for us not only to listen but also to try out something practical, we learned how to put shoes on properly.
Even when photographing in the studio, where the floor is right, you can damage the shoe sole, quiet the outside.
We were glued and we were glued...
With the scissors you can't even touch the shoes so that you don't damage them.
So you really have to be smart.
Mario pleased me by praising my "creation" without restrictions.
The skill mentioned is not exactly my strength.
All of this was just the fraction of what we got to hear on the second weekend continuation course.
One thing has become clear to me in the meantime - dedicated to the styling on a professional level, is not a game of children.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The originally carefree ride is avoided by a series of dilettant mistakes to the routine drive to the early shift.
Although it was possible to fulfill the ambitions to a large extent, what it does is useful if obviously no one wanted to do a little more.
Even before he came to the counter, the new part aroused high expectations with the subtitle "The Run".
He promised to move the old series "Need for Speed" back into a new dimension and in the playable demonstrations, he did not seem to be just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious about how the fit passages that the main protagonist got out of the car and went on foot.
But how to get used to NFS is much different in the final effect than one expected.
Sure - potentially it's pretty decent arcade races, but overall, the game is mutilated by some superfluous errors that are present in this series for more or less a few years.
So there are actually no mistakes anymore, but rather signs of a basically immeasurable laziness of game developers.
The adventure begins very well.
For the first time, it is introduced into history, whose main character Jack has certain problems of personal character; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, so on the west coast, you sit on the steering wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea includes a whole series of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and into more than fifty single races.
This means that each race is performed on a different route and that the individual stages take place in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don't have a moment to think that game would always offer the same thing.
Some environments are still very nice to see, although the technical level of the graphics does not go beyond that of the previous parts of the series.
So nothing moving around the world.
But the journey through the desert, through autumn landscape or up through deep snowy landscape seemed visually very pleasant.
Occasionally, untypical elements bring a little variety into the individual races.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm that greatly reduces vision.
In the mountains, in turn, you have to be perfectly careful not to be wasted by an avalanche.
By the way, the individual races are quite well installed in a row.
It's just a few, but it's enough.
For a while you try to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to pick up (classical race against the stopwatch), then you expect another personal duel with a single contrahent.
And that's what the police are trying to mess up the whole thing.
One new thing is passages where Jack leaves the car.
This is more about certain interactive animations in which Jack flees from someone and where the player needs to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It surprises, however, that in the game there are far less such passages than one would expect (in particular, only three).
In the end, this is more of an advantage, because this element has at least no chance of becoming boring - it belongs in the context of the above mentioned elements that make the game more varied.
The driving model climbs into the footprints of the preceding parts.
That means, from today's point of view, it doesn't tear any trees out, on the other hand, you can't claim it would be bad.
Those looking for realistic simulations have to look around elsewhere.
But an action-loaded race continues to be quite justifiable, even though one could find better in competition.
Until then, everything is in order.
Real problems only appear after some time.
In contrast to the driving model, the collision model is not entirely O.K.
A game of this kind can hardly be expected to calculate complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have virtually no impact on any object, how the car behaves, then obviously not everything is okay.
Typical example: When you overtake or overrun the cars that are coming to you, you "straighten" the other cars in some places only slightly, in other, almost identical situations, but you get into the mud and twist wild pirouettes.
Or drive the car straight to junk.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn't matter any more, it's always annoying.
The reboots are solved this way: if you have total damage or land far away from the track, you throw the game back at the last point of the route.
Just - in every race you only have five reboots.
Once you've exhausted them, it's all going to go from the front.
So the reboots are more like a tool, in case something doesn't work, but you shouldn't rely on it.
Sometimes, however, not even the reboot helps to learn nothing but the critical section from the head.
It is very unpleasant that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some curves, for example, you have to go through in a very specific way, otherwise you just don't fit through.
On the other hand, at the corresponding point, "civil" cars are always encountered in the same configuration, regardless of whether one comes first or fifth, five seconds earlier or one minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations when you see that the contrahent comes by before a playing on two opposing cars, but until you even get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to bypass them or brake them.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, because everything is designed so that it always comes close to this situation in front of your nose.
Contractors have additional advantages.
Throughout the game there are a few places where you are always being overtaken in the same place by the same opponent and here again without regard to the time.
At the craziest, this is at the end of the game on the long bridge that you happen in opposite direction.
The contrahent must obviously get one out of here on the devil.
And then if he's already in front of you, he'll take a natural view, so that you first drive your own car a few times in a lump.
Of course - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting, but this intention is so clear that it misses a quick joy at the game.
And that's a pity, because despite a simpler driving model, the game in general is quite entertaining and sometimes also so charged that you almost don't know where one of the heads is.
And in principle it doesn't matter what "debt" is about - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that no boredom can arise, or something quite different...
An unusual idea is also the change of cars during the race.
You must not overlook the gas stations on the track, because right here you can change the car, although in most cases the car you have just got is enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight highways and exotic super sports cars for the technical rides, for example on the Serpentines in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode of the game history goes also the task mode (challenges) - thus the races in the individual localities known from history.
There are not only medals here, but also points to gain experience for your own profile, which is together for the tasks (challenges) and history.
To get to the higher driver level, different items need to be unlocked: starting from the car up to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is at the same time connected to the Autolog online function, which among other things compares its own achieved results to those of other players and also provides additional collective functions.
One of other incomprehensible cutters is a situation in the last race of history.
This is where you get to a subway tunnel (in the middle of the way), where you take a ride on the tracks in the dark (in the middle of the road).
On the Tacho look at numbers between 150 a 200 km/h (meaning road), but there comes a subway at once from the back and drives a uncompromising to scrap.
In our editorial team we'll probably be arguing for a long time about whether this was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think we're so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the visual overall impression is in most cases quite appealing and even brilliant here and there.
The more annoying it is that, at some exciting moments, the frequency of images is slowing down and this sometimes is quite dramatic.
This applies, however, in particular, to accidents involving a larger number of participants, where a continuous FPS does not benefit at all.
The sound reproduction is as far as OK. and the sound track is tasteful.
In the effort to reach as broad a scale as possible rather young audiences, a soundtrack a lay "of everyone something" was created - but who buys such a game already because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game were not mutilated by the above-mentioned totally unnecessary mistakes, we could have asserted with the chest tone that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's how the game looks somehow unfinished.
In itself a great pleasure, but one should be prepared to put these mistakes in the eye with the power of airport lights.
Concert of the "Students of the Joint Revolution" with singing ensembles of Karlsuniversity
The Festival Festa Academica is now the third time that the World Student Day is suffocated with the anniversary of the Samen Revolution and this including music experience.
In the course of the festival, the twenty professional and university choirs are presented.
The festival focuses on the two concerts that take place on 17 November.
"Karlsuniversity has a large part to play in the festival."
"The choir of the Pedagogical Faculty and the Faculty of Humanities is also represented among the participants, and in the festival committee the Rector Václav Hampl, among other things," said Jakub Čaloun, head of the organization team.
The festival's absolute highlight is the public concert by Fachschulechör, which takes place on November 17th from 2 p.m. on the square in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
The program includes the composition of the important Czech jazz player Karel Růžička "Celebration Jazz Mass".
In the evening hours, the concert "Students of the Joint Revolution" (Studenty samtu) will take place in the Galarumen des Volkshaus in Vinohrady, where there are also university choirs.
Festa Academica sets out the goal not only to celebrate the World Student Day and to commemorate the 22nd anniversary of the Samen Revolution, but to present Choral Music at the highest level to the public and to promote the creative cooperation of young people.
The main organiser is the association of Czech choirs in cooperation with the Johannes Kepler-Gymnasium.
The patronage over the entire event took over Bohuslav Svoboda, the mayor of Prague and Václav Hampl, the rector of Karlsuniversity.
The festival takes place in Prague from 16 to 20 November and in Pardubice.
The schedule also includes numerous music meetings, student happenings, Matinees and other events, except for festive concerts.
Detailed information can be found on the website of the festival www.festacademica.cz
EU ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativeists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has made the balance felt among the individual institutions out of the lot."
I didn't expect such a hard war to burn."
"It will take five or six years until the waves are smoothed and everyone gets used to their new role," began Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador at the European Union, quite sharply speaking at the Faculty of Law.
How seriously she takes the motto "understanding and openly about Europe" she showed in the first part of her lecture, in which she succeeded in describing the individual institutions of the EU and its mutual relations in such a manageable and understandable way that she could have needed so many lecturers from the Faculty of Law of Karlsuniversity.
Ms Vicenová also praised the new permanent President of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first criticism was voiced that he was too inconspicuous - a gray official who had not grown such a role, but I have to say that it has struck everyone's breath, how well he has assumed the matter.
"He is a person who manages to listen patiently to twenty-seven member states, communicate with them, and who, above all, has clear ideas about how to proceed with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, she then said in response to the question, "Who is this really - the European Union? What number should I call for?", i.e. as an important step towards the agreement and better readability of EU policies towards states, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban our oil cap quargel
Mrs Vicenová also devoted herself to the agenda that the European Union lived and intends to live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency two years ago called it a success.
The Czechs would have mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also organised the Eastern Partnership Summit.
The government’s case during the Presidency was a major negative one which had greatly damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU currently has all the hands to do.
With the words of the ambassador, it was not only the presidency but also the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome, that has been quite heated.
And the EU's seven-year budget still needs to be approved, which makes the matter much more complicated precisely because of today's economic situation.
Whether it will be a slim and economical budget, which sectors will be given priority, which countries will be more and which countries will be less encouraged - all this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls her own slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "understanding about Europe".
"If I don't like something, then it's horrible shorts, foreign words and professional jargon that nobody understands.
How should I, as a citizen, know whether we really think about curds in Brussels or round cucumbers and variously large bananas or whether someone really wants to ban the quargel?
It would have liked to use the ground of the EU to get more Czechs in European institutions.
A Europe of Two or Different Speeds in View
According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs are called to be Eurosceptics who perceive more negatively than the positive sides.
The weak representation of Czechs in European institutions is all the more annoying.
This is due to many factors, including the restraint of our candidates, whose inability to write motivational letters and not least the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me, if a pole or Hungarian comes to me and a Slovakia is nearby, then the Frenchman next to me means, "Hey, what are you putting your heads together - is that your V4 again?" and it makes a pretty angry smile.
According to Ms Vicenové, the EU is expecting tough rules for the budget policy of the Member States in the future.
As much more real, than a "European Federation", it sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
"We have the countries of the Eurozone and the countries outside the Eurozone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute of Enhanced Cooperation."
"For the first time, it has been said that only the countries that want to work together and those who do not want to do so should be quietly absent."
"There will be more and more institutions of this kind, which will ultimately lead to a strong "Europe of different speeds", says Vicenová.
In this respect, she also acknowledged the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in enforcing the principle, according to which all issues need to be discussed with an impact on the entire EU by all Member States and not only by the countries of the euro zone.
Brand Story:
Innovator IBM enters the second century of his existence
If one wanted to look for a suitable word that the strategy of IBM was the most precise character, then this would probably be the word "longevity".
For the general public, IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, one knows it as a modern company, although since its founding it has been extended for a century.
The basis for this longevity was already her first boss - visionary Thomas J. Watson.
Even though he represented the slogan, countless worldwide problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a little.
His slogan "Think!" became the trademark to play the life of the future giant (and at the same time the title of the internal magazine, which began to be published by IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of the company culture that was thoroughly prepared by Watsen.
"For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was also successful for a whole century because it has remained faithful to its principles and did not shrink back from changing everything else around.
This allowed us to transform the technologies, business and society in the course of our first century.
We hope to achieve even more in the next hundred years," said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company's current director on the occasion of the anniversary.
Sustained system
Watson has been in the social care of his employees for the thirty years - similar to that of the entrepreneur Baťa in Czechoslovakia: The IBM people had paid as one of the first American employees, an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as workwear and a thought-out pay system for the best new and merchants.
IBM's long-term relationships with its customers are equally elucidated.
From the beginning, the company was ingenious in talent promotion - as one of the first companies worldwide raised any discrimination against IBM - and was able to make the same choice.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is also to replace Palmisan at the top of IBM next year with a woman - Virginia Rometty.
IBM has been there for thirty years, so far she has taken up the position of the Vetriebs, Marketing and Strategy Manager.
In recent years, IBM has been making so-called online brainstormings, from which many future strategies and innovations grow.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, in the company nearly half a million people are employed.
An institution with a reputation
Their unshakable position in the business guarantees the company a strong image and this inside and outside.
"From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company," said Harvard Business School professor and author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technologies," George Colony of Consulting-Company Forrester Research added.
As the company itself emphasizes, it is a difference to be present only on the market or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of its logo because of its familiar "Big Blue", has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies ever - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructures, hosting and consulting services in an incredible product range - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies, IBM has the most patents and already five of its employees have been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His best-known inventions include, for example, ATMs, credit cards, financial swaps, barcodes or the diskette.
With around 220 billion dollars of market capitalization, IBM was the second largest technology company (similar to Apple) this year, with Microsoft overtaking it for the first time since 1996.
The Look Ahead
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today's customers - unhappy were for example the attempt with its own operating system OS/2, the online service Prodigy or also the computers IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so you must not bind emotionally to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM has no problem building its foundations on different platforms - and if they don't work, they're leaving again.
Unlike the opponent Microsoft, which basically stands and falls with its operating system Windows.
Promising technologies
IBM's winnings are largely part of services, software, and hardware, with a total of one-fifth of each.
In 1990, hardware with more than fifty percent of its share was the most represented.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profit-bearing assets worth 15 billion dollars, but at the same time it invested 58 billion dollars in the purchase of future-looking technologies.
In these investments, IBM continues after 2008, when the modern financial crisis sweeped the world like a storm for the first time.
Here, too, IBM remained faithful to the legacy of his first boss Thomas J. Watson, who increased its investment in the midst of the major global economic crisis.
So far, it seems that IBM will survive the current crisis without prejudice.
Since 2008, the value of the IBM shares has increased by 120 percent rocketlikely and the company's clean profit is growing continuously.
The company logo of IBM is: everything can be changed - only the values can't be changed.
This is also why it can be expected that this flexible giant will also master the next crisis.
IBM history: From cheese cutter to all around the world
Founded a century ago in New York, IBM (International Business Machines) initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
IBM took its name only in 1924 - originally it was a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation for the later IBM company laid the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They had technologies such as the famous ticket numbers for registration of the start and end of work.
Charles Ranlett Flint, who was also Chairman of the Supervisory Board until 1930, became the architect of this new company.
And it was Flint who hired Thomas J. Watson's manager to help him manage the company.
This leader then even put the founder of IBM in the shadows - based on Watson's ideas to this day the invincible culture and identity of the company.
Watson managed the company until 1952.
IBM, as already the name reveals, began with the production and distribution of all possible machines for trade - from sausage and cheese cutters, to cash.
In the first four decades that Watson was running the company, he doubled its sales to nine million dollars and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that he sat in the chair for forty years, only then was he replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his direction, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM technicians and computers helped manage NASA flights into space - to Mercury and Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight of man to the Moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the series IBM System/360.
A classic PC that set the computer standard of that time came to the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, she bought the consultancy part of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and entered into the business with highly-valued consultancy services and services.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off over the last three years is the concept of Smart Planet.
It embodies the intention to use technologies wisely in previously unplanned areas, e.g. to improve the situation in transport and urban administration.
In the retail sector, IBM recently introduced the Smarter Commerce platform to help retailers manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong story in the Czech Republic.
Already in 1932, IBM founded a branch in Czechoslovakia - as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
Central for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and there is also a world-level top team of researchers dealing with voice recognition technology.
Darina Rychtářová over her unfaithful husband:
Iveta - you can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now it's over!
After her spouse Josef Rychtář (53) became her lover by the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), Darina remained hoping that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the rest of life it has set itself clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but not more than my partner," explained D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová had offered refuge to singer I. Bartošová in her own house, you probably wouldn't even have dreamed of how her husband would feel.
When Iveta moved back and forth on her pushes after 30 days, Joseph immediately went with her.
Yes, he even publicly knew that he loved them.
In time, Darina resigned, yes, it seemed as if she wanted to make up with her unfaithful husband again - but now she finally gave him the run.
Rychytář doesn't care who's sleeping with his wife
If Rychtář Iveta Bartošová should leave in the future, then he will certainly not receive open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, then I will not chase him out."
"However, not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a man to whom I still have certain attachments," Ms. Rychtářová told her; but she also said that she had already separated herself emotionally from him and was alone on mutual decency.
The fact that Darina had locked the back door to him so far bears Joseph with dignity.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I stay with Iveta, nothing changes."
"My wife wants a paper honor and I respect that."
"The company continues, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I make the purchases."
"With Darina I'm having a normal time, we don't share the bed," said J. Rychtář (the sheet) Blesk.
If Darina wants to seek a new love, he doesn't want to stop her.
"We don't sleep together, so I don't care if she has a boyfriend or who it is.
I realize that this is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta, and that is why I accept any responsibility.
The worst female misconceptions: How are you?
If you ask the men to call some typical female mischiefs, they shake some out of the sleeve without exception.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we let a few unsitten revisions happen again, which let the men roll the blood into the veins?
Shopping addiction
Do they want their husband to be a shopkeeper?
Do you have to buy at least one hater every week?
Do you like to go shopping and may it be a little more in action?
Then it's probably really about a weakness in your case.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their purchasing appetite half-way under control.
But hand to heart, which woman already thinks it would be better to just walk through a dress shop looking for a well-seated upper garment and not to try all (in all possible colour combinations) in the cabin?
Although shopping for most women is a hobby, for men it is often pure hell.
Think about how many times they've told their husband - you better stay out...
Constant Dissatisfaction
"Don't I get too fat?"
"I would have to lose at least five pounds - should I start jogging or gymnastics?"
"Do I ever like you?"
Does that seem familiar to them?
Yes?
Then you may also be among the women who are truly obsessed with what they look like.
That doesn't mean you're supposed to leave, but a lot of men are allergic to her when her wife constantly complains about her appearance.
The stronger gender is in agreement - with increasing frequency of complaints, women are becoming more and more unbearable.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's a fight against windmills.
Wash windows, wipe tiles and dust, scour the tub - and this at least twice a week.
Are you shoving with your partner, because he once again tramples dirty shoes on the clean tiles, you peel the kids, because that just scrubbed sink is already dirty again and because the glass door at the living room cabinet has fingerprints again, where polishing makes so much trouble?
If you suffer from this kind of "deviant", then you should know that you must not exaggerate anything and that the order and cleanliness of family life are not the first priority.
This measureless grain of purity can ultimately also damage mutual relations and, above all, peace within the family.
Pieces
"Poor sneakers come in the laundry basket."
"Do you really want to put on the old socks tomorrow?"
"You don't just throw a wet towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, do not be surprised that it brings him to the palm.
Of course that's not bad, they just want everything to have its order.
If the men knew this, then the women might not need so much mercenary.
Clapping and tramping
Some women would like to clapp and chat, and they would be cuddled behind their backs, or even slandered, or forged alliances.
Women are now focused on relationships, so they like to whine through such topics, such as - who, where, with whom, how and why.
Well, each of us women has a little harmless clap and tram in stock.
Hand on heart - that's probably all women's own.
But this is not to be confused with the clap-catchers of the largest calibers, to which nothing and no one is sacred, who probably despise everyone in their environment and which are particularly dangerous for women collectives.
Jágr and Voráček helped Philadelphia with their assistants to victory
At the Monday game of the NHL, the ice hockey storm Jaromír Jágr had a large share with two assistants in the 5:3 win of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina and is thus again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
In both cases, Claude Giroux, who was also an assistant and was selected as the best player in the match, was the leader of the nine-third-year-old ice hockey star.
Two assistants in the same game also recorded Jágr's co-player Jakub Voráček.
After the game, Jágr claimed to have prophesied Giroux for a big evening.
"Just before the game, I'll tell him that he's succeeding in a hat trick."
I kind of felt that way."
"Hin and again comes across such a feeling," said Jágr, after whose action Giroux scored a goal at the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later, the second hit also had "a Czech track".
Voráček fought the puck behind the Hurricanes gate and presented him to the successful Maxim Talbot between the circles.
A second before the first third, the home player Patrick Dwyer scored a short hand, but the second third again belonged to the flyers.
Concrete Giroux.
In cooperation with Jágr he scored his third hit, and then Wayne Simmonds directed his shot to the fourth goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely one of the best three," Jagr praised his center.
"I wouldn't have imagined in my life that at the end of my career I would play with such an ice hockey player as he does."
"I'm delighted."
"I cut my game on me."
"All the years in the NHL my fellow players put their game on me and now the spear turns around," Jágr smiled.
Carolina made the play even more a drama - through the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who got out of a penalty shot, came to a gate.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complication in which he was in over two against one successfully.
"Excellent prongers still worked in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I took a ride and (read) pulled to distant paws."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad that it worked," Voráček described the last hit of the game from his point of view.
This victory put Philadelphia at the top of the eastern conference.
The Czech defenseman of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček injured himself in the game against Buffalo and resigned in the second third due to an injury to his upper body.
Besides their experienced Beck, the Candiens suffered a loss of leadership in the 2:3 Penalty shooting.
Tomáš Plekanec was unable to change one of the penalty shots.
More than the lost points, the coach of the home team probably hurt the high disease-related failure in the defensive - the game only ended with five defense players.
"That's bad."
"We only finished the meeting with one experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But nothing can be done, so we have to finish," said Jacques Martin.
"Each change had an attack wave after another, and we had nothing to do with it."
"We should have made the game easier and brought the puck out of our third."
There were still reserves here," said P. K. Subban, one of the defence players.
The Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec defended thirty shots from Tampa Bay and thus contributed significantly to the 5:2 win over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the jets, which ended a series of five defeats, five different shooters participated.
Trends in travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five approved state travel offices in the then ČSSR: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
At the time, the travel offices sold mainly only trips to the socialist Eastern bloc countries, in the West only those who were allowed to choose at that time.
And so Czech tourists traveled to the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimea Peninsula on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when Yugoslavia was also allowed to travel, Yugoslavia took a pro-western course and therefore travel to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that even citizens of the Eastern bloc (also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the ČSSR wanted to travel to Poland individually or even to the Soviet Union, then he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
The travel agencies also offered travel to the West at the time, but then you had to buy huge snakes or even stay in the sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel office.
This was not the case for a long time.
The so-called foreign exchange commitment - the condition for an exit to the West - was granted only to "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so it would have been impossible to raise the necessary financial resources (Western currency) for a trip to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs therefore spent their holiday in the country, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and dates - a habit that continues to this day.
The 1989 revolution followed a journey revolution of the Czechs on their feet.
While a holiday in the GDR or in Bulgaria was the measure of all things until 1989, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their foreign holidays in countries around the world.
A huge paradox, which one is not even aware of today, is the fact that one could not travel to the current most popular holiday country of the Czech Republic - Croatia until 1989 at all because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
Just from the beginning of the 90s of the past century, foreign exchange obligations were lifted in neighbouring Western European countries, which led to a huge wave of short visits, particularly to Vienna in Austria and to Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could for a long time get from their travels to the West simply not enough, everyone wanted to have been there for at least a few days.
The Czech holidaymakers slept in the park when traveling to Paris in the tent, because who would have had the money for accommodation at the hotel or in a guest house at that time.
A typical feature of travel abroad from the Czech Republic was a fully packed trunk with canned, beer and permanent sausages etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown - after decades our tourists were finally able to buy the Western currency freely.
Our level of life and therefore the average salaries rose, which resulted in another important moment in 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, the travel agencies began to regularly prepare journeys through charter flights after 1997, making the journeys impossible thanks to the possibility to negotiate discounts compared to the past.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the USA, had already currencyless payments with all highly developed countries of the world, making travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "mail-samtenen" travel came in 2000, when thanks to the high demand of the first direct charter flight in an exotic country was completed - to Thailand.
Every year, direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers have been flying in far-off sunny countries; this year, 12 exotic destinations are flown directly from the Czech Republic.
To the 100 thousand Czechs travel every year in exotic countries!
Another important moment in the era that marked our "post-revolutionary" development came in 2008.
On November 17th, 2008, the US lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, making our country definitely one of the most advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs first spent more than half of their holiday abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history they spent more than 15 cents per head for a single holiday stay, including the cost at the resort.
The general meeting is supposed to find a new chairman - again threatening a platt.
For almost five months now, the Czech football team has no chairman and threatens that the successor of Ivan Hašek at the top of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not even be known after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
To date, there is no agreement as to which electoral rules should be adopted.
And without these, no vote on the three potential successors is possible at all.
Three interested people want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek resigned from his position, calling on his colleagues to find some and a strong personality who could lead football in the future.
Only - in the era of Hašek the old querels broke out between the two federation chambers again, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was clearly demonstrated on 16 September when the new chairman was to be selected.
The delegates to the General Assembly had come to the People's House in the Prague district of Smíchov for nothing, and this was not just about the choice itself.
It was not even possible to agree on who was actually entitled to vote in the assembly - only the seat representatives or the officials with authority.
In this single point, at least partial agreement was reached, including the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, which, in the opinion of an authorised representative, was not adjourned.
However, disputes surrounding the electoral system continue.
Nor did the Executive Committee bring any clarity to the point where, in principle, meetings, whether ordinary or extraordinary, are no longer on the agenda at all.
Even if opinions about the elections changed a few times - the neuralistic point remained the same.
The question is: how should one proceed in the third round in order to avoid a pat situation?
"The point of dispute concerns whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes, or whether to find a completely different model," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-chairmen of the FAČR, who represents the professional football in the management.
In the third round of the candidate who receives the greater percentage support in the chamber for which he is running, according to the siting model.
Moravia is allegedly prepared to compromise that the candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers wins.
The Czech side, in turn, is based on the condition that the winner receives at least one two-third majority in this percentage vote.
"Then the two preliminary rounds have no meaning at all, this mode would call into question the entire two-chamber concept," said Svoboda, understanding the objections of the Moravian side, which it was best to choose not to bend the electoral order, but according to valid statutes.
Surprisingly, Tomáš Paclik also agrees, even though it is noted that the electoral system is most likely to meet Pelta by all candidates.
"My wish is to be elected as far as possible after the Statute."
"This does not mean that any unreasonable alternative is devised, as at the last Annual General Meeting," said the owner (the football club) Victoria Plzeň, who rand for the first time and distinguished himself mainly from Pelta in his comments.
Pelta, however, remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also work constructively together in the future.
"The potential qualification of the national team for football EM today would certainly contribute to the calming of the moods."
"When the football only rides on the euphoric wave, the willingness to cooperate is greater," says Jablonec's official, who brings the greatest experience from all three adepts and this at both professional and regional level.
Rajchl's more restrained.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately contradictory."
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts to "righten" the rules for their own purposes."
"That is why a further blockage at the Annual General Meeting is not excluded."
"I hope, however, that the common sense will finally prevail," Rajchl said.
Only - a lot of time to agree all sides is no longer left.
Some negotiations should allegedly take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the football overall will be complete until the qualifying game at all.
The charter aircraft to which Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl, among other things, were supposed to fly to Podgorica, could not even start in Prague in the morning because of a technical disturbance, and so one looked feverishly for a substitute variant, such as bringing a part of the executive committee to the venue of the Barrage game.
Finally, the meeting at ministerial level is crucial, to which it is supposed to come on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Body Education, would have liked to have moved the split parties within the country's largest sports association to an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state grants, the trustworthiness of Czech football and also the upcoming general meeting of ČSTV, which aims to guide Czech sport to the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik goes into the struggle for the chairman's position because he sees no suitable candidate
If Tomáš Paclik, the head of the Pilsner Footballer before the extraordinary general meeting, could have been a strong candidate who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new Chairman of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), he would not have taken up the fight for this top position at all.
"If there were a good candidate, I would fight for him and refrain from the choice."
"But in the current situation, it was not possible to find such an adept," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclik to go to Duell with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is thus to prevent the alleged favorite of the election, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also emphasises that in the event of his victory, he intends to perform the role of chairman only for one year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the ordinary general meeting.
In the position of the chairman, he would have liked to have seen an experienced top manager, who is not too much entangled in the football business.
"I spoke personally with some of the people in question."
"It's hard to believe that some of them told me they didn't want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
"Such views would have liked to change," he said.
Most of all, Paclík allegedly disturbs the link of Pelta's with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation who is regarded as a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegation meetings on general meetings.
For this reason, it is unacceptable for Paclik that Pelta had the position of chairman.
"In his victory, the present state would be preserved and in Czech football it did not progress at all."
"The support of Berbr, a clever businessman, got the football twice bad," said Paclik.
He also pointed out that Pelta's name was dropped some time ago in connection with telephone hearings to investigate in a corruption affair, but that Pelta was more severe.
"I don't know which prestige a victory of Pelta should bring in football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said řekl Paklik, who spoke earlier, "he will sell the Pilsner Football Club if Pelta becomes chairman," but already sees something more calm.
However, if Paclík won the Thursday elections, he could well imagine future cooperation with Pelta.
Similarly, another candidate - Rajchl, who had supported Paklik before the October general meeting, ended up with a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) was the first one I would go to."
"He has great abilities."
"I could imagine him well, for example, as head of the national team."
"But I don't think he's able to lead the Federation as a manager."
"I don't put my nose in matters I don't understand," said Paclík, who in September made sure that he was at the head of the Dagmar Damková after the appointment of the referee's commission.
Paclík himself claims to feel that he has grown the role of the president of the Federation.
And he is referring to his skills in the management of private companies, since last summer he is also the head of Pilsen, who celebrated the first triumph in the league with his support in May.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and to contribute to a certain cultivation of this."
"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups who tend to influence Disciplinary and vocational commissions, which may well be in present-day situations," said Paclík, who does not make a henchman from his antipathy, for example, to the Sparta Chief Daniel Křetínský.
As one of his priorities, he saw the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with which he would praise the political leaders for the fact that more money flows from the lottery tax into sport.
"This is one of the crucial things that the new President should devote himself to".
"When it comes to the taxation of gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their argument, but then they must also be rock and clear about where the money is going," he said.
His connection to the Pilsner Club also does not see Paclík as a handicap, although he himself emphasizes that the chairman of the FAČR must be "superpartisan".
Pelta in turn is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl to Prague's Dukla.
"That's not exactly ideal."
"I don't think it makes much sense to transfer my shares in the Pilsner Club to a third party in order to return after a year and a half," Paklik made it clear.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, which will end a pat situation in the future.
Two days before the Annual General Meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the Presidency, Miroslav Pelta, promised to make it strong in the event of his election that the FAČR will receive a new statute that will rule out disputes about the electoral order in the future.
The official from Jablonec is confident before Thursday's debate in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will surely dissipate with the eventual success of the Czech elections.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealized election in September that he would like to concentrate on the national team in the event of his election and the acquisition of financial resources.
Only at the last moment did he decide to take part in the election before the last general meeting, and so the two-month break would help him defend his ideas about the direction of football and present his ideas in a broader context.
"People at all levels dedicate themselves to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the president to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time for the association to be directed by someone, the man who is mainly connected to the Jablonec club, but who also worked for many years at Sparta and in the Executive Committee.
He therefore also believes that he has sufficient experience to lead the Czech football team.
He is convinced that today's issues with the election are responsible for the euphoria that existed at the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, statutes were approved at the Annual General Meeting in June, which were not as perfect as they had all been adopted.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman from September," said Pelta.
He used precisely the revision of the most important document of the Citizen's Association as a means of attracting delegates.
"If I should become chairman, I would assume it personally and be prepared to bear personal responsibility if it doesn't work."
"This is a principle without which he cannot be," says Pelta.
Furthermore, he does not try to limit himself to his contrahens.
Earlier he had announced that he could introduce himself to a collaboration with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he acknowledged because of his legal education and he well knows that his opponent was his first deputy.
Tomáš Paclik also did not attack him for a long time, which in turn left no dry thread on Pelta.
In football he has been moving for over a year and can already point to certain successes."
"But his attacks were diminishing and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"That's why many people doubt his real character," Pelta addressed his opponent, who probably remained faithful to his proclamations, which he had already expressed in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest game classes, up to the national team.
And this should be the Czech football hanger.
"I would also try to end all affairs - from the Causa Bohemians to the aftermaths of the corruption scandal of last year."
"After that, I would fall into negotiations with the private and state sector to ensure sufficient funding for the entire football industry," said ČTK, the forty-six-year-old candidate.
At that time he also promised that his entry into the top of Czech football would not mean any personal cleaning.
"I would first have to familiarize myself with the work content of all employees," he said towards Strahov, where, due to the long anarchy, there is apparently nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming general meeting, he believes that the delegates do not go to Nymburk for free on Thursday.
"If really the only disputed point should be, as one chooses in the third round, then we get over it."
"The football needs credibility and the only way to win back is by having a new leader at last," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possibly decisive day of his functional career.
Rajchl promises the FAČR to work hard under him
If the former Vice-Chairman Jindřich Rajchl were to be elected to the new Chairman of the Czech Football Association on Thursday, this would seem to be to the detriment of many people in the Association.
Rajchl promises to start working hard in the event of his choice.
He wants to introduce system changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the case of Bohemians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money into football and otherwise continue the work that the previous chairman Ivan Hašek has begun.
"As chairman, I want to dedicate myself to football as a whole."
Starting from the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, through the national selection, professional football, to performance football for young people."
"I don't want to say that I want to do everything by myself," Rajchl said in a conversation for ČTK.
"I am a team player and would therefore like to distribute the competences in the executive committee in such a way that each member is dedicated to a certain area."
And I will distribute hard tasks so that the football will advance in every segment with milestones."
Many would not be delighted because, instead of just criticizing the work of others, they would have to start working really hard," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, it had been considered not to run at all.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me, who do not throw me unabated lumps between my legs and question every step I take," he said as an explanation of why he hesitated.
"But many people told me that I should not give up, because otherwise it would be others."
"This is trust you can't play," he said.
Apparently, he also motivates him to continue the work he started under Hašek.
"In two years we've done a great deal of work and I don't want to just throw that away."
"There were processes started that might only come into effect in a few years and I would only regret that she stopped someone," he said, expressing his concerns that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would choose to return to the situation in the times before Hašek.
"I believe in systematic action and that is something that Mirek Pelta does not bring."
"Behind him are above all people who would make the football so that he would only be there for those chosen."
I guess you can blame me for a few things, but not that I'm partial."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because everybody is doing well and not just the chosen one," said Rajchl.
He also contradicted the claim that he was only a chairman of the Czechs.
"Even if some people say the opposite, I really intend to do the best possible for ants."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and a Moravian part, whose winners then entered the first league."
"Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league, which is a problem especially for the young players in Moravia," Rajchl says.
Because the head of the Pilsner Club Tomáš Paklik has joined the struggle for the role of chairman, Rajchl does not dare to assess his chances of being elected.
"I feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, who has elected me as its deputy chairman and now recognizes that clear successes are behind me," said Rajchl, who also sees the savings of tens of millions of crowns for unfavorable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations on the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand, he is partly responsible for the fact that the Federation does not draw on a single strand.
While he says of Pelta that "he is disqualified from the outset to help Czech football to new trust," he believes the second rival - Paclik for a strong candidate who really has something to offer the football.
"No one can question that he has done excellent work in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he were to be elected, then he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hašek has started and also the staffing in the Commission would obviously not change in principle."
He wouldn't want to turn things over to his favor," Rajchl judges over his rivals.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump to Blue
By Julia Stanek
Planknecken in Ufo-Optik, Punkpools in Budapest: Those who travel through Europe can experience his blue miracle - and after a city tour or hike rest the tired legs in spasms.
A book shows where wellness in the water is most beautiful.
If Iris Meder went on a research trip for the past one and a half years, one in her luggage could not be missing: her bathing suit.
Looking back on the water, she looked high in artistically designed domes, she swam marble-cutters waiting for them at the edge of the basin, and marveled at carefully restored Art Nouveau swimming pools.
If she had a bath, she took it into her notebook - including interesting details about the building's construction and history.
More than 200 swimming pools explored architectural historian Meder in this way - and now she introduces her in her book "Badefreuden": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historic swimming palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
Through 13 countries she led her "travel to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true swim culture enthusiast.
With sports she doesn't have much on her hat, says Meder - only in the water it's different.
It's a shame that swimmers have to find themselves with blue tiles and chlorine stench, while jogger can smell the enchanting scent of spruce forests inhaling or happy bird scrambler in the park.
"One day I asked myself why swimming pools must always be so ugly," says the Meder living in Vienna.
"So I started to collect beautiful bathrooms."
Water surface doubled architecture
Splatters in the jumping pool and essential sauna oil - the wellness factor in baths is so great because all senses are served, says Meder.
And when the builders have made trouble, swimming pools can be a real eye-smoke: "The base of a floor is a water surface in baths."
"On the one hand, she is transparent, but on the other hand reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything doubles visually: high vaults, colorful tiles, springboards.
The small-format picture band "Badefreuden" on 190 pages conveys interesting information about the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness oasis - but above all makes a desire to jump into the blue.
Remarkably, the pool collector Meder discovered her research in Hungary.
In addition to beautiful spa baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate-containing water in an ancient Karst cave (Cave Bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath, the basins of which are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Spectacular views, on the other hand, offer many heated outdoor baths in Switzerland and Austria: While the entire city is in sight from the Zurich roof bath, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool in St. Anton - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can watch the skiing slopes.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits guests in Längenfeld: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a Ufo that has just landed in the Alps.
From three bowls open up it evaporates in winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal rise in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool, the pool collector Meder took the smell of chlorine to his nose.
Many thermal baths smell like sulphur, in the árpád bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba it smells so strong for heating oil, which is hardly believed to have been landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkaline hydrogen carbonated healing water, which is almost black and whose lick sticks one to the skin as soon as you can slide into the basin - a special kind of wellness experience.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful baths: when she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbathing in the Czech bath Luhatshoewitz, she found a locked terrace.
The bathroom designed by the architect Dušan Jurkovic was closed in 1902.
When Meder threw a look through the weathered windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw how weeds grew between the tiles.
On the other hand, one has counteracted the decay in an enchanting swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three phases of construction are already behind this bath; you can discover not only neo-Romanic elements that come from times of its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favourite pool of the pool-canner Iris Meder - and this is not only because it was originally from the Black Forest.
"It is already an achievement to merge different building styles into such a great unit," says Meder.
At such a palace, the dive in the thermal pool is apparently only minor.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank lets the raw material business shine
By Christian Teevs
Is the Deutsche Bank giving up its business of agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the CEO then wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg -
For the Germans the thing is clear: 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable, according to a study, that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two-thirds of the respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions get out of this business because it increases the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, the author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on the global commodity exchanges push prices up - and the banks therefore have a share of the world's hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is aimed specifically at Deutsche-Bank-Chief Josef Ackermann, even if large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in the same way.
Originally, raw material bets were intended to secure dealers against price fluctuations.
However, most experts now agree that the Zockers have decoupled from supply and demand - and make profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike the U.S. competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to examine the allegations and said that no business was "valued to risk the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an International Working Group is currently examining the allegations of the Foodwatch report.
By the end of the year, the results will be presented to the Executive Board of the Deutsche Bank - together with a recommendation on how to deal with them.
At the end of January, the bank's top wants to announce the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the commodity business, or even the complete withdrawal.
Ackermann builds on his image
Foodwatch Chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time reaffirmed his criticism of the financial industry: "Betting at rising prices of food shows particularly dramatically how reckless banks today damage the general good."
Ackermann is now the top bank lobbyist in particular.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all assets from its portfolio where money is used for betting on food prices," said Bode.
"Whether it is Mr. Ackermann's case of hunger or the reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
The insight of Ackermann comes at first glance surprising, but it is clear that the CEO wants to give a perfect picture just a few months before he leaves office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the CEO will not change to the Supervisory Board otherwise than planned.
With a return from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And in order for him to suffer possible loss, he hardly needs to shave - this would have to do his successor.
Each second would terminate raw material facilities
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager up.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday Bode published the survey for which the Institute Forsa surveyed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Thus, just eleven percent consider it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer facilities that are bet on food prices.
Many banking customers would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such transactions: each second would, according to the survey, terminate all facilities where money flows into the raw material speculation.
43 percent would discourage acquaintances from such a bank, 49 percent said to think about quitting their account and switching to another institution.
21st House in Vienna
The Relocated Pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with heights, depths and happy ending: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels in 1958 received prizes, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and united.
Now he is reopened as an exhibition house.
When modern post-war architecture is flooded with clear shapes, glass halls, courageous swings and new materials, which are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer is a striking and famous example for the Bressler World Exhibition in 1958.
Schwanzer's Pavilion was then given the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its lightweight and floating steel glass construction.
The building is still considered a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He made so famous to the architect that he also built the pavilion at the next World Exhibition in Austria.
With his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus bowling side construction in Munich, he finally became internationally famous in 1973.
After the World Exhibition in the Swiss Garden, his pavilion, which was planned as a temporary exhibition building, was erected at the Viennese South Railway Station and opened in 1962 a 20th century museum - the "20th house" was called it.
But the building was not suitable as a spatial and technical museum - no walls for hanging art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used for so long, until contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001 the building was empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, he is now called "21st House" and will be used as a museum for contemporary art in the future.
On Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition - a happiness in every respect.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, new director of the Austrian Galerie Belvedere in 2007, has taken over the new start.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor of art historian with a considerable career in youth as a figure skater, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, strongly implemented the reconstruction with politicians and monumentists, obtained public funds and private sponsorship funds and determined the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, there should be a café and a bookstore, and an office building had to be built.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the execution, Krischanitz was the ideal occupation.
Not only because he had remodeled and expanded Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna sensibly and won the competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer's University of Technology in Vienna and was the pavilion for him a "very important place" in which he had seen the exhibitions "almost every weekend".
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building that had already lost its generosity and ease in its transition to Vienna and its re-use.
There were far greater problems with the current conversion: the building was "an energy tube," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass façade were replaced, glass fiber-reinforced insulating glass was used and the glass roof was replaced by special safety glass.
Cold bridges steel bearings have been reinforced or replaced and asbestos-filled ceilings have been renovated.
Two undershoots took place for the new use, a sunken light pit between house and street ensures the exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light cock pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house has been painted in the old reddish-brown rust protection color.
And the cinema is even exactly what he used to be.
And all this under the strict supervision of the monumental authority and with a small budget.
"We often had to find a material that is good and cheap and also liked the monumental shelter," says Krischanitz and points to a rough floor on the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and modifications, the building has remained flexible and lightweight.
It was difficult with the pavilion, "that came from Brussels," Krischanitz recently said a typical "drop-in-the-City history".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and nevertheless "will raise a real awareness".
In this case, however, the 21st house is not in the wrong place, because there has been an urban accident: around the Swiss garden there is the newly planned "main station quarter", with office and residential buildings.
And another luck will perhaps come up: the 21st house could get reinforcement from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca of Habsburg bought the Berliner Temporary Kunsthalle, and as one hears, she is already negotiating with the city for a neighboring location in the Swiss garden.
Bahn plans winter crisis package in millions
The railway has developed a crisis plan to prevent train failures in winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train failures and delays, Deutsche Bahn reports that over 70 million euros will be spent in addition this year.
The "picture" newspaper reported in advance, calling for a corporate crisis plan, that by 2015 investments of around 300 million euros were planned.
This should achieve better availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the number of internal and external employees for snow removal on railway systems and rail access to 16,000 people.
The aim is to free platform platforms from snow and ice within four to five hours until the start of operation and 90 percent of the necessary routes.
Two months ago, Railway Chief Rüdiger Grube had warned against train failures and delays after a top meeting with government and industry this winter.
Last winter the train in passenger traffic had considerable problems, as it lacks reserves, among other things, under difficult weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for approval by the Federal Railway Agency for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway has also been creating for years that it has had to test axes of ICE trains significantly more frequently in the workshop after an ICE at the Cologne Hauptbahnhof had an axle break.
Deutsche Bank pays millions of fines in the USA
After the tumult around Josef Ackermann, a new inconvenience comes from the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million fine there.
As if the problems were not enough for Deutsche Bank at home, the industry giants are now also gathering their past in the USA: The Frankfurt Institute pays 145 million dollars in a comparison of EUR (106 million) to settle disputes over the lack of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgage papers.
NCUA, the financial market regulator, proposes a number of large banks to have seduced the cooperative banks with false promises to buy financial products; they would have reduced the risks.
During the financial crisis, such papers have lost their value and have brought banks into the depths.
"We are pleased that we could solve the issue without the parties having to go to court," said a German-Bank spokesman in New York.
The bank did not incur any blame by comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed itself to the payment of 20,5 million dollars.
The NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the reception of the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. cooperative banks and jumps into ploughing to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to replace the resulting billion-dollar damage.
Now the comparisons are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also preoccupied other major banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
The mortgage papers in question are called Mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on mortgages.
When the U.S. real estate bubble exploded in 2007, this became a crime for a variety of financial companies.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers flipped over.
Even if events have been back for a few years, banks are currently blowing a sharp wind in the US.
Investors and regulators have tried countless complaints to obtain repayments or to inquire about failures.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest wave of complaints.
It proposes 18 international major banks to overestimate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's two state-owned real estate financiers in mortgage transactions of about $200 billion in volume.
Deutsche Bank also has to file a complaint against the FHFA, which concerns several transactions worth a total of 14.2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007.
The Supervisory Authority requires Frankfurters to be prepared for "substantial losses" without, however, mentioning a precise sum.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unstoppable and declared that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett increases with 10 billion at IBM
Finanzguru Buffett invests heavily in IBM's IT company.
Since March he has bought up more than ten billion dollars in shares.
So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett had always declared not to invest in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of the companies was only poorly predicted.
Now, however, he has read the annual reports from IBM and changed his opinion on investments in the industry.
He had already had to understand much earlier that IBM primarily provides services and provides computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knighthood in the financial world.
As a result, IBM's IT office may now call itself Sir IBM.
Because Buffett now revealed in the US economy channel CNBC that since March he had bought IBM shares worth 10.7 billion dollars.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus risen to one of IBM's largest shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that not even IBM had known anything about the engagement so far.
He praised the management that even in the economic crisis had made good profits.
"They did a great job," Buffett said about the strategy.
IBM has been relying for some time on lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centers.
The computer pioneer, more than 100 years old, also offers software and advice as well as powerful company computers.
Buffett had so far avoided technology companies.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
Instead, Buffett went for example on a freight train, with a lubricant manufacturer or machine builder.
In addition to around 80 own subsidiaries, his holding Berkshire Hathaway also has shares in a whole range of large corporations such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Municher back.
In the 1960s, the 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and expanded it with smart investments to one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Nevertheless, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost insidious sense of earning money brought him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
According to the announcement of the Buffett investment, IBM's share initially increased by one percent.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, is worth more than 220 billion dollars on the stock market, making it one of the world's most valuable technology companies, along with Apple and Microsoft.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, but he doesn't want to get in.
Founder Bill Gates was a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Zelle", Turkish media doubted the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology", which is now revived.
The murder of eight Turkish tribes and a Greek small businessman between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This news is heard in Turkey and within the German Turkish population in Germany with fear and concern.
For many German-Turkish people, a long-term, dead-belief ghost returns: Since the fire strikes in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence against Turks with a right-wing extremist background.
The fact that there is foreign hostility in Germany was never in question anyway.
However, the detected right-wing extremist network reveals dimensions, the dimension of which is far from foreseeable.
"Is the bloody ideology alive again?" the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
On the other hand, the newspaper "Sabah" emphasises that one of the perpetrators is supposed to have been a V-man of constitutional protection and is concerned that German authorities too may be involved in the right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish community of Germany responded in a sobering manner: it reminded the victims of racist violence with a commemoration in front of the Brandenburg Gate on the weekend.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had in mind a ceremony of the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish acquisition agreement.
In cheerful colours, the two were staged together - as a story of success.
Like an earfight, the coverage of some Turkish media is: "Germany's gift to the fiftieth" is the title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the backgrounds of the murder series.
The German edition of the "Hürriyet" also cannot be taken to draw this thoughtful connection.
"It starts to stink," is the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He stressed that people had been murdered, paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
Extremely critical is being discussed in German Internet forums about the conduct of the police and their subsequent success in the execution of the arrest.
Why it wasn't much the German authorities' intention to look for suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
Some show themselves at least rhetorically prepared for drastic means: "If this continues to be snuffed out, the migrants will be left with nothing but self-defense and arms".
"This will probably be the best self-protection."
"The goodness of the Enlightenment and the adequacy of the punishment of the entire network depends very much on the inner peace in Germany," writes "Selen".
What it means, when inner peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the nineties made clear.
The photo of Solingen's brand ruins is deeply embedded in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event made it clearer to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans that distrust and distance can lead to right violence.
However, the attacks intensified our feelings on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the past error
In the Turkish press, the failure of German politics was mainly blamed after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After Solingen's fire attack, he sent an accompaniment chart to the Turkish President, but was represented by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel at the Cologne wedding ceremony - Kinkel recorded in his speech how many charges the Turks made.
Quite so, as the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of its taxes.
The current coverage of Turkish media shows once again how deep the distrust of many German Turks has been in the present rule of law ever since.
In addition to the efforts of a comprehensive clarification and reassessment of the right-wing extreme terrorism in Germany, we need open words this time.
The scandal bank of the Zürisee
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not located in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
In the financial crisis, UBS has been almost bankrupt and has been slipping from a crisis to the next.
Now it's for a German to judge.
Axel Weber probably didn't think of that.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank, it was announced in July that in 2013 he would start a nearly as spectacular new job: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber welcomed herself publicly, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its new solidity and let friendly comments about future colleagues fall.
"The UBS has made the turnaround."
"I am looking forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
But already in September it became clear that everything would come quite differently.
A retailer of UBS in London had bypassed all of the bank's security systems and had ingested around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS Chief Executive Officer Oswald Grübel, a not only famous banker in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of UBS has also been regarded as being beaten - and everyone asks: When is Axel Weber finally coming?
It has already been announced that Weber may consult the bank from February 2012.
And he is already taking over the Chairmanship of the Board of Directors in May - not only in 2013, as the Bank announced on Tuesday.
This becomes hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, he is a professor of economics and bankers, and he would certainly have needed a period of work.
With one blow, he then assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has just proved once again that it has long earned the title of "the largest scandal bank in Europe".
For, on the one hand, the UBS is huge - until recently it was the world's largest asset manager - and, on the other hand, it has been slipping from a scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, saves the once proud Swiss bank.
It began in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the silent and solid, but also brittle Swiss asset managers had combined it with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become a very large number in investment banking.
Thus, in 2007, the UBS managed, on the one hand, with 1.6 trillion dollars, more money customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, as an investment bank, she was advanced to the league of the largest banks in the world.
That made an impression.
The former banker and later long-standing bank professor in Zurich Hans Geiger says: "I always presented the UBS to my students as a model of a good bank at that time."
"From today's point of view, you ask yourself, "How could I be so wrong?"
He was very wrong.
In 2007, it became apparent for the first time that something went wrong in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, Chief Executive Officer Peter Wuffli resigned surprisingly, who was then considered a highly intellectual and equally brilliant banker.
A few months later, one wondered why he had gone.
The bank's investment division had been stoked with subprime papers and had to write off billions.
In order to boost this, UBS announced a capital increase of say and write 13 billion francs.
In fact, she found investors for this, but some of them who had humiliated their noses until shortly before: an intransparent Asian State Fund from Singapore and an Arab State Fund, which was so distant that they did not even know their name.
But that was just the first blow.
It got worse in April 2008.
The bank had to announce new billion losses, President Marcel Ospel, the second-paid Board of Directors of Switzerland, in 2006.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: UBS faced the financial crisis and had to be rescued by the state because of its misinvestment in the financial crisis.
The National Bank purchased UBS for ten billion problematic securities, and the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a forced change loan, which she could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - because she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it houses such big banks.
Finally, the balance sheet total of UBS 2007 was more than five times as large as the Swiss economic performance (see graph).
"Now we couldn't save the UBS," says bank researcher Geiger.
The first disaster was the second one.
Within a few months the UBS surrendered in the tax dispute with America and agreed to release the data of wealthy customers who may have been taxed with the help of the bank.
In addition, she agreed to a payment of 780 million dollars - as repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions, including penalty payments.
Thus, the UBS knew more or less openly to have helped with tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in competition for rich customers: the nimbus of silence.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the Executive Board and the Chairman of the Board.
And the exodus of customer money.
Thus, within a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in both central business segments: investment banking through misconceptions and asset management through tax evasion assistance.
And just when it got a bit quieter again, just as you thought, now the UBS will get it back to you, as this unsavory dealer story follows: A single dealer choked up 1.7 billion euros before the bank notices that something is going wrong.
And it is obvious that the risk management in investment banking is still obviously not working.
"With the case of Adoboli, one has to find that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and financial professor at the University of Zurich's Bank Institute.
The financial director of a large German bank is also confident: "The problem of UBS is that it does not control risk control."
It was precisely the idea of the caution with which the Swiss bankers had come a long time ago to become custodians of the world's great assets: no too great risks, for security of money - even beyond the Alpine Republic, it would break down the world once.
The Tresores of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of unshakable reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
The headquarters of the UBS in Zurich still fit the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank - it's just a bit bigger.
Already the situation is classic.
The bank has its headquarters at the Zurich Railway Station, which leads from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are magnificent, the store rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellery like Tiffany's can be found here between Swiss traditional shops such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries, Swiss banks have resided here: from the National Bank to the palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The reception hall of the UBS is accessed by a heavy turning door.
Inside the walls are marble dressed, before which there is thick leather armchair, next to the bank logo a great sign for the "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has forced both Swiss major banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at some point it has been dispelled - or betrayed, as the boss of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, and finally, like all Swiss bankers, he does business with the two major banks.
The UBS had become far too big, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the fishing axes had also spread.
The Swiss had nothing more to say there.
"And if so, they have long adapted to the manners of the angels."
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking, which changed the UBS, first gave it high profits and then the Debacle: No European financial institution has lost as much money in the sub-prime jungle as the Swiss big bank.
The disaster became visible on 15 October 2008.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven million nation decided on the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs, or about 45 billion euros, have allowed politicians to save the big bank in the face of bankruptcy.
How could it have come about?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, you see the problem especially in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks joined a huge group.
There was a bank that was already too big in the merger for the small Switzerland - and grew more and more.
It helped to complement the two different predecessor banks of UBS: a rich but sleepy bank with the focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer but even more internationalized.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment banks came to a great deal of money with which they could spin a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, Chairman of the Board of Directors at that time.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Orpel were a dream team," says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high-intellectual, humble who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the belly-man who has worked himself up from banking to the top."
But at the end of the day, Orpel depended on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake at the end: "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It is clear: Superstition came before the case.
Employees of the UBS are clearly reminded of the executive meetings, on which CEO Wuffli repeatedly issued the same Parole edition: Goldman Sachs of the Throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank on earth.
She led the "League Tables", the rankings that documented the success of the banks of that time.
That's where the UBS wanted to go, right up there.
You've already succeeded in a few steps.
She played at the very top in the foreign exchange business and in the stock trade.
However, corporate advisors who were commissioned highlighted a weakness: in the international interest rate business, in the banking language "Fixed Income", there is a huge distance from the largest banks.
The UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS went into an adventure that cost her almost the existence.
Hungry after growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund founded before it invested in subprime American facilities.
She developed into a huge machine that packaged and extended securities on American mortgage loans - but also kept risks.
Also, when other banks long ago sought the exit.
"Up until the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was in flames, UBS bought it," says banker expert Geiger.
So big the euphoria, so deep the fall.
One manager after another had to go when the attempts to clean up were more difficult than thought.
Posts at the UBS have become sleigh seats and are still fragile.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank that has bypassed all of the nearby business models.
Banking researcher Geiger already has an idea: end with investment banking, focus on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.
The bank does not (yet) want to go that far.
But the investment banking is supposed to shrink sharply, so much is now clear.
Next Thursday, the new bank manager Sergio Ermotti will present his future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italo brother-in-law was actually only thought of as a transitional solution, when the bank was surprisingly separated from previous pitfalls.
In the meantime, he has asserted: He is to conduct the business of UBS on a permanent basis, the Zurich Bank announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to move the investment bank back to the middle of the nineties.
He strokes 3,500 places.
But that won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money for?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is probably asking himself now.
Publicly, he's just saying that he's going to start looking for an apartment with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe burdened US stock exchange
The threatening recession in Europe has taken the courage of the US investors at the start of the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained unbeatable.
The threat of industrial production on the continent suffocated hopes of stabilising the debt crisis in the germ.
The general relief of the change of government in Rome and Athens could not be enforced.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass had been half full in the past week, not half empty - but now the problems became the foreground again, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Financial values were mainly included in the sales notes.
The Dow Jones index of the standard values recorded for the closing of the trade with a minus of 0.6 percent at 12,078 points.
In the course of trade, the market barometer ranged between 12.027 and 12.170 points.
The wider S&P-500 index closed at 1251, a minus one percent.
The Nasdaq technology exchange index lost 0.8 percent and went out of trading with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax passed with a minus of 1.2 percent at 5985 meters.
The industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced its production and is focusing on the end of the upturn.
Enterprises produced two per cent less in September than in the previous month, as reported by the Eurostat Statistical Office.
The US investors were sceptical about this: "We are not an island, we are dependent on it," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to get out of recession so quickly, and there will be further signs of weakness in banks.
Warren Buffett's investment legend only confirmed this caution: It is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything for an end to the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
That is why it is too early to invest in European government bonds or banks from his point of view.
Instead, Buffett threw an old principle over the pile for decades and entered the U.S. technology industry.
His investment over more than ten billion dollars in IBM supported the share price of the traditional group and initially had him record against the trend in the course of trade just one percent higher.
The paper was almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett paid an average of 170 dollars per piece according to his own data and now holds 5.5 percent.
The share price of its investment company Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
The Bank of America's shares were significantly higher than the market with 2.6 percent.
The house silverifies almost the entire rest of its shares in the China Construction Bank and adds $6.6 billion to it.
With the net profit from the business, the institution wants to topple its capital ratio and thus comply with tougher regulatory requirements.
The aircraft builder Boeing increased and thereby limited the losses in Dow.
The share gained 1.5 percent after the Group had collected the largest order in its history.
Airline Emirates ordered 50 long-distance machines of type 777 on Sunday and calculated the value of the order to 18 billion dollars.
Including options on 20 other machines, the volume even amounts to 26 billion dollars.
At the New York Stock Exchange, around 710 million shares changed ownership.
719 values increased, 2281 remained stable, and 79 remained unchanged.
At Nasdaq, sales of 1.38 billion shares 630 in the plus, 1913 in the minus and 82 unchanged.
Intelligent crows spread in cities
In many places, seed crows are considered "problem birds": However, from the cities the highly intelligent animals are long gone, experts claim.
One likes them, the other wants to get rid of them very quickly: Crowds have been part of the city for centuries, but in many municipalities resident complaints arise about the dirt and noise of the animals.
A means against the "problem birds" has not yet been in sight.
Saat crows were no longer to get out of the cities, experts said at the first crow's symposium in the East Frisian void.
There, experts from all over the federal territory are talking about possible ways out.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
Naturalists also brought the problems in cities to bear on the land-trafficking of the particularly protected seeds: the chemical use in agriculture increasingly destroys traditional habitats.
Hunting, growing cultivation and the fall of typical breeding trees made life difficult for birds.
Crowds are protected by nature.
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs can be found in the Westfalian Soest, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There, in 2005, a controversial project for the mass killing of crows in the district had taken care of negative lines.
Critics had described the catching of the animals in bird traps and the killing with knuckles as particularly brutal.
"The normal displacement, the grumbling, brings nothing," the city and landscape planner Werner Klöver found out of emptiness.
Spraying nests with water or falling trees, often has undesirable consequences, also said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals depart, large colonies split up and spread in other places."
Excavation is only possible as an exception to hospitals, old-age homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them out of here."
Without the surrounding area the problem cannot be solved in the cities, Mayor Wolfgang Kellner said from Leer.
It can be thought that a combination of the animals’ fronts of sensitive living areas and lockers are available to relocate them to other places.
"Information boards instead of chainsaws" opposed the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens for a completely different way of dealing with the animals: "In the end, we can bear a prick in the face best self-consciously."
In Schleswig-Holstein, Jürgens had co-founded the Ascheberger Krähen-Tehrpfad, which informs us about the life of highly intelligent seed cows.
The project is now already being adopted by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion on the criticism of the noise of birds: "There is a lot of communication that they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: seed cows not only use tools to get to a treat, but even produce their tools themselves as an aid.
Behavioral researchers from Cambridge University recently tested four seed cows how far the intelligence of birds reaches.
In an experiment, the birds learned quickly that they had to crash a scaffold with stones to get to a moth larvae.
Without much training, they recognized the target size and shape that a stone must have in order to collapse the platform.
In a second attempt, the crayfish then had to solve a more difficult problem.
In a vertical cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larvae.
With the beak, the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had laid wire pieces for them.
From this all four animals formed a hook, with which they then obtained the bucket at the handle from the tube.
Three of the four seeds were even able to do so.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal for EM 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks for a coup remained.
The favorites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will be at the 2012 EM.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have solved the last tickets to the 2012 European Championships in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Located by the double successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8, 53.), Portugal struck Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth consecutive EM-participation perfect after the 0.0.
The Czechs reached a 1:0 (0.0) in the play-off-back game with Montenegro outside, after the play-off (2.0) had already been a clear thing.
There was no more burning of Croatia in the 0.0 against Turkey, Ireland brought a loose 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72, 82) and Miguel Veloso (80) scored the other hits for Portugal.
The former Wolfsburger Bundesliga-Profi Zvjezdan Misimovic with a transformed trademeter (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) had twice reduced for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red card (54.).
Bosnia had already failed to Portugal in the 2010 World Cup playoffs in South Africa.
In the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal caught a start by measure.
Ronaldo chased a free shot from about 30 meters to the early lead into the meshes.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his scores and met at 2:0 from 25 metres.
The Bosniars, who did not take place in the first half of the hour, had their first clear chance through goal hunter Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger from the English leader Manchester City put a head ball at the base of the bar, but the ball did not exceed the goal line (33).
Jiracek meets Czech Republic
Afterwards, arbitrator Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was in the center.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penitentiary, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36.).
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial trade meter after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which Misimovic certainly changed.
But after the break, the 2004 Vice-European Champion made it clear with four hits.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek ended the last doubts in the 81st minute.
In 1976, the European Champion went to the EM for the fifth time in a row.
The team of Trainer Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga legionaries Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nürnberg) were also lucky and had to pass a startling second.
The finalist Petr Cech, with a reflex at the last moment, prevented a possible home gate by Tomas Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had its greatest opportunities when the Duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot in the 40th minute from the rotation of the boundary of the penalty space just past the gate of Cech.
After the break, the crossbatten had to save for the Czech world class tower already beaten, again the storm of the FC Seoul had pulled off (50.).
After all, the gate just before the end made everything clear.
Turkey thus missed Zagreb's football wonder.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not get beyond a 0:0.
While National Trainer Guus Hidddink will have to clear his place on the 2002 World Cup Third Bank, the Croatians can be pleased about their fourth participation in an EM round.
Before 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost caught a dream start.
Selcuk Inan hit only the post in the seventh minute with a distance shot, attacker Kazim Kazim could not even sink the impactor in the gate.
After the horror period, however, Croatia became more and more in control.
Even after the break, the Croats didn't burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who took place from the 62nd minute for the Dortmunder Ivan Perisic, the Bundesliga-Legionaire Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in use.
Trapattoni drives to the EM
In Dublin, the Irish have been celebrating the first EM-participation since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward brought the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision with the 4:0 success in the run-up, in the 32nd minute in charge.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) awarded to the guests.
Ireland had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian side of the team prevent the possible leader.
In the 32nd minute, however, it was time.
After a failed defense from finalist Pavel Londak, Ward was on position and pushed the ball to 1:0 above the line.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software manufacturer SAP invests billions in China over the next few years and wants to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, the Dax Group announced about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) to flow.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and employ corresponding employees," announced Co-Chif Bill McDermott at a customer fair in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from around 2500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of locations of the world market leader in business software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Around 4,000 of the world's more than 176 000 SAP customers sit in the Boomland.
The growth plans in China are also an important component of the 2015 strategy of the Dax Group.
SAP wants to increase sales to 20 billion euros by 2015.

Currently, the business of the software provider, who employs 55,000 people worldwide, is running almost rarely before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our activities (...)", McDermott explained.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China based on comprehensive information."
Mass slaughter at a personal level
Emotional and generous, Peter Englund's new book "Beautiful and Scary. A story of the First World War, tells in nineteen fates" with a long list of main characters that go to your heart.
Here's a tip on how to do this: Cut this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people very well in English Romantic narrative. And these main characters will function as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments in which you are lost like English men and women in the fog of war and deprived of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He has written an unusual book that he does not describe as "a work of anti-history".
It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly any ambassadors, furious reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It's less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was". It's about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and apprehension" almost all the war experiences of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war together, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountain climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go crazy or die.
Each of these lives flashes like the votive candles in a church, some are added while others extinguish.
Englund's book differs from the usual history books.
It also corrects the notion that the First World War was only the devastating war of position on the West Front.
"Beauty and apprehension" wanders with expert views of other places of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
On the soldiers in this book fall beehives, a festive Christmas among the pyramids in Egypt, tsets flies are an unresolvable problem.
This is almost from the beginning a moving book.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina, who smells like Kordit.
Imagine you're a woman who's home with her children and hears cannon fire in the distance.
Who's even coming?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being waged at all.
"Feeling facts," says Englund, "were furnished with suspicions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and apprehension" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German ship's sailor.
Their stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other material already published.
Their life reports can be terrifying or touching, but they are extremely alive in Englunds of the detail-losing collection of small moments.
Many of them act of defiance and help themselves.
In the story of a German schoolgirl, he says, "Replacement, everywhere replacement."
"Replacement coffee, false aluminum, false eraser, paper compounds, wooden buttons."
He tells more about replacement dinner in Germany.
He describes "meat made of pressed rice and baked in lamb's fat (and last served with a false bone made of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato peels, shoes that were coated with wood."
There were, as he noted, "837 registered food substitutes, which were allowed in the production of sausages, 511 recorded coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
One American recognizes his own desire for ferocity and says about the war: "One feels that, despite all that, what was intended for men rather than sitting in the chair, with the evening leaf or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in the hand, and to do so as meaning such a facade civilization and as if there were no barbarians behind his own strengthened and beaten shirt breast."
Conversely, a British soldier recognizes that he is likely to die and that no one will take note of it or take care of it.
"If you take a break from the thought of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that this happens to an audience," he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as "a condemned man who was hanged in the secret."
Other observations are from the old Europe, which is falling apart, and about new kinds of terror.
"The conflict became increasingly an economic competition," writes Englund, "a war between factories."
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the still young century": "the word turned and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a scale suit that slaughters while he is sitting behind a desk."
People behave in unforeseen ways and there is as peaceful behavior as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to infect themselves in a prostitute with a sexual disease to escape the front service.
"The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in trade with gonococci-Eiter, because soldiers bought and lubricated on their genitals, hoping to get to the hospital like this," he writes.
"Those who were truly desperate, they rubbed him in the eyes, causing them to be blind to the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund's poetry is smooth and yet unobtrusive and adapts perfectly to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way the war "uncontrollable forces were unleashed in a unique way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People begin to ask themselves why their leaders bring them to battle.
The best books on the First World War were usually more distorted like Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels such as Erich Maria Remarques "In the West nothing new" than extensive history books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating ending I've ever read in a book.
I'm not giving it back.
But it's as if with his book, he'd snap this side away with the main characters in front of his nose and lighted us with a match wood.
After an early misstep a minute planned assault
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing helmets.
One had decided for the night from Monday to Tuesday because at this time there are hardly any people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-ranking officials were informed. All others believed in an exercise at first.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence underlined the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of recent weeks such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violates the rules of the department and gave the houseowners an enormous increase in public sympathy, were no longer allowed to repeat.
And so the police action to remove the protesters from the Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared these by observing how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randall's Island.
Officials reinforced the so-called chaos training - measures to combat terrorism, including the rapid deployment of a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The command to move into the park came "at the last minute," said someone who is familiar with the commands, which meant "exercising".
"The few policemen involved in my knowledge didn't know it was about Zuccotti Park," said someone who wanted to remain anonymous.
"The only ones who knew it was about the Zuccotti Park were the senior officials of the resort."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson the city had learned.
On October 14th, officials wanted to clear the park, but then departed when hundreds of protesters came together after they had learned about these plans.
Officials of various police units were involved in the Tuesday operation, including emergency services from all over the city - hundreds of mobile officials who are usually used in high-criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day many people go into the park and out, almost like commuters, so that 1 o'clock in the night is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do this when the smallest number of people in the park stopped," he said.
Rescue cars with Jupiter lights and loudspeakers were ready before the departure at Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the prerecorded news coming out of the speakers seemed to intimidate many Protestants.
When the public officials stepped into their light blue wind jackets in the park, many protesters simply gathered their things together and left the place.
The police said that by 1:45 p.m., no tents would be touched to give the protesters time to pack up their possessions and possessions.
Other teams of officials were seen gathering in the area to intervene, arrests in the park should become necessary.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesperson of the police president, said this had happened to their own security.
But many journalists claim that they wanted to stop them from watching police action in the park, and they said that the handling of the officials was very rough.
Mr. Browne said that TV cars on Church Street could have taken photos on the west side of the park.
When the police moved to the West by the big mess of personal things of the Protestants, including suitcases, artificial grass and clothes with clothes, their employees followed the city cleaning, which had been lifted, which had been abandoned.
Some protesters who refused to go were dragged outside. Pictures of this were released on the Internet a short time later.
A main core of protesters moved near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park position.
Some built barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp were linked to their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Civil servants were called to cut them off.
As Mr Kelly said, no arrests were carried out in the park until about 3:30.
The room was closed after 75 minutes from the police.
Mr. Browne said 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most arrests came, as he said, due to "irregular behaviour and resistance to arrest".
The most prominent official on site was Joseph J. Esposito, head of the department, the highest uniformed official in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the police department, was there too.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly "did not conduct the operation", as Mr. Browne said.
In case they should access, a second group of officials waited on the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
In Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and in Pine Street, a block further south, barricades were built.
It could be observed how these police sites continued to extend the surrounding area around Zuccotti Park.
In one place was observed as several officials, many of them with signs of protection, drove persons outside.
About 28 people were in the northern perimeter.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
At 5 p.m. south of Pine Street, a protester jumped onto the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators let the air out of the tire of a police bus.
In one place the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, an official and a protester came to the hospital.
Trade union of the caregivers will file a complaint against the city for redundancies
The union, representing hundreds of school staff who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, as the redundancies are not necessary and discriminatory due to their inadequate influence on the schools teaching poor students.
The complaint is probably the last opportunity open to the trade union, district council 37, in its efforts to reverse redundancies.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, care coordinators and other staff who were among the worst paid employees in the city and had lost their job on October 7th, described the trade union leader as political revenge for refusing access to a health fund held by the working groups to which the budget gap should be closed.
This accusation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the City Council, Dennis M. Walcott, Director of Schools, said last month that the redundancies were part of the budget that was adopted in June.
A member of the City Council shot back and told him that in the budget nothing specified that employees would be released from school assistance.
Officers of the City Council 37 said they had and warned the Ministry of Education about a lawsuit. On Wednesday there will be a press conference to formally announce the filing of the suit before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The complaint will be brought by Mr Walcott and the Ministry of Education of the City as defendants and eight dismissed workers as plaintiffs, all of whom are colored or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesperson of the city's Ministry of Justice, said that the city was not in a position to file a complaint and thus their individual claims could not be commented on.
According to a draft complaint submitted by the New York Times, the union focused on the number of redundancies at the schools in the poor areas of the city to support a lawsuit for unequal treatment. It claims that poor schools had lost more help because they were chronically underfunded.
She explains that while there were no redundancies on Staten Island and only a few redundancies in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school helpers lost in the 23rd district of Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 helpers were released in the 8th and 9th districts of the South Bronx.
With the finding of the loss of five out of eight school helpers who were employed in public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of the students live in poverty, the complaint states: "This is not a neighborhood of notorious parents who can organize donations to collect budget cuts."
P.S.: The 36th district budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year. In addition, money was lost when the city changed its method of calculating the extra funding for each poor school enrolment.
The union also complains that the leaders of the High Schools were led by the language in a memo into the error which authorized the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even though "excess" (translating German) in the US usually describes the change of a teacher from a school's salary list to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six co-ordinators were dismissed, not transferred," says the draft.
Mission finished, Congress ready to communicate with Libya
Finally, it looks as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already agreeing on the uprisings in Libya.
All that was necessary for this was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of the long-standing dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate's Committee for International Relations decided on a resolution, which is submitted to the Chairman John Kerry (Massachussetts) together with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for the successful rebellion and the US troops for their "mute".
"This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who have begun rebuilding their country," said Kerry.
"It is a confirmation of the support of its democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been simply in the Libyan debate.
This summer, the legislators of both parties and the White House argued about the choice of words for a number of resolutions to approve or disapprove the role of the US military in the Libyan mission of NATO.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution which approved the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a broad margin group of both parties and there was no vote.
But on the same day, this law was passed in the Senate, and the board also passed a decision to cut the money for American operations in Libya.
As a result, the U.S. mission came into a kind of legislative purgatory - with a congress that was brought up enough to criticise Obama's approach within the scope of the mission, but not angry enough to finally pull him off the floor under his feet.
Then the indecisiveness of Congress was overtaken by the events.
Tripolis fell in August among the Libyan rebels and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "gratulates Libya's people with their enormous courage and exceptional perseverance in their own liberation" and "glorifies the men and women of the US military and their coalition partners who support military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition from Libya to democracy".
Will the new measures be fully supported by the Board of Foreign Relations or will they split the legislators as it did the Law of June?
The last version is based on the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the committee's leading republican.
Lugars spokesperson said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Capitol, it is up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional change that calls for a balanced budget to be a top priority in almost every congressional legislative period of Republicans and some democrats.
The measures under the direction of Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change of the budget or another area to be voted in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far tried unsuccessfully to bring their changes to a vote, although they have often tried it enough.
Goodlatte's amendment is only one of 68 constitutional changes that have been presented to this Congress and include a wide range of topics.
Some are double - the same law has been presented to both Congress and the Senate - others only slightly deviate from each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the compensation budget change in the Senate alone and another dozen that would "control federal spending".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients - especially beginners to Republicans who want to polish their CVs - the possibility of boasting that they have "written" such a measure.
The Budgetary Control Act, adopted in August, requires both Senate and Congress to vote on a change in the budgetary balance.
In March, 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of the Congress can present, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to lift the ban to two of the president's term.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments which guarantee, among other things, the right to good education and health care.
A change that prohibits marriage among genders is, as well as a change that prohibits the burning of flags, a recurring template.
Some legislators also want to allow the abolition of federal laws if two-thirds of the states refuse to do so.
As zealously as Members propose amendments, they move at the same rate as in recent years.
In the 111th Congress, legislators presented 77 such changes in the 110th Congress 66.
The pace fades compared to that of the early 1990s in which members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment to add - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but was actually proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Founded, but not defeated," said Giffords in the first television interview after the attack
Ten months after an armed man had shot at her from a distance during an election in Tucson, Republican Gabrielle Giffford (Arizona) appeared on national television on Monday night. She alone sang to the Broadway section "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to recover would be greater than the desire to return to the congress.
When she joined Diane Sawyer in the ABC news "20/20", she ranked according to words and needed help in walking.
The mission showed the heavy slow recovery of the damage that the bullet, which shared its skull, pierced the left side of its brain and crossed its head from front to back.
Three months ago, she returned to Congress surprisingly to give her triumphant voice to the debt brake.
In her first television interview after the attack in January, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "hard".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford replied (41): "Very well."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20/20" special, recorded shortly before the publication of the new book of the couple: "Gabby: A story about courage and hope."
The special pursues Gifford's recovery since the attack of January 8.
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first few weeks, they were seen in the hospital bed, with a bald shaved head and a long scarf above the forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair, while therapists show her how to make simple movements.
A nick with his head.
A tickle with the lip.
And then, their first words, "What?"
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: "Toast". She wants her breakfast changed.
Videos played in the ABC show show show that music played an important role in Gifford's recovery: one sees how congressmen sing "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" together with therapists of Cyndi Laupers and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'".
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours of therapy every day, said she can't remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband said that on March 12 he had read an article in a daily paper about the assassination when she interrupted him and for the first time asked about the six people who had been killed during the assassination.
The suspected shooter Jared Lee Loughner is in a Missouri prison and is treated medically while awaiting his trial.
"Many people died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
As his wife recovered, Kelly Sawyer said, "I was hit."
"So, I'd say, "Gabby, you weren't defeated," Kelly said.
You just got hit.
And you'll get through this and you'll get better and you'll come back more than ever.
The troops feel more pity than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala collecting millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
One hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots, and marines gathered around him.
The crowd in black tuxedos stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the donation campaign in the spring.
A senior military officer on the Gala, who was observed, among other things, by the Chief of Staff and then Chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced as orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant it well.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, really not. It was pity.
The harsh contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are being overrun with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its price, civil servants say.
The public is increasingly acting like you were suffering the people in uniform.
"We were by no means victims," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who ordered troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently, the only way to help is to push us into the role of unhappy souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to be ungrateful or in dispute with the public they serve.
They also realized that the anger of the returning troops in recent years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, talks about pity in the silence and private between war veterans take place.
After his two sons returned from combat with the Marines, Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would view them with a sense of awe as they defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if a "wrathing, violent veteran was hiding beneath the surface," said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and had taken over an elevated state post in Washington after his return.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the respondents subtly asked if he was able to withstand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington immediately after his return from the fight.
"If you talk about your ministry, you have to hold the negative impressions against it," explained Cancian to his sons.
The lack of lightness of the military partly rooted in the lack of interest of Americans in the war.
Services on the battlefield are rarely taken out as praise by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We as a nation no longer appreciate military heroism as it was in the Second World War," said Lieutenant General David Barno a.D., who ordered US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public focuses largely on the suffering of a servant.
Forces are recognized for the number of attacks they have suffered, the number of friends they have lost or for the severity of their injuries.
Military forces are putting up with the growing pressure to perpetrate rape
This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 women and men are being charged with non-intervention in a rape before the military court.
Should it not be possible, hundreds of plaintiffs will be available for the next hearing.
Liberated Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11th week pregnant when she was raped by a soldier colleague at night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague who carried a 12-pack beer with her.
He asked her if he could accompany her for a drink in her room.
"My alarm bells started," said Lyman.
But the Texan lady wiped out her concerns.
I thought, "Oh, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I had heard my gut feeling."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man stepped behind her, pushed her down and raped her, claiming she was.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel anxiously await a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, deciding whether a lawsuit they have filed against the former Minister of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld.
The complaint claims that Gates and Rumsfeld have not acted against the widespread rape within the military and against the constitutional right of the soldiers.
In February of Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C. filed, the lawsuit initially involved 17 plaintiffs who, however, rose to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men, all of whom claim to have been raped or sexually abused by soldiers’ colleagues, and that the military failed to determine, condemn or provide an adequate case-law following the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's following the top military leadership, as the problem started there.
"The military is hierarchical," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in the position to eradicate the cultural retaliation of the? The leadership."
Burke also says that since February she has contacted almost 400 other survivors, many of them could be part of future lawsuits.
Their strategy: Instead of all the plaintiffs placing their eggs in a basket, they will, if necessary, file many further complaints to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Ministry of Defense, led by state attorney Neil MacBride, has filed an application to dismiss the suit.
The documents of the Court of Justice, which are available for Newsweek, are followed in detail by the defence strategy, primarily by the fact that the military cannot be charged with any current or former military indictment of any violation to which it has come in the armed forces.
According to a law of the Supreme Court of 1950, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries committed to active soldiers.
"The alleged damage occurred during the military service of the plaintiffs," says the document.
The Ministry of Defence refuses any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in battle, then the distinction is only in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan, soldiers' teams play increasingly important roles, especially in contact with local women in the war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 soldiers died, two thirds of them in combat.
It's time for the military to be modernized, says Burke.
And she does not stand alone in her struggle, three more lawsuits besides them.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four most important military academies for suspected promotion of a feminist atmosphere.
Of this, the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America independently filed a complaint against the military, focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorder" which received rape victims to release them from service - a common approach according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December her group filed a complaint against the Veterans Administration (i.e.: administration of the war veterans) in which she accused her discriminatory practices in dealing with performance claims for persons who indicated that they had been sexually abused in service.
Nine laws were presented independently of each other by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties to the Congress, which offers a number of clues.
In 2010, according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (i.e., the Office for Prevention and Announcement of Sexual Abuse) of the Ministry of Defense, 3,158 sexual abuses were reported.
However, most abuses are not reported at all and according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure takes into account about 13.5% of the estimated 19,000 cases per year.
The report, published in March, also examines the criminal prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases recorded in the military were brought to court, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burkes' case describe their attacks as just the first series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the suspected rape of the military police less than an hour after the attack.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape of a number of policemen, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape kit and the blood of her attacker, who came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During this hearing, she was asked for the sex she had before the assault with her friend.
Six persons spoke as witnesses in the name of the suspected perpetrator, who was finally acquitted.
"I still remember well the day the verdict was read," says Lyman.
"I thought the troubles would start. I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They took me to the psychiatric ward and I remember when I came out again, I said to my commander, "That wasn't his procedure. That was my procedure."
Lyman was invited to visit a military psychiatrist who finally diagnosed a personality disorder and declared it incapacitated.
In January 2010, she was unfairly released, so she received no support.
Whether the case, the Lyman and the other plaintiffs filed progresses is pure speculation, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he says, "In my opinion, they should move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine, which has been criticized since it was first questioned.
I'm a critic of the Feres doctrine.
The military is lagging behind for a decade because they do not have the same incentive and the same deterrent that brings liability.
He adds: "The chances are against them... but it is important for them to try."
These things will only change when good people are ready to fight.
If the hearing does not follow its path, Burke, the lawyer of the plaintiffs, will begin with their hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this respect until there are reforms," she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Watch You On Facebook
Before becoming a new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was only one of many guys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to having done an amok run in Norway in July, at which 77 people were killed, had his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is by far not alone in cyberspace: he has spent a lot of time in front of his computer until his attack and blackmailed with some of the millions of nationalists who support out-of-right groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find it?
This is easy - you just need to log in on Facebook.
"We have found that it was not difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report by the British idea factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook's hiding personal data is so encyclopaedic, Bartlett says that the researchers simply need to use the site's advertising tool to accurately determine their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - just as marketers have for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans on the right all over Europe and then approached them with add-ons, but instead of linking up with a new band or a new diet product, the add-ons invited users to a survey asking for their educational status, their attitude towards violence and the assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to question more than 10,000 supporters of 14 top right parties in 11 European countries - without even having to leave their office.
"It's a rather new research method," Bartlett says.
Some of the results hardly surprise. Online promoters right-wing extreme groups are mostly young, male and annoyed about immigration.
But in a sort of surprising twist are "those who combine their online activism with an offline activism more rational, democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screens."
DEMO's work is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideas factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything, from health issues to societal trends such as "Likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users who add three content per day on average, Facebook's "Data Supernova" generates a research boom that increased the number of scientific works with the name of this page in the title by nearly 800% over the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study through this site people that you usually don't reach with your clipboard on the street.
"If you tried earlier to question people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first and it would never have allowed them access," Bartlett says.
"With Facebook it all falls away - you go directly to them."
Others say that the site offers an opportunity to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their full noise on Facebook are significantly more inclined to drink problems than students who are silent on this topic.
Moreno suggests that equal-level students, such as residential consultants, monitor the page and help a student when they post too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at Children's Research Institute in Seattle, Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children who would not have been found otherwise."
Facebook also constantly collects the data of its own population.
The site's data team has created statistics on the relationship status and Valentine's Day, election participation in the 2010 intermediate elections and a National Lucky Index (which mainly used data that only Facebook has access to - Digital Freedom Masters have long known that the site should make its large data fund available for other research purposes.)
However, the users of Facebook know that the page watches them whether they want to or not. In order to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you allow the site to provide its own personal data.
But what if the users of Facebook become part of a survey they don't even know about?
While researchers have strictly defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, everything online is allowed.
"I don't think many users have ever thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, for a 2006 study in which he examined the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As far as she was concerned, it was just about her and her friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook it is impossible to know how many of the information in a user profile and in contributions are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," Selwyn says.
Thus, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research needs to take care of social issues - and a lot of social life is still happening offline."
"Calt and Inhumane": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time in a public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed two amok races in which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" fighter.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple knight in Norway," he said in front of a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support hateology and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the laws, but I don't blame myself."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue, as he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he could express his views."
For the same reason, he refused Breivik, who gave a speech previously written, permission to turn to the members of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered that the police keep Breivik under investigation for 12 weeks, that he has no access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will closely monitor all visits and all correspondence over eight weeks.
Approximately 30 survivors and victims participated in the hearing.
Some came in hopes of seeing Breivik in sight, others wanted confirmation that he was behind locks and bars.
Everyone participated with the goal that everything would go to a loophole.
"I thought he was cold and inhuman," a survivor of Utoya told the Norwegian station NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it goes a bit further after I have seen and heard the suspect."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and worked calmly and professionally during the entire hearing. He looked journalists and survivors in the eyes as he entered the building and left again.
Despite Breivik's bizarre indication that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had been complicit.
It may seem that the attacks of July 22 were the work of a single extremist and not of a group of radicals.
But does this automatically ease the grief and confusion that an entire nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," the victim said.
"It would be so much easier if he did it."
7 lessons of the interview with the late Steve Jobs, which this week was shown in a theater
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5th, some compared him to Henry Ford, highlighting the engineering genius as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple fans find perhaps the most revealing in the recently re-discovered job interview, which this week before special screenings in the important markets has been dusted, is how much this creative head has understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self-appointed hippie, but he was also an active organizer who worked diligently on diagrams - a man who believed that many executives suffer from "a disease of thinking" "that makes a really great idea 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Professional Idiots" about the outbreak of the Personal Computer. And he sat together for more than an hour with jobs in which they conducted one of the rare, detailed conversations.
At that time, 10 years had passed since jobs had been pushed out of Apple. And he already worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, and was looking forward to the wide adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview was used in specialist idiots, he says that the copy templates of the interview were missing in the delivery.
It was only after job death that a complete VHS copy was discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly revised film material forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which comes into the Landmark Theatre on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is aware that he abhors extensive interviews, jobs here appear surprisingly zealous in explaining his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
Over the course of the interview, there will be four longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of reflection in which jobs clearly weigh their thoughts and strive for accuracy.
There are also moments in which Job's perfectionism comes to light when he seems impatiently responds to Cringely's questions and pushes him to respond more quickly to topics or side actions of greater importance.
In front of the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone recorded, the lost interview seems somehow incredibly farsighted when jobs evaluate what other companies do in their opinion right or wrong and its own vision for the future of the computer.
It is one thing to read posthumous tributes to the career of jobs. But to see jobs here as the greedy dreamer who is on the jump to grandeur is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this, he got off and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the lost interview:
As he learned to run a company:
"During all the years in the business, I always ask, "Why do you do things?" and the answer you always get is, "Oh, that's just how it's done."
Nobody knows why he's doing what he's doing.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues its efforts to rationalize bookkeeping at Apple.
Surprisingly, how costs were recorded - usually one started with "standard costs", which were calculated on mere assumption and then adjusted with "difference" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that the business costs could be determined to the lowest.
As the Pope became aware:
Jobs tells of the "Blue Box", which he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which one could sneak into the telephone company and conduct long distance calls for nothing.
Much has already been written about the device, but jobs enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-power is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a fee-based phone, making a call and then connecting from an AT&T network to another, while they drag through as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things around the globe for half a dozen times, and when you cried on the phone, it came out a minute later on the phone next door," says Jobs looking.
"We were young and we learned that we can build something ourselves that can control trillions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We both, we didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that can control a gigantic thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think there would be Apple without it.
Jobs continues to tell of a glorious strike that Wozniak and he almost withdrew when they called in the middle of the night via the Blue Box in the Vatican and wanted to speak to the Pope, while they were able to imitate Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two had to laugh off before the Pope himself came to the phone.
How he fell in love with technology (and unprepared Bill Hewlett called):
At the age of 12, when looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, jobs for the summer received a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard.
"That had a remarkable impact on me. It was the only company I had seen at age and it shaped my views about what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever manufactured".
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with a brown tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve innovation:
Many times in the interview, jobs talk about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he built up some records, he was asked by a customer to assemble the entire computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think through both the assembly and the delivery of the finished equipment.
Later at Apple he recalls the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember pervasive arguments... They yelled at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later we had a mouse that we could build for $15. That was incredibly credible.
Over large companies that leave behind:
Long before he revived Apple, jobs foresaw the ways in which so many industrial giants rode with their visions in stumbling and lost control of their shares.
"Do we say you work at IBM or Xerox, so do you make a better copyper or printer, well and?"
They own the monopoly of shares, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [there are such people], which ultimately lead the companies and the product with which people are pushed out of the decision-making process.
The product genius, which has led to this monopoly position, is eradicated by people who do not have a concept regarding good products vs. bad products - craftsmanship is necessary.
This happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
One could have been ten times larger, could have been Microsoft in the 1990s...
You won the victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"There is a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, change it and grow."
You learn a lot about his subtleties.
You have to make votes, certain things you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5,000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
Finally, it runs out to the taste, it goes beyond trying to deal with the best stuff that humans have created and then trying to bring these things together to what they do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it were not the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas are dining with opponents of the health laws, as court accepts case
On the day when the Supreme Court assembles behind closed doors to discuss the politically divided question of whether or not to listen to the health laws of President Obama, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, participated in a dinner sponsored by the law firm that the case is represented in court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met for a meeting to discuss the petitions for examination.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a complaint that 26 states have filed against the far-reaching reform of the healthcare system, which was decided by Congress last year, a law that became a slogan for conservative activists throughout the United States.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, in March, a 5 1/2 hour fundamental discussion is expected, the outcome of which is likely to be the start of the 2012 presidential campaign, which will be in full swing at the time the court decision is announced.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and claim that the law is too clumsy will probably be Paul Clement, once the Attorney General under the government of George W. Bush.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that supported the Federalist Society's annual dinner, an old-fashioned group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the economic associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which contests the law.
Another sponsor was Pfizer Inc., who is financially involved in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had discussed the case in a Washington hotel.
Service had, among other things, Mitch McConnell, the head of the Republican faction in the Senate and a declared opponent of health reform
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: The two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for years.
And this does not violate moral rules.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct, which governs the actions of the lower Federal Judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under the principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge may participate in benefits events of law nearer and other organizations, where the judge may not be a speaker, guest of honor or, according to the program, not be a guest of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the related law firms as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in this to alert moral and government activists.
"This amazing breach of morality and the contrast to the Code punishes the actions of some judges lying, the court adheres to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and dinner at court during a Benefizi event with lawyers with floating proceedings."
Their appearance and support of a donation campaign for this event undermine any claim to impartiality and are unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say that they would mix courtship too easily with groups that are led by the agenda, such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagen was a state attorney general under the Obama administration when the first legal disputes were brought before the Court of First Instance.
Their critics urged Kagan to withdraw himself from the hearing of the case for preconception, as it was too much engaged in defending the law in order to be unprejudiced.
Browsing doesn't do this to institutions.
Boeing draws record order from 18 trillion dollars ashore
Airline Emirates ordered 50 dual aircraft of type Boeing 777 with an option on 20 other aircraft.
In addition, Boeing sells six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a business worth more than 1 trillion dollars.
It is really a rare news that a company gets an order over 50 pieces of its products.
But it is a big deal if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft totals is at a record sum of 18 trillion dollars.
The client of Boeing is equally unusual: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East will need 2.520 aircraft worth 450 trillion dollars in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced on the weekend its biggest contract for commercial aircraft of all time, measured by the value of the order: 50 dual Boeing 777 Jets.
The hammer order came from the airline Emirates from Dubai.
The airline also announced that it was in 2011 at the Dubai Aviation show that it had an option to purchase 20 more aircraft that would raise the entire list price to 26 trillion dollars.
On Monday, according to Boeing Oman Air, six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, ordered enormous improvements to the petrol consumption and comfort of passengers.
The list price for six of these aircraft is over $1 trillion.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, Chief of Exchange of Morningstar.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by oil producing countries.
So they don't just have the money to pay for the aircraft. Rather, an increase in oil prices, which usually harms the airlines, because this is one of their biggest cost points, is not as damaging as the country earns at a higher oil price.
This is important because less than other airlines tend to cancel or move aircraft orders when oil prices rise, Dihora said.
"You have natural security," he said.
The appointment of Emirates confirms Boeing's leadership position on the market for large-scale aircraft and helps keep the Airbus competitors SAS in check, which attacks the dominance with the A350.
Boeing's victory on the show comes four months after Airbus announced that it would postpone the introduction of the largest A350, which is competing directly with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was postponed in order to gain more confidence after customers had demanded higher payload and reach.
The Boeing shares rose by 1.5% to $67.94.
Sister of the Mexican President loses apparently election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug dealer Gegner Fausto Vallejo supported the PRI for the governors' posts in the race.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon apparently lost her application for the office of governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. She claimed on Monday that drug dealers had influenced the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo won the race for the governors of the Western state from the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI.
"The intervention of organised crime during the entire electoral process and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview one day after the Sunday elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our employees in the polls ... you have occupied election booths, built street blockades ... and ordered people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled for seven decades in Mexico until it lost its presidency in 2000.
But they are striving for a return and victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have hit Claderon just barely, which had led in the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate of her brother's conservative partido Acción Nacional PAN, refused to accept Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, the current governor, came to third place, a severe defeat for the split and happy left leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to accept the provisional results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies links with drug traffickers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the home country of President Calderon and he has chosen Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
Violence is still ongoing.
A PAN mayor was killed one week before the election during an election for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates have risen out of fear of the local elections.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how outrageous the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who is likely to represent the PRI in the race around the presidential office is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory makes us look brave next year."
ADB urges Asia to help save the Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the Eurozone in its severe debt crisis in order to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow down the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, director of the ADB based in Manila, said that the two world's fastest growing economic nations need to do "everything in your power" to speed up the recovery of the currency block either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned against the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) who are "passionless" looking at the difficulties in Europe and said that financial support for European leadership and resources through Asia will help prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in the same boat."
"Anyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is therefore helpful," he said the Financial Times in an interview on the margins of the Mumbai World Economic Forum.
"Asien may be protected to some degree, but it is not immune."
"If China and India can help, then by all means."
Europe's monetary union has been facing a serious debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's interest cost has increased dangerously, and the Prime Ministers both of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emerging severe debt crisis in Europe is fraught with fears that the global economy could fall into recession and led to calls that the leading emerging economies would have to join forces to support the euro area.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled by the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of EU peace fund bonds, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - offer greater negotiating power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, Indian Trade Minister, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the Eurozone, as its own economy is now suffering from the falling exports and the dried-up flow of foreign capital.
"No one wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We face major challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's an assignment, because where else we'll find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies like India have no authority to help rich Europeans if they face major economic challenges themselves.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University, said that it would be politically very difficult to sell the 1.2 trillion people in India help for Europe of which more than 800 million of 2 dollars or even less live on the day.
"Sometimes they will find out that the Greeks retire with 50 and spend vacations on the beach. Then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, also asked why India's reserves should be used to keep many and well-paid employees in the public service in Greece, with jobs in poorly managed, loss-making facilities such as the railways.
Mr. Nag said that the crises in the Eurozone will have "significant domino effects" throughout Asia.
The forecast of the ADB with an economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia for the years 2011/has now threatened "the risk of classification" due to the imminent danger from Europe.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets would have to create "crisis plans" in order to protect themselves from a downward trend and significant capital emigration of their sayings.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon about possible incisions in the defense system
Minister of Defense Leon Panetta called the Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would unnotice weaken national security, thus triggering a financial chain reaction from the halls of the Pentagon to the war scenes in Afghanistan and the civil ties.
The Pentagon is already considering cuts of 450 trillion dollars over the coming decade, but is now afraid that further cuts of 600 trillion dollars or more will be necessary if the Congress is unable to complete its spending.
"The effects of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry," wrote Panetta in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that failure of Congress in achieving a budget agreement, which will lead to so-called confiscation, would lead to 23% general cuts as well as a stop of numerous new projects.
"Such a high reduction, carried out in such an unminded way, would make most of our ship and construction projects impracticable - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously harm other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to dissociate ourselves involuntarily from a large part of our civilian staff and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to leave civilians with the certainty of borderline probability in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our alertness."
The cuts were finally hit by the combat troops," Panetta said.
"While the seizure did not directly affect the wartime quotas in the anti-terrorist campaign, the serious intervention in the basic budget would adversely affect the war effort," Panetta warned.
"Personal settings have been curtailed, which would lead to delays in the attitudes and attitudes that would support the war."
"The salaries of staff would be reduced, which would lead to late payments to wartime traders and would be disrupted by legal and political support."
The two senators answered Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential impact of automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of the seizure of the Department of Defense would lead to a rapid decline of the United States as a leading military force in the world."
"We are vehemently opposed to this draconian act," said the Senators in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is a result we can't live with, and there's certainly no one to push us up."
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and should not be allowed to occur."
Whether Panetta's letter and the new warnings of the senators will increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget or will reinforce demands to exclude the Pentagon from cuts remains to be expected.
Panetta has increasingly unblemished the possible cuts, although he could gather many years of experience with the budget in Congress and in the White House before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he is facing difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defence painted a dark picture of what could happen - a military with a shell, but without a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an air force squadron without sufficiently trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers capable of fulfilling the mission," Panetta said in his opening address at the Pentagon.
"It is a force of struggle that lacks morals and alertness and is unable to absorb it with potential opponents."
"She's actually making one get angry."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta introduced new details on how reductions "created significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious limitations on our global employability and maturity, leading to an unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects of cancellation could fall victim to the victims, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the fighter pilot F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground-fighting vehicle that the Army and Marine need to replace the Humvee.
If one stopped the further development and testing of the F35, this would save up to 80 trillion dollars in the next 10 years, but the supporters say that it is an important next step to upgrade so that possible dangers can be banished by China and other opponents.
How to Unearthe a Lie
A look at the current headlines shows how thoughtful and widespread deception and lies are in everyday life.
The Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain, is concerned with becoming the master of sexual harassment on the part of several women, both sides lying to each other.
Penn State's leadership is accused of perjury, as reports allegedly have been withheld, after which a retired football coach boy has sexually abused.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nikolas Sarkozy claimed to be a liar to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
The New York Congressman and internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner became a fool when he introduced denials that were very quickly refuted by inescapable evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards is charged with the violation of campaign financing, which is linked to the protection of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced the media circus triggered by President Bill Clinton when he lied in the Oval Office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term of office.
Stories about foaming in school and college exams are widespread.
There were incidents in which teachers gave their students the examination answers so that they themselves could be good at their performance reviews.
Mentores, who should teach the opposite, send a message that lies and foams are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
As studies prove, we lie between 10 and 200 times every day.
Many of these lies, however, are regarded as mere lies.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Identifying lies or "discovering lies" is one that is important for every person, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from a social game such as Sharaden, in which the goal is to call "Hab dich!", detaching a deception is a serious field of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at respected universities that carried out far-reaching research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most ancient myths have been deranged from the lie.
Lies look into your eyes.
They don't always stutter, stammer, rot, and dapple.
However, it must not be concluded that these liars are difficult to uncover and deter.
A trained liar can pervade the truth by learning something about the structure of the claim, the subtle facial expressions, about questioning and timing.
I have spent several years investigating the scientific results of the comprehensive and steadily growing area of deterrence. And it is clear that deterrence of a deception is a modern ability that is easy to learn and helps us in finding out where we are in our complex world, especially if the setting up or questioning of persons or negotiations or administration is one of our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at appreciating other people's interests, their interest and their own emotions, and they feel intuitive as they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research we know that the extroverted people often lie more than introverted people, that men often appear "self-oriented" lies than women whose lies are more "orientated to others" - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people lie to their partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are usually "fat lies").
We also know that if a person has been defrauded as an evildoer, others feel less guilty about having lied to that person.
How do you recognize if someone's lying?
First, by observing the normal behavior of this person.
This is called "baselining", the starting position.
It provides a reference point for later assessing changes.
Watch the attitude, the laughter, the voice quality of your subject.
You should know better when someone usually constantly triples with his foot so that they do not unjustly accuse him when he triples with his foot during a meeting.
Then pay attention to accumulations of prominent verbal and nonverbal behaviors.
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells that shrill, not as evidence of detonation.
People who deceive may stare when they try to remember their story. Maybe they show their feet towards the door or they lean towards the exit, change their position significantly or show a "suspension after the interview", these deep, relaxing exhales and the change in attitude when all hard questions are over.
Questioning often falsely signals that an interview is over, just to keep looking after this relaxation after the interview.
In addition, pay attention to the language of your subject.
Scott Peterson's scout is famous when he used the past form when he claimed that his murdered wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Deceptive people can also use a distanceing language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeat a tricky question overall.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer a tricky question: "Well... to tell you the truth ... to the best of my knowledge ... to the best of my knowledge and conscience."
This makes the answer more perceptive than factual, which often makes the alarm bells shrill.
There is no magic to defuse lies, but you can learn skills, thanks to which defrosting is possible.
Thanks to these skills, everyone can become less likely to be the victim of fraud, both in private and professional life.
Controversy of an oil pipeline plan is subject to delayed US approval after risk
A few days after the Obama government threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, which angered the trade unions and at the same time reassured environmentalists, the pipeline-building companies are trying to re-plan the project so that you can return to normality.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be diverted from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Parliament building.
Alex Pourbax from TransCanada said that the company is still confident that the pipeline will ultimately be approved, albeit with a different course.
This was followed by an announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week, after which a decision on federal approval for the project would be delayed until the new possible process was reviewed, which avoided the area of sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a large underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," said Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, opposite Fox News.
The new environmental review organised by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may take place by 2013, after the elections next year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama said last week in a written statement that the decision was a task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and agreed to his support.
The 1700-mile pipeline was connected to Canada with the Gulf of Mexico.
She would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
To do this, the Pipeline would have to cross six states.
They hate environmentalists, but they love labour markets, because they appreciate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But the legislators of Nebraska, who are against the plan, dared to force a departure from the region of the Sandhills and the Ogallala aquifer, a main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project had little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy economy states that the principal auditor of the Ministry has requested a separate probe of the review procedure focusing on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether an undertaking entrusted with carrying out the original study was an inappropriate choice as it is related to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle was accused because she allegedly forced a toddler out of fear of breaking
A New York family claims that the Disco-Diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of its Manhattan building had a terrorist attack that would have put her little daughter in such fear that she surrendered for fear.
The tirad of the "Lady Marmalade" singer, the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk, was so afraid that she suffered from "personal changes, sleep disorders" and "increased fear of strangers", said her family before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was November 10th last year when stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten girl, and Genevieve wanted to break up for a family trip.
While Kevin Monk got the car, Roseanna Monk went with the luggage and Genevieve on her arm to the lobby in her building at Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and dropped her daughter for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her back on her arm," she said.
LaBelle admonished the pregnant woman to be angry.
"She said in an aggressive tone, "You shouldn't put your daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She got angry and started to smear - she used the F word and the A word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and began to tap water from the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve had become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBelle rushed to the mother, who was still carrying Genevieve on her arm, and had to be held back from her companionship and moved to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The baby screamed so much that it had to surrender, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family asked in writing for an apology, but received no answer.
LaBelle's lawyer and representative did not respond to requests for an opinion.
The complaint is based on an undetermined compensation, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he was not charging fees and the family was planning the money they were getting, the child cancer aid will be donated.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior," said Davis.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is placed on the day of a nanny carrying an 18-month-old baby on her arm."
Climate change slowed down the economy
In the first year in which Mario López Valdez is in the government, in Sinaloa unemployment and undeclared work rose, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloas. It is the first year in which Mario López Valdez, who described himself as the initiator of the change and has built great hopes for economic growth, is in government. However, due to the climatic hardships, growth cannot be the talk, but on the contrary, the main economic indicators deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February caused not only losses in the millions of farms, but also close to the growth of the national economy, causing a general decline in economic activity by 3.6 percent in the first quarter, mainly due to the historical decline in agricultural development by 31.16 percent, which slowed down the impact on other sectors of the economy.
According to a report published by Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (the Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development) on the effects of the frost, 582,000 hectares of land used for agriculture were damaged, 78.03 percent of which were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent were partly destroyed.
The decline in economic activity by November has continuously increased in the Mexican state. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter of the year, since from January to March, 55,053 people had no employment, corresponding to 4.53 percent of the working population. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate rose to 5.28 percent and from July to September to 6.19 percent, resulting in 74 000 unemployed in Sinaloa. That is 18,969 people more than in the first quarter.
Low liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa in the year dates back to several factors. The economist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), commented, the policy of the public institutions indirectly explains the growing unemployment.
"What we are currently observing is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors. Among other things, with loss of liquidity in the market due to the cuts in the averages by legislation adopted to combat money laundering in Congress, because for those who are forbidden to raise dollars, it is not easy to let them work for themselves, invest them, or use anything else," he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that the growing unemployment rate is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the country looking for work abroad, especially in the United States, has fallen. This is due, on the one hand, to the entry problems and, on the other hand, because it is difficult to find work there too. These people stay here and look for work here to increase unemployment," he says.
Blacksmiths' wares
The analysis of the Sinaloa labour market is even more serious if the high proportion of undeclared work is taken into account, which, according to INEGI, includes 60.38% of the country's employees who work without paying into the social security funds.
Unemployment and undeclared work are the lowest wages in the whole of Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Insurance Institute) and the Secretariía del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Government Office for Labour and Social Welfare in Mexico).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos until September, which is much less than the general government average, which is 7375 pesos.
Reduction of the ADI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and growing unemployment, the largest decline in foreign direct investment (ADI) in the last ten years is recorded in 2011. According to Secretariía de Economía (State Economic Authority), the ADI from January to June amounted to 630 597 dollars, which corresponds to a drop of 87.74 percent compared to the 5 143 312 dollars in the same period of the previous year.
The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (government agency for economic development) has a total investment of 17,280 000 pesos in 2011, mainly from tertiary sector enterprises.
The debt
In view of the economic crisis, in July at the National Congress, the Government requested a loan of 3 000 000 000 000 pesos to be invested in the reactivation of the economy in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities.
Reactions
For the representatives of entrepreneurship, the first year of government made Mario López Valdé's inadequacy evident.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (State Chamber of Manufacturing in Mexico), stated that no efforts were made in 2011 to harmonise the views of the different sectors, including the state government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very poor this year. We need to work hard to regain the terrain lost this year and we need to make double efforts in 2012. The efforts of all and in particular the progress of the well-coordinated government team have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo López said that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year made the country's economic development difficult and slowed down.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the frost. One of the most important impacts is a slow economy, which is not sufficiently in motion to produce economic dynamics that could produce an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. That is why we will conclude the year far below our expectations," he said.
Redefine Profession
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, Chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Companies of Mexico) in Sinaloa, stated that the state should be moved to more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme to redefine the economic profession and line of the country, because it is important to activate all material and human resources, Sinaloas," he said.
There's a lot to do
The Chairman of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that will steer the government's efforts towards better governance.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He stressed that the current state power had made progress with the government.
"There are areas in which one can say that the government has acted more comprehensively. What I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Arrest for 8 kg marijuana
To five years in prison and 100 days in prison, a resident of Navolato was sentenced to eight kilos of marijuana.
The Republic Public Prosecutor's Office announced that the drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health - here the property of marijuana destined for trade.
According to Act AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by the Mexican military during the surveillance of Cipriano Valdez Street in the town of El Castillo, Navolato, in respect of security post 80.
The drug dealer carried a small backpack in a white van in which he found a black bag in a box in the car and on the passenger seat where the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the seized goods were handed over to the judge of the district and the culprit is still in the penitentiary.
Debt for construction works
The social buildings provided for in the Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed due to lack of resources or only with great delay, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The head of the urban social development authority stated that, although the construction programmes have already advanced, they are now in danger, as the government has not paid the funds it has allocated, which exceed 11 million peso for the three programmes.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes involved almost 50 million peso, of which 25 percent fell to the state. Until now, only the Federación and the municipality had contributed to the construction work, which is why a delay in the construction termination is to be expected.
"12 million they have to contribute, and although the year is already over, they have not given us any money, and that, although they had to pay us a bit in July," he said. "In order not to be too late, we have already begun the construction work, and they have already advanced far, but we need the money."
He pointed out that under the government of Jesus Aguilar Padilla the State had failed to fulfil its obligations, so at the beginning of its reign the municipality had to borrow 7 million. This corresponds to the amount that the central government had to pay.
"This had happened to us in the last legislative period, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programmes continued and this year we had to purchase the funds that the State had not provided to participate in these programmes," he explained.
Although the public authorities were obliged to pay these funds, he commented that the Minister for Administration and Finance had requested that administrative work be speeded up and that the remaining part be paid as soon as possible.
"They have to contribute almost 12 million, and although the year is already over, they have not given us any money."
The Court approved the transition to digital television in Mexico in 2015
Conversion of analogues to digital signals has been one of the most important changes in the world over the last few years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional lawsuits filed by the Senate and the House of Deputies against the presidential decree and called for the transfer of analogues to digital signals from 2021 to 2015 due to a lack of eight votes required to challenge the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his responsibilities when he issued the Decree-Law with details on the switchover to terrestrial digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute raised by the Senate, since it did not receive the required qualified majority of eight votes so that the court could decide on constitutionality or non-constitutionality. Thus, the law remains in force.
The project for the appeal, which was drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed to declare the Decree-Law for non-constitutional, since the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico) was responsible for the regulations concerning radio and television, which would contradict hierarchical principles and legal reservation.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed complaints against the Decree-Law. Following the adoption of the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the Decree-Law and applied all activities to set up the digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the appeal filed by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the debate on the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In its contribution, the Prime Minister stated that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the country government should not regulate the measures to be taken by the public administration by means of general rules.
"I also do not believe that if this were to be done, the independence of the regulatory body would be compromised." She also reminded us that the central government is responsible for the planning of strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons, because they are responsible for state affairs.
The replacement of analogue signals by digital is one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years around the world, and it results in a better use of the radio-electric spectrum, an increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The postponement of the changeover, she said, was a postponement of the exploitation of digitalisation, which is a decision in the public interest which not only has a technical point of view, "because it covers economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, she stressed, "required the action of the whole system, in accordance with the principle of economic governance by the state, they included a group of features which put the Constitution in the hands of the central government."
It called to mind that many countries around the world had already carried out the digital transformation, even though they had highly specialised institutions.
It cannot be concluded that the government intervened with the publication of the contested decree in the powers of Congress, because the laws adopted by the legislature would be complied with," she assured.
The possibility of counting the ballots individually in Michoacán is considered.
According to PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the election of the governor is close to 27 percent, with 879 votes in total of 6074 not yet counted.
The possibility of the individual counting of the ballots is a reality this year in the Michoacán elections, because according to the data published by the Programa deResultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between the first and second place in the governorial elections is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Elekctoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, pointed out that only last November, the electoral office had adopted a number of rules to harmonise local rules with the reforms of the states in electoral matters.
It should be recalled that Michoacán had neither adapted his political constitution nor his electoral law nor his law on electoral justice to the reforms adopted by the Congress, so that they had not entered into force at this round of elections. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the public prosecutor within the time limits provided for by the argument or objections.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional appeal filed by the local legislature and judged the representative's vote on the constitutional reforms as "invalid and illegal" since it did not have the right to "adoption or veto".
María de los Ángeles Llanderal explained in an interview about the possibility of the individual counting of votes that, thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by the Consejo General del IEM, the possibility now exists that the local electoral authority could either partially or completely list the ballots.
Thus, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more ballot packages may be partially counted The results of the protocols do not match; the Minutes on the counting and calculation of votes are not factually available or are not owned by the Chairman of the Election Committee or there are obvious errors or amendments in the protocols.
In addition, if there is a difference between the likely winner and the one standing in second place, which is equal to or less than one percent, the total number of full ballots may be counted, provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an explicit request from the party or coalition chairman, who is the second of the named candidates.
Votes may also be counted in their entirety if, after completion of the orderly calculation, it is established that the difference between the likely winner and the candidate in the second place is equal to or less than one percent, provided that there is an explicit request from a representative of the party whose candidate has become second. In this case, the electoral packages exposed to partial counting would be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation where, according to PREP, the difference between the first and the second place is about 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 out of 923 election protocols have not yet been counted.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered across the Zapalinamé Mountains, confirming the family.
The rest of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés blew down this Sunday evening at Saltillo, his birthplace. On Monday the show of the dead and a Mass of the Dead took place.
According to family members, the last will of the colonel was that his ashes would spread over the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After an honor, the Bacio Cortés family, together with the others, returned to the capital of Coahuila on a plane of the Mexican Air Force in the event of the accident. The Supreme One took part in the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon, the upper lieutenant's ashes landed at the wedding hall at Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, where the family members and friends came.
At 5.30 p.m., his remains were examined at the Technology Institute of Saltillo. This body show was commissioned by his former students from technical abitur and his American football team, to which Felipe Bacio was a member during his preparation for the Abitur.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ashes would spread out over the Zapalinamé Mountains. He had always said that to his family and his friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, pilot's sister.
From her point of view, the lieutenant-in-chief had fulfilled all his dreams and she believes that he stood in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, exceptionally as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young to enter the Zapopán Air Force School, Jalisco.
Some could not grasp it because they thought it would even make him dwindle on a truck. Nevertheless, he always sought to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembered him as a good person. "He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and already the whole family wanted to welcome him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that he was even at the age of seven after Zapopán to graduate his family. Therefore, he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: flying an airplane.
A final farewell
The senior lieutenant of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was approved with all honour under the direction of Governor Jorge Torres López. Her honor gave him the people and the government, the Mexican army of the sixth military area, the Mexican Air Force, the head of the school and the students of Saltillo's technological education institute, where he studied in 1985 and received an outstanding education as well as sports.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago, when the helicopter he had flown, in which the Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other persons from the same authority were killed.
At 6:05 p.m., the nested remains of Bacio Cortés, the citizens of Saltillo, met to be handed over to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, in front of the barracks. His family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers, were already waiting for him.
The abandoned body was found on a plot at Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the find, military personnel introduced eleven people who had been arrested in the same village in connection with organized crime.
Three men were found killed by shots in various body parts and a grace shot in a deserted finca in the town of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event had taken place at mile point 1.5 of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several transitors saw that the door of the country house surrounded by a beige-brown wall was piled wide.
As they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three persons about three meters further inside, which they immediately told the competent authorities.
One wore a yellow T-shirt and dark pants, without shoes; next to him was another one that was dressed with a white top.
Almost a meter away was the body of another person with a red T-shirt and blue pants.
All three were lying on their stomachs.
According to the information received on site, the three persons must have been murdered in another place, as no shells have been found.
On the wall of the country house you can read inscriptions that write one organized gang of criminals to another, as well as several shots were found in the wall and door.
11 persons arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional (State Secretariat for National Defense) presented 11 persons, including a minor who were part of a crime which was mainly in the town of Cadereyta and who are associated with kidnappings, murder, halconeo (human hunt) and secret funerals.
According to the information published, eight persons were arrested in Los Alveros on 11 November and a prisoner was released.
Three real estate and one cell phone were secured. The prisoners confirmed to be members of the criminal group "Los Zetas".
On November 12 at 6:00 a.m., the military found a car with no number plates with two passengers on their guard round the town of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta.
During the inspection of the car, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, on November 13 at 2 p.m., one of their accomplices was arrested in the municipality of La Frauda, who tried to take refuge at the sight of the military.
They are charged with secret settlements in the towns of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
Education of the new Italian Government on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce this new government, which will provide the headlong crisis that Italy has led to the economic collapse.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce this new government, which will provide the headlong crisis that Italy has led to the economic collapse.
A statement from the Presidency's Palace announced that the Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with the President, Giorgio Napolitano, on Wednesday to confirm government formation.
It is expected that he will present a majority of technocratic cabinets, although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister will take office.
Monti said he would present the President with the results of the talks with the political parties on government formation.
"I want to reaffirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to cope with these difficult times," said the former EU Commissioner to the journalists.
Monti did not explicitly confirm government formation, but his comments show that the obstacles were overcome.
The "frame is now well positioned", he added.
Monti has managed in less than three days to form a government, which is much less time than normal. Meanwhile, Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has led to an unbearable level of debt costs.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, must adopt a strong austerity package called for by the euro politicians to regain confidence in Italy.
The pressure to rush on Monti was further exacerbated by the fluctuating market situation, as a result of which Italian government bonds were charged with 7 percent interest for 10 years, which corresponds to the situation in which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European rescue shield.
Emma Marcelaglia, President of the Italian Industrial Association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government in all our efforts."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
The chances of success were greatly increased by the support of the party PDL of Silvio Berlusconi, who had to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are intended to produce good results," said Angelino Alfano, Secretary of the Middle Right Party.
The support of the PDL, Italy's largest party, is essential, for so far many of its members have spoken out against a majority of technocratic governments, which are just Monti.
Parliament's support
The new Monti government needs strong parliamentary support to implement the probably unpopular austerity measures.
Resistance to its efforts or delaying the reforms could once again cause a devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Federation of Foreign Banks also exerts pressure with its indication that a failure of Monti was a disaster.
Monti started on Monday with his debates with political parties, trade unions and business associations, as well as with youth and women's organizations.
The meeting is due to be concluded on Tuesday evening.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who has initiated an extremely rapid change of government in response to the crisis.
After a short breath towards the end of last week, when it was announced that Berlusconi would resign, due to the uncertainty over the success of the new Prime Minister, the costs of Italian government bonds have again reached critical limits.
A rescue of Italy with a public debt of EUR 1.8 billion would be too much for the current EU rescue shield.
Monti said that his government had to take up to the next elections expected in 2013, despite the predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms, instead of preferring the elections.
Monti said that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this should consist only of technicians, a reference to their concerns in the light of the procedure imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources point out that mutual distrust and disagreements between the parties complicate the involvement of people from political life.
Spaniards have more game opportunities than the Ticos
Of the 22 players called from Spain, ten have over 50 international games on the bat.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 called 50 games is behind them.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when the 22 players from both countries are compared to each other for the friendship game that takes place today at 15.05 in the National Stadium of San José.
While the world and European champions, the number one on FIFA's monthly ranking, can look back on a significant number of class A selection games, the three-colored team has only Michael Umana as the only player with over 50 international games.
He scored this number on the last Friday with the match against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players playing in the League de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England have every year the opportunity to participate in numerous home matches (lega and cup championships) as well as high-ranking European cups such as the Champions League.
In addition to this, the experience with the Spanish Furie will be gained with complicated secession games at the Eurocup and the World Football Championships.
The Tico footballers, on the other hand, have few international meetings within the context of the Concacaf, which is on the FIFA rankings at the very bottom.
We will see how the Spanish team draws their last record: The Torwart Iker Casillas, who on the last Saturday against England (down 0-1 in London) reached a match with the former gatekeeper Andoni Zubizarreta with 126 foreign games.
Casillas will play against the three-color team today and Spain a new record of 127 foreign games.
Xavi Hernández, player of Barcelona Football Club, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized last week by the UEFA, along with others of the Iberian team who had reached the magical number of 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the middle tower of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The number of hundreds is also approaching Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He follows Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the sides of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana are the left side tower of Junior Díaz with 48 games and the storm Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there, there were only five to over 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The ones with the least games.
Less than 30 games are held in the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
Out of the national team, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not even approaching the 20th border.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, recorded in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar only one and Ólman Vargas and Eddie Nelson did not have their debut yet.
Spain's historic gatekeeper is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz has shot nine most gates, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet moved Costa Rica into its tour to celebrate its 20th anniversary
"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that comes true"
In the exclusive conversation with Viva bassist Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They were expected for more than 20 years, but the band assures that when they play in Costa Rica, a dream will be realized for them.
This was assured by the bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva from Brazil last week from an exclusive interview.
The band is located in the South American part of its tour for the celebration of its twenty-year-old existence and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day, they perform in the National Stadium with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica from 19.30.
You can read an excerpt from the conversation, the full copy of which can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream is realized when Pearl Jam is playing in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what that means to your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that also comes true for us.
This is just the second time that we are playing in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I was only once on a holiday in Costa Rica. It is such a beautiful country that we will certainly stay there for a few days.
It is exciting for us to bring our music there.
I'm asking you this because the fans of the band are totally devoted, and they are experiencing the days before the concert most intensely.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thanks for standing by our side all these years.
We spent almost 21 years until we came to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we're sorry to have needed until we got here.
Some people even believe that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Don't you think that's gonna put a little pressure on your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we've been doing in the last 21 years have been held in the last two weeks.
We played on a couple of giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we want to play there.
We love this country, we like surfing and are enthusiastic about the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always gone surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico are the excellent areas for surfing. This way, about people who love surfing, we have learned about it.
With a look at the tour, you have offered huge shows with many songs.
What are your plans for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there, we don't set limits either.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think that's part of it because we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs. Everyone likes another song, so the decision we're going to play each other doesn't fall easy.
If we take two or three songs that we have not played anymore into the repertoire, we can maintain our concentration better and surprise us because they call us the reasons why we liked these songs. Otherwise, they could fall into oblivion.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think, therefore also for the audience.
With this tour you celebrate your twenty-year history.
When you look back, do you find it hard to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I don't think anyone imagined playing in a great rock band once, and that also for over 20 years, seems like a dream.
We also continue to focus on these blessings and find it great to be able to make music even now together.
We like and are enthusiastic about producing music.
We are lucky to be able to go to the places in the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean for you to have actively participated in the dawn’s birthtime?
It has always been an honor to belong to this group of big bands.
We are well friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and quite unusual when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Occasionally a band emerges from a city, but it is already unusual when five or ten groups come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud of it and feel honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. We are happy to be still friends with them all and we are honored to be part of this accumulated Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours has stayed together with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) met with us 13 years ago. This alone is a lot more time than many bands last.
First of all, I believe that we all appreciate being happy, still alive, and we also take care of each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical paths have opened up that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music. We couldn't be better.
Your relationship to fame has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success, you could always do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we grew has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be too often on tour, because it is too easy to drop this game with huge masses of people who love your music.
As long as you think that people have come because of the music, remember that you have to pay attention to the music and what it has created, without being preoccupied with being a famous rock star. That has never interested us.
What are your memories of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was great.
For three years we were a band that had never released a record until Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
We were disappointed to have needed so long. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who built the band with us, friends. When I listen to a song or see photos, I remember what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas is responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why the band selected for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and this band liked us best. That’s why we are curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. That will certainly be exciting.
Why do you always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings him, and I think he sings the first thing he likes.
Who were you influenced by as a bassist?
Of so many+
The first to come to me are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many people that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge alive, even though it is no longer a fashion appearance?
I don't think we all feel very connected to the word grunge.
When I think about it, the bands that I mentioned before, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and everyone else that came up at the same time, are coming up. If they’re still important today, I think it’s great, because it’s worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney do better music than ever before.
At first her music was darker, now she's more positive.
Why?
That’s interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that might seem a bit lenient. But there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe, which are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive about themselves.
Both of them came to me with tears when I heard Ed playing them, and they're very dark songs.
I think if you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life - for example, if you lose a family member or a friend - this affects your artistic work and your music and these two songs clearly affect me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to the hospital for medical examination
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, informed his family doctor.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is 25 years of imprisonment for human rights violations during his reign (1990-2000), has several diseases, including tongue cancer, which is operated and controlled four times.
Alejandro Aguinaga, a congressman and his personal doctor, told the television that Fujimori would be investigating for three days at the Peruvian hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas to determine the cause of his pain and muscle loss in the lower body members.
Aguinaga commented that, in his opinion, Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons, but he did not want to do so because he felt he was innocent.
He was operated on tongue cancer four times and he has lost 18 kilos of weight. In addition, other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and blood circulation problems in the legs were listed by the doctor.
Fujimori has been in Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Espeziales de la policía since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the death squad of the Peruvian army, who was secretly operating during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official delegation, led by the Uruguayan President José Mujica and composed of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will start their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to discuss trade between two countries and political issues in the region.
Mujica meets his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderón next Wednesday. According to information from the Uruguayan President, this will be the culmination of his booked schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective Uruguayan resident in Mexico.
The meeting of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries," announced the president's office of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is looking for Calderón's support in the incident with France when French head of government Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries which are still acting as tax havens, which were rejected by Uruguay and prompted a request to his ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has since November held the Presidency of the G20, a group of the world’s most powerful emerging and industrial countries. Since January this year there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid double taxation with the South American country.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to speed up the process of tightening up agreements for the exchange of tax information in order to be deleted from the "grey list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), with countries which have not introduced all international standards for tax cooperation.
At the business level, there has been a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay since 2004, which has contributed to a growing trade in goods between the two countries.
With "Super Mario 3D Land", the novice installer enters the third dimension
Super Mario has been tirelessly fighting for the rescue of the Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser for 25 years, but so far never in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game, which comes to the shoptops of all the world this month, was cut to the properties of the portable Ninten 3DS console, which can be played without a special glasses three-dimensional.
"Mario is the figure who has to say how the stereoscopy works without glasses," Omar Álvarez, the director of Nintendo's specialized press in Spain, assured him of the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez explained that "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first video game by Nintendo developed for this console from the beginning" because until now, success articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman stressed that, although it is three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "expensive" video game that allows a fast, liquid game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: The first part is "easy" to capture the less skilled users.
After that, the experts can "turn a second round" over the various levels of the game, which are becoming increasingly difficult.
In addition, users can choose between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, to overcome the obstacles, without becoming victims of the "optical effects", they must always be played three-dimensional.
This tour of Super Marios into the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has been no longer the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo twists the fans of the saga and repeats the recipe for success of the last editions: The tricky installer must overcome risky cracked platforms in order to free the Peach Princess.
However, the player encounters news in the motions, the environment, disguises and enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom is responsible for the delivery of Portillos to the United States
The President of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would take delivery of the former Governor Alfonso Portillo, so that he would be responsible in the United States for the US $70 million conspiracy.
Thus, the trial of the US's request for Portillo's extradition ends so that it can be brought before the court there.
At a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and the government, taking into account that a ruling court had already ordered the extradition.
He stressed that during his government he had not intervened in court decisions and had accepted all extradition applications he had been notified of.
Besides Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is delivered for murder and serious bodily injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both due to drug trafficking.
Coloms is a government act that takes place when all judicial and constitutional bodies are exhausted to condemn the former President of the State (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Guatemalan Constitutional Court, Portillo must be handed over once its legal situation is clarified in Guatemale and its human rights guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defense during his reign. This trial was preceded by extradition, but the minister objected and reinvigorated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people threatened by social exclusion
The organization was set up to prevent the marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of the Trinijove Social Assistance Organization have led to important results: In this quarter of the century, 6,000 young people were supported by social exclusion to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, more than a hundred jobs are created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary, an event was held yesterday in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, which took part in over 300 people.
Trinijove was founded in 1986 in the Trinitat Vella district with the aim of helping young people with low levels of education, without work, with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginality.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu took part in numerous responsible bodies and institutions that worked with the association during these 25 years.
The participation of political representatives of different directions at election times proved the impartiality of the work done by Trinijove.
Apart from the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol took part in the celebrations of former socialist education minister Ernest Maragall and former mayor and current left-green city council Ricard Goma.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats also visited the current Catalan Minister for Social Affairs and Family Affairs, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the director general of the social work of the Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was created in very difficult times and that today's times are no less complicated. But he added that the work done so far is "a good foundation".
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is a model that knows how to fight difficult circumstances and gives hope to people in difficulty.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work it does," he said.
Occupied house, where giant parties were held, was cleared
The house owners occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on the street Balmes No. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve houseowners left the building yesterday afternoon without resistance to have done it.
Everything indicates that the nightmares of the neighbors of the house No. 51 on Balmes street have ended.
Yesterday at noon, 12 people voluntarily left the building that they had illegally occupied and organized huge festivals that had driven the neighborhood to despair. The enclosure was made on judicial order without police intervention.
After the enclosure, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be controlled," confirmed the manager.
The houseowners, who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took along the entire electrical system and part of the water supply. They had also painted the walls and left all kinds of garbage, especially cans with alcoholic beverages.
In the three lower floors huge parties that lasted up to two days and drove the tenants to despair were celebrated.
In addition to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also damaged it.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europe Press that her business had decreased by 80% since the beginning of the household occupation.
The owners of the discotheque pointed out that the houseowners made their unfair competition, because they sold the drinks to three euros, while they cost 10 euros in the discotheque.
In addition, the owner of the leisure room had been shown by the neighbors due to disturbance of rest, while according to their statement the noise was not caused by the visitors of the disco, but by the houseowners and in particular by the guests of the feasts that were organized there, and who, according to the statements of the angry neighbours, became more and more and longer in recent weeks.
The person responsible for the discotheque explained that the harassment had been so great that it came together with the owner of the building that she would not have to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (urban police) also confirmed that they had received more complaints from their neighbors in recent weeks.
The president of the PP (Partido Popular People's Party) at the Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had last week demanded that the building be cleared immediately and that the problems of civil cohabitation and the disintegration of the district should be tackled.
He explained that before the summer, only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that the occupants of the house had invaded all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments in the last few months. In some, even thefts had come.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to take action against the a social acts in the building."
Yesterday another building was cleared by the Catalan police in the Nou Barris district.
At 3:30 p.m., the police approached Montral Street No. 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people wanting to enter the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
The architects, apart from the dispute over the fees, agree to the tender.
The city invitation to tender for the 16 gates reopens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now disappearing Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its confession on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
He was even compared in numbers to the Central Park of New York.
With the fall of the CMB in 1987, the park was again in the eyes of many people to the upper limit of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that do not spread in the north-south direction, but up (mountain) and down (sea).
The classification Collserolas as a nature park plays with this idea.
Now, as an example, Yellowstone with wild boars in the role of the yogi bear was no longer the central park.
So far, when the city was issued in September a huge invitation to tender, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access shops to Collserola.
Undoubtedly, a gate points to the concept of a park.
Either that's the case, or someone's going to put gates on the land.
The question arises of itself: Collserola, Park or Mountain?
The invitation to tender is not only from an organizational point of view, but also in view of a reflection on the city, the topic of conversation in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a recruitment theme to which two members of this old caste who meet in the elevator can draw.
And this very fact provides the fabric for one of the rare similarities between what three architects from Barcelona think about, and some university professors who have applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldán "it is necessary", after the attack on the coast to talk about the "Front on the Mountains" as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, which has not been carried out about the green apples.
"You should assume that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because he's well-accessible.
Collserola is more complex", the architect judges, for which the title "Tore of Collserola" contains a "Lexical trap": it is not "to be imagined as access to a park, but as a limit to areas in which action must be taken."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, sees the proposal as a "intellectual challenge", which involves "some dangers".
Risks arising from the "uncertainty of the design of a public space nowadays" based on the experiences of the 1980s which had their "swan song" in the forum.
The first fear is one's own limitation on what can be built.
"To confine something always means to set the next step", i.e. to exceed it.
"You have to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current [relative to the General Metropolitano (PGM)] plan can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who sticks closer to the question, says simplified, the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that does not move towards Barcelona", for purely topographical reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronat de Collserola, which should not "receive deaf ears", although he is grateful to the city administration that she has given its panel the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment".
In addition, he notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the guide letter, which allows the architects to participate in the debate, although he states his "differences" as to whether this technical profile is the multi-disciplinary team created in life ("the right one," he says) should lead "We architects should only be a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the headline of this article is complex, as the tendering terms lack a global view of Collserola: "16 competitions were posted in the cross-sectional section," he says, "on the axis of the mountain sea. But there is no longitudinal perspective that looks at the area in its entirety."
This has led at least in his case to his participation in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate.
In his opinion, the city should absolutely guarantee that the strip is equipped directly above the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length, resulting in a soft transition between city and green areas.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal who comes free
After 72 days of silence, Casino Red’s agent freed the Monterrey mayor’s brother from the trial, which is conducted against him for suspected extortion.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after the Casino Red official has allowed him to trial against the mayor of Monterrey for extortion before the Second District Criminal Court.
After the attack on Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás is likely to force him to pay a sum of money in order to allow the city administration to approve the secret operation of the Wetthaus.
After the prosecution, the prosecution opened a criminal procedure against the Panist mayor's brother, who was arrested for 30 days on September 2.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo capital.
In this place he remained 49 days after a second arrest warrant after the official of the Ministerio Público had rejected the crimes for bribery and organized crime.
On October 19th, he was transferred to Cadereyta Detention Centre because he probably bribed Casino Red's owners with one and a half million pesos. On the other hand, he stayed only a few hours in the Central Security District, as there were threats of murder against him.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the court proceedings as a citizen of San Nicolás de los Garza City Prison.
On 25 October, the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, sent him a arrest order, stating that after the almost two-month investigations, there was sufficient evidence to justify the payment of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the bethouse in order to open it in return.
On this Monday, the Casino Red official, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, asked the judge José Luis Pecina to release the mayor's brother the punishment, which is why he is set free in the next few hours.
During the judicial hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Minister of Público, García Gómez, asked if he had repaired the damage and which the owner of the bet house had pronounced his forgiveness. However, the lawyer withheld the name.
According to Case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is free to speak. Also, no appeals against the trial can be filed and no damages are requested.
After hearing the authorised representative of the Betthaus at 3.50 p.m., Larrazabal Bretón was immediately set free.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, went to San Nicolás de los Garza City Prison to inform Jonás that he had been acquitted and that his case would be filed.
He also informed him of the judicial arrangement for immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the aircraft accident in which Francisco Blake and seven other people were killed.
The Secretary of Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communication and Transport in Mexico) informed that the results of the investigation into the accident in which Francisco Blake Mora and seven other persons died indicate that the helicopter was attacked directly against the ground with its entire intact structure, without the pilot being able to launch an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, said that the pilot had confirmed that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight before the launch.
"The fact that the propeller wings were in contact with trees at 25 metres in height, while the helicopter lost the hull seems to indicate that the helicopter had had several ground contacts."
He also stated that the helicopter was built for 19 passengers, which is why it met all the requirements for the transportation of the staff.
In addition, he said that no helicopter parts were found during the investigations in the area where the machine had come down.
"When searching, no aircraft parts were found elsewhere, which covered the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 passengers, which is why it fulfilled all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has a slope of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present, it is a priority to get the results of the investigation as soon as possible, but they could take several months, perhaps even a year.
On the other hand, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for Aircraft and Relief Services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter of the Estado Mayor President flew on the hit at flight speed and the plane fell on a soft slope.
"This information reinforces the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of the impact."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, mentioned six relevant points that should be taken into account during the investigation:
Visibility flight:
In accordance with the flight standards, this was a flight according to the rules of the visual flight. This means that the team must have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions at the start. During the flight towards the border area between Mexico City and the Mexico State, some deep-hanging clouds rose.
Selected routes:
It is possible that due to the clouds the team had chosen a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Pop up location:
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter are consistent. There may not have been any loss of control of the aeroplane or a deviation from the flight path before impact.
Dissemination of aeroplane remains in a limited area:
The information available up to this time indicates that the helicopter had been impacted from a straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of scattered aircraft remains suggests that the helicopter was impacted on the ground with its pristine structure.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The aircraft's remains offer at the site of the accident let neither on fire nor on explosion close.
The final results indicate multiple ground contact.
During the on-site investigations, aircraft parts were found at an altitude of 9200 ft above sea level. The site is defrosted and shows a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter is likely to have broken.
Some information indicates that the helicopter may have had several ground contacts.
After a minute search on an area that went beyond the enclosed area at the site of the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft could be found, which reinforces the assumption that the undamaged aircraft structure was bumped against the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol to detect the gene for obesity
The National Social Insurance Institute of Mexico is head of a research project to find the gene for obesity in children and adolescents, which is supported by IPN specialists.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Mexico Social Insurance Institute) announced that it is a research project on the discovery of the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of Obesity in Childhood and Youth" with which genetic markers are to be found in conjunction with obesity.
Miguel Cruz López, Head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department of Medical Research, Focus Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI stated that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was established.
This team is supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate course at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and at the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested people can come to the sports places of the IMSS in the valley of Mexico, where tests with children and young people are conducted every Saturday from 8.00 p.m.
He stressed that the study started at the Cuauhtémoc sports field (in the west of the state of México) and was continued on the Nezahualcóyolt sports field (in the east of the state of México).
If the goal has been reached by 500 to 600 investigators, the study will be continued on the Independencia sports ground (in the south of the capital district) and completed on the one of Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He stated that the aim of the study was to identify the factors and role of genetics in relation to the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors for Mexican children and adolescents to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the global day of diabetes, he stated that it was intended that three thousand children and young people aged six to 14 should be filled in with the consent and under the supervision of their parents’ nutrition questionnaires.
They will also ask questions about their physical activity and their family history in order to control risk factors that may lead to diabetes or kidney failure.
It further stated that on those Saturdays the investigators were measured (weight, size, waist count), their blood pressure controlled and blood levels such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (test for identification of genes related to childhood obesity).
Cruz López stressed that this study would be carried out on the occasion of health care professionals' concerns about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"Health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in just under six years the percentage of obese boys increased by 77 percent and that the girls with obesity increased by 47 percent. The excess weight also increased dramatically," said the specialist of the IMSS.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the population of Mexico differed from that of other peoples.
He stated that a Mexican (in) averaged 65 percent of Indian-American, 30% of European and 5% of African descent, reflecting the genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
In general, he explained that the genetics of obesity were preoccupied with the inability to burn out the excess of energy (calorie) taken from us, so that it was stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to the investigators was derived from a comprehensive study of the children in which they would determine whether they had a degree of obesity or obesity.
It would even investigate the presence of dark skin folds in the neck and the inner arm (acanthosis), which indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes in the advanced stage.
All the information would be treated confidentially and communicated in writing to the parents by the doctors. The doctors explain all the measurement results to the parents and suggest to them changes in the lifestyle that are appropriate for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz López explained that there were three basic factors that are responsible for obesity, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of movement, i.e. lack of movement in everyday life, spending most of the day before the TV and using means of transport instead of walking short paths.
The high calorie intake, i.e. increased consumption of sugared drinks and carbohydrates (Tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) together with a high fat and protein intake as well as the genetics to be analyzed in this research project.
Asphalt by UNAM prevents potholes
Rafael Herrera, researchers at the Faculty of Chemistry at the Mexican University of UNAM developed modified asphalt with polymers to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If the signs that go out of the road surface were to be considered, it would not be necessary to repair almost 200 000 keyholes when the rainy season breaks out in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (city of the valley of Mexico), Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at the UNAM, warned and assured that if the construction and maintenance of the asphalt coating were to be adequately damaged, the number of impact holes would be significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his lecture "Technological loopholes", which he gave to chemistry on the occasion of the International Year, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible developed modified asphalt with polymers to produce a mixture similar to asphalt, but which has greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Mr. Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, in order to improve the behaviour of the pavement and thus avoid the occurrence of impact holes.
He explained that the asphalt – the heaviest part of the oil – is a hydrocarbon compound, some of which has a high molecular weight – the so-called asphalt – and the other part a low one – the so-called Malthene. Together, they give the street surface its characteristic tamelastic behaviour.
Zähelastic behaviour of the asphalt means that it behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of almost 180°C, at 120°C it is very viscous and almost solid at 50°C, while it becomes brittle at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes in one day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," explained the chemical engineer.
The researcher of the FQ noted that the streets of Mexico City had a majority of flexible pavements composed of six layers of material, the last three of which included asphalt.
Between the top layers lies a wear layer of asphalt, which consists of small asphalted and then fortified stones.
Each stone of this wear layer was bathed in asphalt.
When the vehicles continue to move and forces are generated on it, this layer enables a good distribution of power in the road surface.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would spread even better," said the chemical engineer.
"Over the wear layer," he explained, "a final layer will be laid out, the so-called bearing layer consisting of tiny stones, i.e., sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with the vehicle tyres, they need a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and it needs to produce friction.
The most powerful and distributed of this pavement also requires an adequate thickness and the material from which it is made must be maintained.
The weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature variations, are other important factors to consider, above all the water," he said, "because it significantly affects the behaviour of the wear layer.
When the terrain is wetted, water enters the layer and escapes only difficult again. This causes a softening of all strata of the road surface and, as a result, the occurrence of impact holes.
When a punch hole occurs," he said, "the cover will first be worn off, while the wear layer will only be affected after that. But the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that would have to be maintained in the first signs by adequate maintenance programs."
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) stated that the vehicle load was another important cause of the occurrence of impact holes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road surface always had to be proportionate to the vehicle load and it had to be ensured that this regulation was complied with in order to avoid frequent leakages.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there were still many research work to be done, such as on asphalt emulsions that were already on the market in other countries, with which the potholes could be repaired easily and without using high temperatures.
What did the candidate del Valle miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that led to Melina Ramírez Serna not getting the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle's getting his 14th disqualification.
Once again Valle del Cauca left empty when awarding the crown for Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content to stand on the podium of the winner, a silver crown and the band that they present as the new Miss Colombia.
This night's result in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took on the crown and the cedar, the department has already received 14 mistitles and Melina has joined the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who had almost held the crown in their hands. Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aleure (2008).
The big question that many are asking today is: What was missing?
Because the result is the decline of a great favorite woman who had shown at every demonstration that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. She was not for nothing elected Queen of Police and the Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titled who had also received the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and who took the crown of Miss Colombia home.
The first factor that counts as decisive for the jury's decision to appoint her as the first miss, is that she had not convinced her by Martín Murillo Gómez, the Carreta Literaria Leamos, of the answer to the question "What book has most influenced you and why?".
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
"I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it's a way to civilize, ultimately I think that the book, which was the strongest for my childhood, 'The Little Prince' is a rather profound book.
I am currently reading `Homage and blessing'. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I am reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called 'Leidencies'.
One answer, which was in little contradiction, first because of the term 'civilize' and second because it had not specifically explained in what way each of its named books had influenced it.
But after the ceremony ended, Melina declared to feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what must happen.
And for all people: Please read a little `The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that El Valle's favorite is burned out.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that she was the preferred one, who had all the incidentals and had received all the prizes in advance (Gastronomy Competition Easter, public vote on the best handmade costume and Reina Madre), "had made the other candidates jealous of what the Queen stressed, which could not therefore shine on stage."
And this was noticed at her first performance in the bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and at her two elevators at the coronation celebration.
Although she certainly appeared with both, she lacked the strength and momentum of Magdalena and Atlántico's representatives.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como en casa" at the RCN said that the fact that Melina was crowned a miss "shows that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the competition will not become Queen".
Furthermore, Valle left the press's end - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle was unable to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the national beauty competition.
It will already have its reason that two days before the international jury's composition Lucy Doughty declared that they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You have to look beyond the physical and focus on the social feeling, so that she had worked on projects before participating in the competition," she said.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of the Derriere and the fibrosis, which was noted in the stomach area. But this is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good eating habits and responsible physical work.
The queen's coach, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there would be better, "but her problem with the fibrosis on my stomach, which was frankly hardly noticeable to me, expressed her score on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes that the fault of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the surgical procedure she had undergone.
"The operations are okay, but Valle didn't know how to make them right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place had to pay her."
Because of this prize, which will be awarded the first time by the National Beauty Competition, a cruel prediction arose after the appearance in the bathing suit, which was supposed to be true at night. It was bottled that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize in order not to allow them to enjoy the crown.
Whether that is true or not, the fact is that Melina is starting today, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent in one of the international competitions on the appointment of the National Beauty Competition Colombia.
However, she will go into history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, had lost the crown.
So was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Lophoscopy from Cali went into history when the man who identified "Alfonso Cano" went into the story.
The work of these officials plays a key role.
On November 4th, a Lophoscopy of the Department of Public Prosecutors (CTI) from Cali as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Forces of Colombia): "Alfonso Cano" by comparison of fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists in the CTI department, this week Eliazar González had volunteered, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been involved in criminal investigations for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the communities of Chocó, where he often had to go to the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to Valle and after completing the necessary courses he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin that is exposed to friction, i.e. the palms of the hands and feet.
During the week of use against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was told to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big awaited him.
On Friday night, he flew to Cauca in the helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that there was a suspicion that one of the men who had led the oldest guerrilla in the world could be. Therefore, he should take the ten finger print from Guillermo León Sáenz (his actual name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was located with the exam, he could not identify it due to its physical appearance, since this was not the least similar to the pictures he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, wore no glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a plant cell and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body with those on the print sheet.
He had seen it right: it was "Alfonso Cano".
The same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of telling the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that it was actually the head of the FARC.
Looking for a trail
For a Daktyloskopen from Sijín in Cali, the tribute given by President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the engagement against "Cano" was very important.
Many people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science with no error rate, which can be a key factor in resolving a crime.
Lophoscopeists not only identify corpses, they also support investigations into murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
In their arrest, many offenders file false ID cards or they don't have any.
We'll take the fingerprints off them and find them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to tear a piece of wall out of a house at a thief’s house, because the thief had just leaned up with his hand at this point when he pulled out a safe filled with jewelry and money.
"walls are difficult because their surfaces are unsuitable for taking fingerprints. But in this case we could take the impression of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in several thefts," he remembered.
Fingerprints can also relieve or tax the suspects of murder.
Recently, a dead man was found surrounded by bottles of beak.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member could be suspected of suspecting and actually agreed to a fingerprint on the bottle.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, it is related to the place where the crime was committed.
A Dactyloscopy of the CTI stated that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical reagents would be taken from the object."
If they appear, a plant cell or a tape is used to take them.
After that, the impressions are sent to the Asif, which is the crime database, or to the residence.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without ID cards," said the expert from CTI.
He said that not everything was as it would appear in the TV series SCI.
Even as not all gold shines, not all you touch is a fingerprint.
But it can still be used if you make a corresponding comparison.
The "Empörten" demand the authorities in New York City
Hundreds of protesters conspired in tents on the Zuccotti square.
A large part of the city was taken up by the Space Command and changed its location to a nearby park.
On this Tuesday, members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement demanded New York's authorities when they tried again with a judicial order to enter the Manhattan Square after they had been cleared from the square in dawn and tried to occupy another place at the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators pressed in front of the Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get access with a judicial order that allowed the "employees" to reintroduce the tent at this place. Meanwhile, another part of the movement held on to the evacuation order and occupied a park further north of the city where there were nine arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the square, we will find ourselves in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the spokespersons of the movement "Ocupy Wall Street".
Bray explained that the response of the "employees" to the enclosure of their camp, which had been ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, mayor of New York, came to court where the judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning the violent enclosure of the square and authorising the protesters to the tent.
In addition, the "Empörten" occupied a new park, located at the intersection of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, connecting New York and New Jersey, and is the property of the Trinity Church.
They could occupy the place for at least an hour, but after that, the police arrived and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray cannot give precise figures. He assured the news agency Efe that he also saw several journalists with handcuffs.
The organization assures itself that there have been hundreds of people at this point, where there has also been a rejection of religious leaders as a sign of their support to members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti Square (a private property site) remains closed in anticipation of a judicial hearing, which is still open for this Tuesday, and in which the legality of the premises held in the morning grey is to be analysed.
Some of the demonstrators who were driven by the place carried photocopies of this judicial arrangement with them and distributed them. They even gave them some police officers who guarded the place, which resulted in "some small clashes" as Bray reported, who had indicated that some policemen had beaten demonstrators.
The court order forbids the authorities to remove members of Occupy Wall Street from the square as well as the application of "laws adopted after the occupation and forbid that the demonstrators return to the park with their tents and other things they had used before."
Mayor Bloomberg made it clear to the press that due to this judicial order the new opening of the square for public transport and the demonstrators had been lifted. The demonstrators pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to set up again with tents and sleeping bags in this place.
The mayor personally defended the premises of the Zuccotti Square, which had been arrested almost 200 people in the morning grey, and was decided because the demonstrators "rejected the right."
Bloomberg explained that he had given the arrangement to accommodate the place, because it had "turned into a place where people did not come to demonstrate, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm other people," for "some businesses would have had threats" and the residents feared "about their quality of life".
"The room in the morning grey was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting the financial interests and not in protecting the interests of North American workers," added the speaker of the movement, who accused the mayor of "not respecting the freedom of the press".
The leaders of "Occupy Wall Street" informed that they were thinking about organising "great actions" for Thursday, together with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests have lasted since 17 September.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary on the TV show
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will perform in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescue swimmer in "Baywatch", rabbit at "Playboy", woman of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a Christmas broadcast of Canadian television.
The private TV channel CTV announced today that Anderson will perform together with the "crooner" (balladen singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities on December 1st in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and will catch a very special virgin Maria's life.
CTV today spread pictures of the TV program, in which Anderson - also for the distribution on the Internet of a self-winded porn, in which she appears together with her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crue", Tommy Lee - as a virgin Mary with a doll in the lap to represent Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin, who recently worked as a moderator for the "My Violet Torpedo of Truth" program by Charlie Sheen, appears as Jesus' child.
The Christmas program of CTV is based not only on Anderson and Peters, but also on Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentinean model Luisana Lopilato at the end of March in Buenos Aires, and who is not far from this controversy.
Bublé recently named North American Kim Kardashian "Hure" at one of his concerts in New York.
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the free fall spirals from early March
Since the last March, the Japanese economy was paralysed, which was still in recovery after the destructive earthquake, which resulted in an atomic crisis, and the worst disaster Japan had experienced during World War II.
The first estimates of the government in Tokyo evaluated property damage to 300 000 dollars, a blow that seems to weaken despite the difficult economic situation in the world.
After three quarters, the data on gross domestic product from July to September finally concluded this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the rate calculated for the year.
The value measured in the second quarter - starting in Japan in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partly explained by the sale of machinery for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investment by 1.1% compared to the decrease by 0.9% for investments listed from January to March, the first decrease after six months of unsustainable growth.
Nevertheless, the actual economic upheaval of the Japanese economy is not based solely on Keynisian attacks that use the crisis to build up or reconstruct infrastructures.
Japan has been awakened, in particular, thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, driven by growing expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has relied on the domestic market after the yen - the Japanese currency - fled into one of the "currency currencies" of the investors, who fled from the euro zone's debt crisis and the turbulent forecasts for the U.S.A., a privilege burdened like a tombstone on exporting companies' accounts.
With a harder currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of major technology producers.
For example, Toyota and Sony returned their weak business results from July to September to the Yen listing.
While markets continue to besiege the peripheral EU countries, the government of Yoshihiko Noda remains vigilant.
"You have to pay attention to the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the rapid upgrading of the yen," said Motohisa Furukawa, State Secretary for Economic Policy yesterday.
The perspectives are really not very uplifting.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most Member States had clear indications of slowing down economic development in September.
The indicator, which presupposes the turning points of the world economy, revealed that the main economic potentials had slowed down.
Because it dropped by four tenths until it reached 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The euro area is even below this average, which is 100 after it has dropped by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens Makes Doubt Again
Papadimos says that the austerity measures would be adopted, but the Conservatives will not sign a written agreement.
With the high level of risk premiums from peripheral countries and widespread uncertainty, Greece continues to be lost in the labyrinth that results from the major European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is a reaction to the pressure from Brussels rather than a real conviction of political forces is slowly demonstrated by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, pointed out yesterday that there were no alternatives to the structural reforms and that the hundred days agreed upon in his appointment might be too short for their implementation, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras assured that he would support the new austerity measures and would not withdraw his request for new elections on the scheduled date, February 19.
"The most important task of this government is the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October," said Papadimos yesterday to open a parliamentary debate, which will reach its peak tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government.
A package of 24 employment promotion programmes, reform of the disciplinary law for officials and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
However, Samara's communication does not clear out the doubts about his position: "We have committed ourselves to the support of the transitional government, but otherwise we have nothing to do with it."
The conservative leader went one step too far with his challenge to the EU and the IMF, the organism that urgently needs Athens to unlock the 8000 million, and he made it clear that he would not agree to a declaration of commitments on the fulfilment of the austerity measures.
But the European Commission, still annoyed about the impact of the poker game with Papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that it was not necessary to respond to its demand: Economic assistance would not be signed if the new government and leaders of the main Greek parties were to sign "a clear written agreement not as soon as possible".
The spokesperson of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the inspectors of the Troika came back to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "which is "needed for 8000 million euros" for payment of the sixth section, although there is no final date.
The Greek knuckle has for a while more threads.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed Spain's "predominant" position with regard to this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a dominant position worldwide in the role of microfinance".
The Queen Sofía of Spain reminded yesterday that Spain has developed into a second donor worldwide for this means of international cooperation over the last two decades. This "Wesen" is based on the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and the hope for a better future for all humanity based on trust in people".
Yesterday the Queen inaugurated the fifth world summit on microcredit in Valladolid. She was convinced that there would be "no doubt" that this kind of business would be "absolutely necessary" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and "especially the goal of the number of persons who have to live with incomes of less than one dollar a day, thus below the "poverty limit".
Spain "also continues to work" on extending the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it carries out this task responsibly", said Queen Sofia, hoping that the initiatives and contributions that will be taken from the summit that will last until Thursday will be guaranteed "the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have seen many successes" and "we face many challenges."
The microcredit summit is not only a forum for debates but also a platform for "two basic objectives".
The Queen stated that it was intended that 175 million poor families should have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and that ten million of these households would cross the poverty line.
The concept of microcredit dates back in Spain and the rest of the world to the path initiated by Muhammad Yunus, which Queen Sofia considers to be a "act of justice and recognition".
The father of this financial instrument described it as an "admirable idealist who has dedicated herself to the fight against poverty" and whose work she has known for 15 years when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to get to know the loan strategy on the spot.
This experience followed one year later the first world summit in Washington and further meetings on the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. "We have all been able to observe a continuous development," said the Queen, whose commitment to this project brought her the assessment as "family head" in Valladolid yesterday and as "pre-speaker of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia finished her lecture by animateding those present to participate in the debate and to seek solutions in the fight against poverty.
Ethical Commandment
The Spanish Foreign Minister, Trinidad Jiménez, pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical requirement" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to bind development aid to economic booms at times, as it was a "permanent commitment".
Jiménez believed that micro-credit was a "serious and rigorous policy for eradicating poverty", and that the governments of the industrialised states would now have to work "more than ever" according to solidarity criteria, and should not allow solidarity to fall victim to the crisis.
For Spain, micro-credit is one of the most important forms of development aid.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, declared "the success", "marginalized" people, "who are always standing in front of closed doors" "hope" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city "your gates, infected by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the President of the EU on the basis of a general vote
The first day of the Congress of Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, November 14th in Leipzig) was for Angela Merkel, chancellor and chairman of the Christian Democratic Party, without any real difficulties.
The future of Europe was not originally foreseen in the programme, but it continued in autumn, particularly in order to provide sufficient resources for the activists who today and possibly Italy's tomorrow assess government policy in relation to the Greeks as too bad.
The European Commission's proposal, proposed by the Bureau, was adopted almost unanimously.
Among 1001 delegates, only nine had voted against, ten had abstained.
The standing ovation, which lasted several minutes, which initially concerned Angela Merkel and a few hours later Wolfgang Schäuble, due to their intervention leaks, was not open to any doubt on the part of the three European finance ministers.
The principal idea of the chancellor, as well as the requests, is the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be reflected in a strengthening modification of the Lisbon Treaty to the budget policy of the euro area countries by the control of the European Union, but this could also be reflected in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote"to give a face to Europe".
However, this is certainly one of the proposals adopted by Congress, which clearly stood Wolfgang Schäuble Pate.
Of course, it is unlikely that the 47 will agree quickly on this revolution: Great Britain is opposed to the issue, and the leaders of the CDU believe to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is the same opinion.
However, the milestone is laid.
Similarly, in an overwhelming majority, delegates have rejected the proposal of weighting each country in the Governing Council, in line with the weighting of individual economies, which is obviously an exacerbation of Germany's position.
The chancellor, based on the climate within her party, has therefore reinforced the points of reference of Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she has no longer tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in difficulty, which would immediately criticize the arrogant Germany.
In so far as the European request for the importance of the "German-French friendship" is devoted to a section, Angela Merkel does not call France on the plan.
At least not directly.
This reminds us that two centuries ago, Leipzig was at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does the fraud represent in the case of medical reports?
According to the family aid, UMP and the government are now launching the disease reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will meet in Bordeaux on Tuesday, 15 November in order to seek out a family support fund and give a speech on the theme of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence from the state - which has always been recurring since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is based on the desire to test the economy in a hard test, but on the other hand does not represent less foreshadowing an axis of the right presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on employee disease reports.
First of all, with budgetary objectives: the government is ordering the introduction of a fourth day of career before taking into account a disease report for private sector workers.
In good German, this means that a sick worker would lose the salary of four days without the consent of the specific company, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure which, according to the daily newspaper "Les Echos", threatens to excite anger, but would help to bring in 280 million euros.
And that with another measure was more symbolic: to grant the public officials an unpaid curfew in the event of a disease (so far, in contrast to the three days of the carnival in the private sector, there is no carnival time).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority also re-examines the issue of fraud, this time focusing on the abuses associated with absenteeism.
"Controls will be much more important, and in addition, they will be remunerated when this is required," Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, November 13th, in front of the channel RTL microphone.
As in other cases, the impact of this notification on the reality of fraudulent activities in the field of disease reports seems to be somewhat disproportionate.
In fact, this has been the subject of permanent observation since 2002 and of political offensives which have been the most fruitful.
The French are no more sick than people elsewhere in Europe.
First of all, however, we are staying with the nationwide numbers.
According to the CNAM national health fund, more than EUR 237 million of daily deposits were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Economic Research and Documentation in the Health Care Agency, daily settlements in 2008 represented EUR 11.3 billion as 5% of health expenditure.
This figure was 46% for maternity leave, accidents at work and 54% for sick leave, which is EUR 6.2 billion.
And thus 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French received an average of only 14.5 sick days compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group.
One average that obscures certain differences: another published, in 2007 by Monster.com, the Career Planning website, showed that 75% of the 40,000 surveyed French employees did not take a single sick day.
Another study, which is covered by health insurance, shows that 37% of reports in 2010 were of shorter duration than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
Compared to its European neighbours, the French workers tend to become incapacity for work no more than elsewhere.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French National Center for Science Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global rate of absenteeism (caused by disease or otherwise) was oscillating between 10% and 11%, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in the case of disease reports represents a negligible proportion of undeclared work.
With regard to fraud, only a weak measure is achieved here.
Strengthening legislation since 2002 means that there are systmatic checks in the case of disease reports that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public university for the education and training of technicians and engineers) found under 1.5 million controls that 13% of the 285,000 completed short-term medical reports, which is in 37,050 cases, were "unjusted or too long".
In the systematically controlled cases of more than 45 days duration, less than 1.2 million 11% were counted in "unadjusted or unwarranted" cases, which is 132,000.
All in all, this makes 169,000 "unwarranted" cases to several million workers who have filed a health report.
A figure which represents only a weak exception to, for example, those of undeclared work.
According to UMP member Dominique Tian, author of a report published in July on this issue, this represents between €9 and €15 billion tax loss per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore much more than the amount of the defraudation of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needs a new adjustment programme to catch up with its economy.
On Monday 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos had announced before Parliament, along with the fact that the one hundred days granted to his government by the Union were not enough to carry out this task.
"In order to continue the efforts to strengthen the economy, we need support from our European partners and a new programme for budgetary adjustment," said the head of government in his first public speech at the opening of the debate on Parliament's vote of confidence on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro Summit on 27 October was the "main task" of the new government, since the country's involvement within the Eurozone "is at stake" was as it added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos has planned to reduce the state deficit of the country"by 9%" of the gross domestic product from today to the end of the year, after this was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The rights reject the new savings
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had given his consent to the measures already approved in respect of one of the attempts to escape the debt crisis, but foresaw that his party would not be prepared for an additional savings.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said on the occasion of a assembly of parliamentarians from his New Democracy Party.
He had agreed to reduce budget deficits and debt, as well as to fight against waste, but was hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, with economic and monetary tasks entrusted to EU Commissioner, who had prevented IMF and EU from releasing the necessary loan of EUR 8 billion without a written guarantee from all parties on their support for the planned measures, Antonio Samaras had replied that his word would suffice and he would not sign anything under pressure from outside.
Euthanasia and accompanied free death must be legalised, as an expert body
The Canadians live in denial of death, as evidenced by a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors cooperated on pain relief treatment to provide the best pain relievers, and this goes beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in a renunciation attitude toward death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually insist on talking to their doctor about conditions under which they want to die and make dispositions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts were involved in various fields of expertise, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the criminal law so as to allow accompanied suicide and euthanasia where this choice is made, in the case of patients who are considered able to make such a decision.
As a starting point, the experts cite a recently published survey of the independent EIU society, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the globe.
Although Canada has placed itself in the 10th place, the study notes that "the medical care in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to cut the topic of death".
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians have no access to painkillers, so tell us the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the majority of Canadians' desire to die at home, 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
From a country-wide perspective, the rate at 86% of hospitalised deaths in Quebec is highest.
In the delicate question of euthanasia and accompanied suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that are opposed to the position of the federal government, which has already made no changes to the criminal law on euthanasia and accompanied suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have inspected all those countries whose approach has been legalised or decriminalized euthanasia and accompanied suicide, there is no evidence that such decriminalisation would result in abuses in their application, i.e. the practical implementation of euthanasia or accompanied suicide by unqualified or non-consenting persons.
On the contrary, much more cases of such offences have been dealt with especially in countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are not legalized, as confirmed yesterday by Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, in a teleconference.
"Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Also accompanied suicide is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal here," Jocelyn Downie explains.
Canadian Supports Euthanasia
We are aware that according to an Angus-Reid survey carried out in 2010, 85% of Canadians had already expressed themselves in favour of Euthanasia, as they believe that at the end of their life they allow people to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that the fact of legalizing euthanasia does not mean that the message is that the lives of elderly or disabled people have less value.
With regard to persons who have already practised a accompanied suicide, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
As regards the maintenance or withdrawal of the medicinal products in patients, the situation is less clear, according to the author of the report.
Similarly, in their list of recommendations, they suggest that the criminal law should specify that the suspension of the funds for which a legally valid refusal was made should not be considered a criminal offence.
The Expert Committee also calls for health professionals to be trained in the task of respecting the cessation of resources at the end of their lives, and this should be feared without criminal prosecution.
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together to provide the best pain relievers, and this was also beyond cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to the means already widely used in the Canadian institutions for health care, the panel calls for pain relief or life-absorbing measures to be considered, at least as little as euthanasia was used to reduce physical pain and to move on to the same procedures.
Subjects of other experts
Some health professionals have already made reservations about the conclusions of the Royal Society of Canada's expert report.
RA Pierre Deshamps, a specialist in health law, has referred to the opinion of the reporting experts as "extreme" among other things, since they set no limits on euthanisation practice in the end-stage.
"This opens the doors to a situation in which anyone who is tired of life and older than 18 years of age asks another person to help him in his suicide," said RA Deshamps, who had read a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also emphasises that the authors of the report seemed to place the individual's own responsibility over all other values involved in the social fabric of society.
But now, he says, there were "guidelines and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, a specialist in health law, has also expressed "a strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report which she referred to as "Pro-Euthanasia Manifesto".
Margaret Somerville, himself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, doubts in particular the reports on the absence of abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are legalized, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to resign
Damascus plans a "compilation"
Syria is more isolated than ever.
The partisans Baschar al-Assads demonstrated before the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday.
The diplomatic pressure on Syria Bashar al-Assads, which, however, opposes it thanks to Russia's support and shows a "compilation" directed against the country, has been strengthened yesterday.
Two days before the end of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union stepped up its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring countries of Syria, had taken a position in favour of a resignation from President Assad.
Last night, King Abdullah II of Jordan was the Arab Prime Minister in charge, who had asked President Bashar al-Assad to "put down his office in Syria" in which the forty civilians and members of the government were already killed.
"Having Bashar's interest in his country in the heart, he would resign, but in addition he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of political Syrian life," said the King of Jordan, neighboring Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish diplomat Ahmet Davutoglu had complained that the Turkish mediation attempts directed at the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been successful.
"Those in the Middle East who are not in peace with their people and cannot be satisfied with this need to go," he explained in an illustration of Syria, the neighbouring country, to which Turkey is taking a constantly moving attitude.
The United States, for its part, has welcomed the "dissemination of the Consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" as a result of the Arab League and the European Union's decisions.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries like Turkey have struck an ever sharper tone in the face of repression in Syria," says Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government in the region of Dar'a in the South of Syria have died, according to the Syrian Observatory on Human Rights OSD.
According to this NGO, two more civilians had been killed in the besieged city of Homs by the shifts in the shots and heavy bombings of Jobar.
At a press conference, Syrian Foreign Trade Minister Walid al-Muallim nevertheless felt that the country "taxes towards the end of the crisis".
Incidentally, he responded with emphasis on the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from its tasks, which, in his opinion, is a "dangerous step".
Syria "will not yield," he added under the suspicion that "the plots forged against Syria would fail".
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently examining a "protection mechanism for civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organisations, the media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Trade Minister Alain Juppé had also expressed himself in favour of sending UN observers to assist civilians against regime repression, encapsulating themselves in his "Paranoia" to protect them.
An extraordinary reconvening of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan on crisis recovery adopted on 2 November, in particular the controversial, expected withdrawal of military troops from the besieged cities and the liberation of prisoners of demonstrators.
The Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lawrow considered the decision of the Arab League yesterday to be "uncorrect" in order to prevent possible sanctions against Damascus, although China had already advised Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti calls on the markets for patience and Italy to be willing to sacrifice
Mario Monti, future Italian head of government has demanded a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program that "sacrifices" demand to regain the creditworthiness lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner had held a negotiation with the political parties yesterday before today's trade unions and employers' union meeting.
It was his job to convene a cabinet in Parliament, which is relatively strict from external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme involving a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, Member of one of the numerous smaller parliamentary groups involved in the discussions after meeting with the President-in-Office of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, had hoped that Mr Monti would give Parliament a vote of confidence by Friday to make sure that the new government had sufficient support.
The agreements will be culminated in the presentation by M. Monti of a strike list, which will undoubtedly extend from a dozen ministers to Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that yesterday's nervousness of the stock market and bond markets demanded her time.
In "a democracy there are certain deadlines", to prepare a government and a government programme, he stressed that it was "safe that the markets would be weak and coherent".
His appointment by the President was welcomed at the outset by the markets, but the unrest had increased on that occasion, especially after an unexpected industrial production decline in the Eurozone in September.
The prime minister was to establish a staff consisting mainly of technocrats, although he had stressed that he would like to include "politicians".
The new government should exist only until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive Parliament's confidence by Friday.
Since taking up his role, M. Monti has been committed to working in all urgency in the sense of the objective of making Italy a "new protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesperson of EU Commissioner Olli Rehn had stressed that "it does not change our diagnosis of the Italian economy itself, taking into account the new government".
In particular, the EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its budgetary balance target in 2013, despite the savings plans that have been adopted in recent months, has asked for new issues.
Emma Marcegaglia",Chefin of the Chiefs of Italy, who will meet at Monti on Tuesday, also insists on the need for economic boosting", as a country that has no growth that cannot respect the deficit figures."
M. Monti, who is known for his competence and independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for an "Epoch Change" in Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "Professor" symbolises the "challenge of trustworthiness" and a "other Italy", said the editorial authors.
The great unknown was the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent previous elections, as Italy has now raised EUR 200 billion of government bonds until April 2012.
Russian scientists are helping the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Wjatscheslaw Danilenko, helped Iran develop a nuclear explosive capsule, so on Monday confirmed an American NGO specializing in nuclear risks.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Safety Agency (AIEA) and other documents from this UN agency to determine this scientist.
The AIEA had announced its "serious concern" last week on the occasion of a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to in-depth study of AIEA documents by ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, had apparently worked in a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) for over three decades since the beginning of the 1960s and was involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he should have left the centre to start a company in Kiev, which produces "Nano-diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he then participated in an Iranian program from 1996 to 2002.
In her last report, the AIAA"strong indications were that the Iranian development" of a nuclear explosive system" had been supported by the work of a foreign expert who was not only ill-advanced in this technology but also, as a member of the agency announced, his entire professional career had worked directly on the military nuclear programme of his country of origin, above all indispensable to this technology."
Anti-Islamic crimes and crime have increased by 50%
The crimes and crimes targeted against Muslims have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, whereas other racist or religiously motivated crimes of violence, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday, have either declined slightly or increased slightly over the same period.
According to this data, the total number of crimes committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. 49%, whereas a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in Jewish-directed crimes, and a global increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and crimes was recorded.
The total number of "hass-motivated crimes" has risen to 6,628 cases, including 47.3% due to racial differences and 20% motivated by religious differences of crimes, according to the FBI.
"After a weakening in 2009, it is worrying to see these crimes grow again," stressed the Human Rights Organization first."The increase in anti-Islamic acts of violence is particularly significant," added the organization in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First had stressed for a long time that the violence directed against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be regarded as a serious violation of human rights," added Paul Legendre, an organist in charge.
"The US government can and should do more to combat these attacks," he added, with an assessment that this could be done by improving the police's attitude towards "hat crimes".
The "hat crime" is a legacy of the struggle for civil rights in American federal law.
This legislation had been passed after Martin Luther Kings' death to punish acts of violence directed against race, skin color, religion or descent and now also involves crimes of sexual affiliation.
Twitter transforms the platform and resembles more and more Facebook
On Monday, the Microblogging website Twitter introduced changes in the presentation of its platform in order to enable its users, in particular, to observe the activities of those following their entries, which makes the service more similar to that of Facebook.
The new tab "Activity" and another "Name" enable better readable live tracing of the activities of other "Twitter", the Internet user, whose news ("Tweets") is being tracked and your news is being tracked.
This makes it possible to find out whether these allow them to track their news, whether they subscribe to new posts, favour certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer had been tested with a small percentage of users prior to its general Internet distribution on Monday" in August", said Twitter spokesperson Carolyn Penner in front of the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive function, equipped with a somewhat esotherically suggestive word (RT for referencing repetition of the contribution of another person). followfreeday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiativeés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus compatible a celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
In the network, users debated this innovation via the Internet with the help of certain "tweets".
"This is useless, intrusive and resembles too much Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The function "Activity" will help me to better track certain elements of my Flux Twitter," said @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Entry of a "golden budget rule" into the Constitution
The government of the great Social Democratic/Christian Democratic Coalition, which is in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to include a "Golden Budget Rule" in the Constitution in order to reduce public deficits and also to avoid possible degradation by rating agencies in Austria's top-bonity (AAA).
It was the social-democratic chancellor Werner Faymann personally who had announced this decision on the outcome of the Council of Ministers, although the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, far above the 60% criterion laid down by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debt levels of the countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's ability to pay did not fall to AAA on AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros of interest each year," argued Michael Spindeleger, Vice Chancellor and Christian Democratic Außenminister.
Austria also issued a call for the Brussels Eurozone Member State Summit of 26 October: the Heads of State and Government would then have demanded the inclusion of the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or by the adoption of an equivalent law.
The measure taken by the Austrian Government is similar to the "German model" since Germany was the first European country to have incorporated such a "rule" into the Constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should decrease by 0.75% of the gross domestic product (GDP) each year; from 2017 onwards, the government's structural budget deficit should not exceed the 0.35% threshold of GDP, whereas regional governments as well as municipalities should have balanced households.
The aim is to eliminate budgetary debt under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Agreement in the 2020/21 horizon.
Starker Yen
Noda threatens with a new intervention on the currency markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese force would intervene again in the monetary markets if the yen continued to rise.
"If we establish excessive volatility in the Yen exchange rate", we will intervene as we did the last time," explained M. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the Yen was again speeded up to the historical levels that the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on October 31st.
That day Tokyo had sold Yen massively against the dollar to lower the Japanese foreign exchange value, which is in the process of taxing a new record value against the dollar since 1945.
However, the yen has increased regularly over it, immersed by purchases of investors who regard the yen as a "admissibility" in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell on Tuesday under 77 yen, the euro among the symbolic latte of 105 yen was blown close to the levels that the last intervention had taken.
Prior to the financial crisis 2008-2009, the dollar recorded the 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This Japanese currency straw fire damages the exports of the archipelago, as it costs the "Made in Japan" products and reduces the income of Japanese companies from abroad, as they exchange them in national currency.
"Japan fights after the earthquake and the tsunami on March 11 which devastated the Tohoku region (North East) for its reconstruction," emphasizes M. Noda, who fears that this expensive yen could already kill the weak upswing in the germ.
With growth in the third quarter, the third world economic power has gained -1.5% for the first time this year, compared to the previous quarter, thanks to the rise in exports and the consumption of households "plombed" by the disaster.
The Prime Minister estimates, however, that the economic growth of the yen does not reflect the economic foundations of Japan.
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, has invited the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to offset this situation.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, Deputy Governor of the Institute, informed that the BoJ had already launched "appropriate measures" which made it apparent that no additional reduction in the currency would be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the central bank had increased its government bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to raise the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) cover amounts it had spent on various purchases of finance to flood the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest rate feet speed up to the height, stock exchanges make withdrawals
The risk of the debt crisis is constantly undermining European indicators.
Despite the launch of the new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as the best growth rates in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue to increase steadily.
The stock exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the Eurozone, also operate this Tuesday, November 15, a little more in negative terms.
The CAC lost 1.4% in Paris at 10 a.m. and fell to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt went back 0.4%, London 0.1%.
"Due to the new tensions over the yields of government bonds in the euro area in difficulty, global stock markets continue to produce some of their recent profits.
"The capital investors are nervous and only too well aware of the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the Reuters press agency.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which in turn suffers from the renewed fear of European market participants of the capacity to continue the debt crisis, had closed with a cashier of 0.7%.
"Japan, as well as the rest of the world, has focused its eyes on Europe, and trade is moving on a limited corridor of variation, as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilized," estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This revival of concern about the future of the Eurozone is damaging to the single currency, which continues its Baiss on Tuesday.
The euro has been moving at its lowest level for one and a half months.
At 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1,3570 dollars, leaving it at 0.4%.
According to the stockbrokers, it went back after the CDU, the party of chancellor Angela Merkel, who had gathered at Congress on Monday, had accepted an application which provided for the possibility, in particular, of withdrawing from the euro zone in difficult countries, without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% limit.
The interest rates in Italy and Spain continue to be very worrying.
This Tuesday morning the yield of the Italian bonds reached 6.85% in 10 years, the Spanish title matured to 6.2%.
These tensions in interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of investors.
The future Italian head of government Mario Monti called for more time from the markets to restore the situation threatened by paralysis in Italy.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos had confirmed, for his part, that the implementation of the decisions taken on 27 October at the Eurozone Summit was "the main task" of his government.
Spain is located in the Visir of the Markets, as the parliamentary elections take place on Sunday in the country.
The spread between the German and Spanish 10-year commitments has once again reached a new historical high.
Anticipating Eurozone growth rates
Statistically, France accounted for 0.4% of household-based economic growth in the third quarter, slightly better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office INSEE had revised the Baisse's figures for the second quarter, with a decrease of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In truth, it is the fourth quarter that the economic experts are most concerned about.
Germany, on the other hand, had a 0.5% growth over the same period.
A first calculation of the total euro area is expected at 11 a.m., with the EU Commission warning of the risk of a further recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should prevail over dogmas
If a topic does not exist on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, this is certainly the energy policy.
The availability and costs of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies.
It is reasonable to have an electoral meeting on this subject and to think about the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it explores the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution is leading to a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, a huge proportion of the world's population should not have to renounce a vital element.
At the same time, it is necessary to mitigate the shortage of fossil resources in order to continue to be able to produce electricity consistently, without the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to forget an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate in order to fight against climatic irregularities.
The accident of Fukushima does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains isolated in its decision to refrain from nuclear power.
This is neither the case in Belgium, which makes its decision subject to the need to find a substitute source of substitution, nor in Switzerland, which is just about to build nuclear power plants of the last generation.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name just a few countries, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
On the other hand, the United States decided to attract another unit after Fukushima by re-establishing the Three Mile Island plant that was shut down after the nuclear accident.
Although the German model is sometimes set as a model for renewable energy sources, reality does contradict the discourse.
The elections in Berlin will take the form of an increase in the price of electricity, an increase in energy dependence, particularly on Russia, by means of the increased use of imported gas, a rise in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal-fired power plants.
The totality of these unpleasant effects will already become apparent within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives rise to reflection.
Denmark, on the one hand, is a European leader in wind energy, from which it derives 30% of its electricity; on the other hand, the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, alternately used with wind energy; on the other hand, its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
Thanks to the stability of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill in contrast to our French households.
As the price of energy in the globalised economy is a key role of competitiveness and an industrial stability path on national soils, French companies have an advantage due to the most favourable electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore result in a strong increase in the price of energy, which will lead to the illusion of the noble statements about the reindustrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
Surveys showed that this is a price which the vast majority of French people are as unwilling to pay, as it shows resistance to the principle of this source of energy.
Let us remember that the energy policy of our country has enabled us to build an industrial sector with 125.00 direct jobs and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a large number of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises to the international markets and makes them the creators of countless jobs.
If France were to take the decision to withdraw from nuclear power, the bulk of these SMEs would fall victim to this, and the annual EUR 6 billion of investment and nuclear energy exports would be increasingly shrinking.
What electrician would commission an EPR designed to function for sixty years if its producer's decline was preprogrammed?
In order to solve the energy equation, one has to admit that there is just as little as a devil's work as a miracle agent for the production of electricity.
The low-carbon solutions developed by the Areva company for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy testify to the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France we have carried out a safety authority that performs uncompromising and transparent controls in existing works, such as building in Flamanville.
Their work teams, who have made a name for themselves because of their professionalism, are currently obsessed with the security vision.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents.
Only one person, in Three Mile Island, entered the market under normal operating conditions, without any consequences for man and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was challenged by reactor construction as well as indebted human failure.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident of two natural disasters has never been caused by the mass that caused the death of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw its lessons from this accident, as it had done after the two previous ones.
As a result of this approach, as well as the cooperation of the safety authorities of the French and German operators and constructors of nuclear power plants, the EPR represents a design that enables it to withstand such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among the electrical engineers to build a nuclear power station, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by allowing them free train to travel the leading position in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy boiquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and party manoeuvre dominate a debate that also determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticised from many angles - overburden of police, judicial and administrative bodies due to a policy subject to the figures, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights", as France had called itself.
Recently, the harassment directed against foreign students on the part of the authorities had marked the weekly shows, and the Minister of the Interior (see Libération of 23 May) announced that France "needed no talents, maurers or waitress from abroad".
But this policy was rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus on this issue between the right and the left.
On the right, Jacques Chirac's tone, which had declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed, including more than 2 million immigrant workers, are not likely to pose a problem for a country," on the left by Michel Rocard, who had stated in 1990, "could not absorb the whole poverty of the world".
There is only one difference in the degree of inertia.
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by Horden Polish plumber was shared both from the right and from the left in 2005.
From both camps the immigrants were treated as a burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference is the degree of initiative that immigrants are willing to face.
In his programme, Francois Hollande is limited to banalities, which indicate that partnership development allows us to solve our "migration problems".
This notion of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on the elections, but it is economically costly.
As Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron showed us in a recent work that summarizes the latest findings on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 S.), there is a broad consensus among specialists regarding the positive impact of the immigrant flood on economic growth, wages and jobs in the countries of immigration.
Immigration would reduce growth and damage the labour market situation.
The fears about the influence of migrants are based on the idea that they threaten to substitut the local workers, especially the less qualified, by exerting pressure on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that immigrants are, in fact, much more complementary than local wage workers, since they are engaged mainly in occupations in sectors that are technically unexploited.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors where local wage-earners are not interested, the more skilled among immigrants are working in dynamic sectors where training is not aligned with the job offer.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, this complementarity also has a positive effect on wages and the domestic labour market situation between locals and migrants.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in the influx of immigrants causes a co-related, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas gained by immigrants and economic growth is beneficial (high proportion of immigrants who have been resident among American Nobel Laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to social systems, in the European countries on average around 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organisation estimates that a person who is aged 30 to Germany makes a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of around EUR 150,000 to the public budget on average over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished to produce the missing cutting points with the teeth at the time of his mandate.
These said teeth, which the immigrants were supposed to deter, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now remains to think through European democracy
Democracy is a valuable good; it is also a delicate good.
The European continent should be able to recall who, after their invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had suffered the whole of the 20th century about the tragedies of the First World War, Totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, and also Franco in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Supreme Court in Greece.
Some had probably believed that it was rich enough to exercise the right to vote, in the most direct way possible, to see democracy defeated once and for all over its enemies.
Since Napoleon "the little one" it has been known that it was a feature of mental attitude.
The general electoral right, which constitutes the necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient for this and can just as well become the "repressive instrument", as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot put it at that time.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of powers, education, education, economic and social community spirit, a case-law.
The crisis in Europe, in which we are in, is an economic crisis, but it is also a major political and democratic crisis.
In this respect, the transformation of the Greek True-Falsch referendum would have had a twofold distinct character: once that the need for a powerful return of politics, on the other hand, but also those of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, its inadequacy.
This ambivalence should be considered overtaken.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have moved today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, no longer aim in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain to push for a success of the national referendum, which was organized in accordance with the needs and in the wrong order.
A free pass for the European ruler or a jump with connected eyes into the void of nationalist withdrawal: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want Hackebeil, but a collective task, out of full law, clarified and constantly, a choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - one no longer knows where to end the list - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is Europe as a whole that is bowing to the dictates of the markets and the credit rating agencies that are suffering from its lack of power and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated at international level.
There is concern about transfers of sovereignty towards Europe - it is a whole Europe that is gradually losing its sovereignty, and therefore every one of its nations.
The urgency is to give back to the popular sovereignty the leadership of the European project.
For it is up to the whole community to see whether Europeans can reduce the burden of their debt, free themselves from the markets and open up a future through investment.
The exit from the crisis has led to decisions at European level, which cannot be allowed to fall without total democratic legitimacy, without leading us safely to ruin.
After this proposal by Jacques Delors and the Socialists has been over for a long time, everyone today urges European economic governance to do so.
Agreed.
But without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it presupposes the citizens - this would be a new folly and a further dead end.
We need to take on a new stage of European construction.
In order to create the Republic in France, it required the creation of Republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not do enough here.
This instruction remains valid.
We need to form a better integrated Europe at economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a more politically democratic Europe, a truly European people's sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards become the general good
The World Trade Fair for Chip Cards opens its doors on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an optimistic attitude.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 was expected to end with an 11% increase in worldwide sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM card phones), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important segment is the contactless technology that allows payments in public transport or payment of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Compared to the 320 million sold a year earlier, 460 million contactless chip cards worldwide were to be sold this year!
Their market share should increase even further in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent more than 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground in the matter of contactless payment after it has long been lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visas have been distributed.
Consumer markets, however, make steam.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contactless pass MasterCards this year.
In order to move faster, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers with these cards.
"Two large French financial institutions have committed themselves to systematically issuing their customers with contactless chip cards in the future," announced Gérard Néboy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks Test Payment by Mobile Phone
However, this is only a first step on the way to the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
A decreasing percentage of devices has so far been equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology required to carry out these transactions.
"They're delayed."
"But at least next year they should experience a real upward trend."
"We expect sales of 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, Chairman of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the initiative.
The Crédit Agricole had announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that allows for contactless payment.
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And also the Société Générale had yesterday announced that it would be possible to prepare the market launch of an offer that would allow their customers to pay contactless by mobile phone.
Terrorist front understands itself, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relations between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram.
The long-standing relationship between the al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seems to confirm itself.
On Sunday, Algerian Vice-Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers had now gained "certainty".
"The way in which both organizations and the relationship between secret services are acting indicates clear cooperation," he explained without further ado.
Paris seems to be making a similar analysis.
The investigations of the abduction of two Frenchmen in the Niger last January have supported interfaces on a daily basis.
The Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by supporters of the Aqmi are expected to have been killed on the following day at the same time as several of their kidnappers on the occasion of an operation carried out by the French special units.
French and Nigerian investigators want to have found several telephone chips in the debris at the site that belonged to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the led telephone calls leads to several interlocutors stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France International (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one number leads to a Nigerian who had stopped for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered to be the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but one must undoubtedly wait for clearer evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem".
"It is, however, imaginable".
"It has been known for years that the sect has received financial and intellectual support from outsiders and that it is increasingly active," says Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuuwo.
In recent months, these "support services" have become increasingly visible in their course, as have the speeches and the operations modes of Boko Harem, which now point to the withdrawal of suicide bombers as well as the use of ever more complex explosives, which carry the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
Since then, the international community, starting with Washington, has put pressure on Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have indeed for a long time considered the grouping to be a community of Illuminati, which should not be given special attention.
Fast Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri in the vicinity of a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means so much in Haoussa as "Western education is a disgrace" - pursues the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this mediocre region, the merger is experiencing rapid successes.
It is politically committed and demands strict respect for the Sharia, while the activists who are associated with it are engaged in the fight against the godless central government.
The activists first have churches, bars and authorities in the vision.
In 2009, Boko Haram's activists were particularly active in their intensified attacks against the Commissioners.
Abuja's reaction is, however, as usually indicated.
The army surrounds the city, one counts 800 dead.
Muhammad Yusuf, taken captive, is being killed in prison.
As a result, the cult becomes more radical and leaves its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas she confessed to an assassination in Jos, who demanded 80 lives, then to another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is assigned the guilt of a suicide attack that took place in Abuja's secured police headquarters - the first of its kind.
In August, the local seat of the United Nations became a priority international target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is to lead from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia, has been worrying about all security experts since then.
While the Aqmi has occupied Mali and the Niger to operate the Somalis of al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Harem on the occasion of a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria and was ready to make a statement."
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
In the midst of Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry, there is a rivalry in simplification and ignorance of China, Iraq and Israel.
Can a crisis-affected America lead a complex world with simple to say, not to say, simple ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidate, the voters could get almost that impression.
For a number of days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their associates have repeatedly made their thunderous statements and their statements about autism, a traditional republican focus.
About China, Iran and Israel help often fall - often in no way undermined - slogans.
With regard to the appointment of the "Grand Old Party" at the highest price, Mitt Romney threatened to quote the Chinese before the WTO and to accuse them of the "maintenance manipulation" - the leading issue in an America that is most exasperated by the emigration of entire industries to Asia.
He said it was stupid to imply the launch of a trade war.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of autism, has almost cut off the air with regard to his emotions of flattering gesture.
He had called for a firm but constructive discussion with Beijing (also Obama's current attitude).
But Huntsman is not heard as he stagnates in the depths of the polls.
Reagan's image
Romney had also pledged military strikes against Iran in case the sanctions for halting the nuclear programme failed.
"If I am elected, I command Iran to stop," he had spoken.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll get the bomb."
In addition, he promised Israel increased military aid and charged Obama with remaining guilty of this partner's obligations.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second highest-ranking candidate, has a disgraceful documentary on his part.
Recently, he called on the Chinese military threat to counter, since Beijing's attempts to develop a nuclear power" - and seemed to pay attention to the fact that China has already been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
The Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military strikes against Iran, is willing to engage the U.S. Army against drug cartels in Mexico.
The 2009 Obama's refusal to resort to torture against suspected terrorists was also supported by Cain, Perry and Michele Bachmann's candidacy.
It is far away from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, a very political weight.
The current presidents opposed the fact that Reagan also had simple ideas and, despite all of this, won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and had to pour water into his wine, which was the subject of antiterrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive interlocutory with Iran, the premature withdrawal of his "boy" from Iraq, his indecisiveness in Libya, which also brought him the call of weakness.
This hostility, however, is not quite so coercive.
The population rather appreciates the positive balance of national security under Obama, which Bin Laden has turned off.
Since Iraq, she has been guarding herself against military interventions that lead to paralysis.
And Obama surprises more appropriately by arguing that America had to be reconstructed economically in order to revive its leadership position.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the Baltic seabed and connects Western Europe directly with Russia, has been put into operation.
It is intended to supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to perform this event with brilliance and Gloria.
Over 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, have lived last Tuesday on the Baltic Sea coast under orchestral sound and at fine-tasting buffets the opening of the new North Stream gas pipeline that connects Russia and Germany directly below sea level.
The German chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte have symbolically combined the steering wheel of the valve, which carries the Russian gas into the Western European network.
With the new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year will be delivered to Western Europe through a first 1224 km long pipeline linking the region of St Petersburg with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second pipeline, which allows a total supply of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of total French consumption - is due to be completed by the end of 2012.
And you already let the possibility of building a third line ring on your own track.
For Gazprom, the timely and punctual completion of this huge building seems like a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord-Stream pipeline will allow for direct gas delivery to Germany, while avoiding any trajectory through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on the highway.
For this reason, these two countries lose a little of their power: for them, it is now more difficult to exert pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, the strongest in the debate, was not shy away from comparing the North Stream pipeline with a "new German-Swiss Pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically too sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply through the support of this Russian project.
However, this is at the expense of defusing European energy, as the project has broken the gap between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has completed its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, Western countries, which have strong gas consumption and whose gas reserves are running low in almost five years.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way," confirmed François Fillon at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, pointing to the degree to which the major gas contracts are also important from a political and economic point of view.
All this explains the broad smile of the many Gazprom Managers represented in Lubmin regarding the gas pipeline.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater pipe consists of steel with concrete lining, which is intended to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the seabed, at about 200 m deep.
During her construction, minefields dating from World War II had to be balanced.
"A hundred mines had to be removed or destroyed for a precaution," Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream, said.
In addition, stronger measures had to be taken to protect fauna and flora.
The line is a long hose made of metal, heavy like 242 Eiffel Towers, which is interrupted by nothing over the entire length: neither by valves, nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off Sweden's coast, but project managers have deviated from it because Sweden was little interested in seeing a Russian state company settle in a permanent manner at the level of its coasts.
"In the case of a disaster, we close the gas passage in less than a minute," Jens Müller explained.
In the event of a leak, the gas in the gas pipeline thus escapes into the air.
However, this case is considered unlikely by the constructors, since the tails were estimated to have a leak per 100,000 years.
The state monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured by both an underwater robot, which is controlled for external observation by a seaship, as well as by a device that circulates inside the gas pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigar, a meter diameter, is introduced into the inside of the pipe and is moved through the gas pressure.
After three complete days of forward movement through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information about any deformations of the metal upon arrival.
The gas pipeline was designed to work for fifty years without even having to undergo the slightest repair.
Gas circulation is easily ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entrance, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five societies have united their forces to achieve this project.
However, the management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
In addition, the German companies E.ON and BASF (each 15.5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (each 9%) are affiliated here.
These five companies have formed a business community called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom has then rented the entire capacity of its gas transport to extendable twenty-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the real transporter gas quantity fails," Jens Müller explained.
The financing of gas pipeline construction has been secured to 30% by shareholders and to 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of labour should be EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amount was 240 million.
However, minority shareholders are willing to recover their expenses, as Gazprom alone bears the liability risk.
The gas pipeline rises on a sandy coastline with pines forested by Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5 meter-high valves form the gas outlet outlet.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other key figures of the incoming gas before it is passed on to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been delivered with 1 million cubic metres of Russian gas per hour.
With full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic metres per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a trademark notebook.
Moleskine wants to give the letter a new style of writing from an Italian company about fifteen years ago.
It has a flair of adventure, candlelight with the writing hours.
The notebook of Moleskine is easily recognizable, with its black, rectangular ribbon, rubber band, egg-shell sides, as over time.
The Moleskin Notebook, as it is known today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which is based in Milan, decided to bring a distraught design notebook to the market at the time.
Maria Sebregondi, then specialist consultant of the company, is commissioned to introduce the new product on the market.
The notebook was inspired by an old-fashioned production technique called Mole Skin (mole skin), which denotes a cotton varnish used for, for example, cushion benches.
This type of notebook was very much in demand among writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten object that was considered an icon of avant-garde artist until the 20th century," explains Maria Zebregondi, now brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success occurs.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales rose by 26% and established with a sales volume of 12.7 million units.
This is far from the usual production of the first years in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine passes the Italian border and is exported in 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to make a phantom picture of the buyers, as the notebook inspires businessmen as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultivated and open-minded customers.
The small, Italian company, which counted 12 employees in its beginnings, today employs over 100 employees and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in bookstores, on Internet portals such as Fnac, in small shops of the city centers and is committed to enforcing its identity.
"We have followed the spirit of time and his new need for writing, which exists despite the upswing of e-mails," said Maria Zebregondi.
This cultural characteristic is accompanied by the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition called "Detour (Umweg)", in which architects and artists issued their own notebooks.
In August, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival, the company also brought a tape with leopard patterns to the market.
Moleskine benefited from his success and this cultural Zeitgeist and understood to diversify his products: bags, appointments calendar, fillers, computer cases... The brand shows the entire range of articles.
A success that brings neider to the plan: In autumn 2006, Modo Modo was bought up by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, and thus opened a new chapter in Moleskine's history.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers so high?
Approximately 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today begins the "15th week of work for disabled people".
Despite a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled people is always twice as high as the average: 19% against 9% of the total population.
Discouraging?
"No, Éric Blanchet, Director-General of the Adapt Association, emphasizes the "week of work for the disabled".
"The progress made within fifteen years is considerable."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not double, but three times as high."
"Nevertheless, a great deal remains to be done."
However, it must be said that disabled people continue to face many obstacles before they get a job.
It is more common for the elderly: 37% are over 50 years of age (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them have no qualifications and there are only 10,000 disabled among the 2.3 million students with higher education qualifications.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% for disabled people compared with 38% in total.
In short, there are so many criteria which make it difficult to re-enter work and which constitute the "core of the problem", said Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992, which helps companies to acquire disabled workers.
So much for the actual brakes.
Keep the unspoken, the mental attitudes, which are certain, but are slowly evolving.
A study carried out in April by the Association IMS-Entreprendre for the magazine La Cité indicated that the managers in question have "a weak level of knowledge regarding disabled persons", which "overrepresents" being "of persons in wheelchairs, mental or intellectually disadvantaged persons".
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go in order to achieve the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, as laid down in a 1987 law.
These latter figures from 2008 refer to a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now in for the 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the organization that is responsible for bringing in contributions from companies that do not respect this law.
Proof: The number of "payable" establishments has decreased, as has the sum of the paid-in amounts between 2007 and 2011, i.e. from 59.000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which provides for increases in contributions, created strong pressure on companies," said Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also brings true recognition, particularly in the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of establishments employ disabled persons between 20 and 49 people, while enterprises with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: "What a happiness"
Even before they offered the "Blue Tuesday evenings (20:45) the forehead, Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had not forgotten their pleasure that brought them the game of friendship.
It would be too far taken to claim that there has been a secret agreement between them, but the image speaks symbolic volumes.
On the side of the audience podium of the Stade de France sitting George Leekens and Eden Hazard would have been happy to make peace.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had reaped nothing but praise for his person.
"I am very pleased with Eden, its progress and the fact that it is Belgian."
"I want to look forward," the native Liller assures his side.
As to the contrast between his presentation in club and national elf"It's a unit that justifies everything."
"I am in Lille all year, which is not the case in Belgium".
"It's time for me to get started."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, brought Friday evening against Romania regarding the match against France to finally "glare".
However, without leaving the note of "rejoicing".
The French national team has fired him since he was seven years old, and he led his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This inevitably helps to strengthen the "unique" character of this encounter.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuky), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he recalls.
"We just crossed the road."
"To be able to play means great luck!"
Leekens, on the other hand, made a sound of kindness "stolz".
"The Pride of a Galamatch."
"Stolz" also to confirm - in its capacity as "native children" - that France "has once again become a team at a very high level", and that little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done damn good work," he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician is very likely to see the plane sharing with the Blue (French national elf) ... towards Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians come out big," he stressed.
"We're planning one thing, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll notice that in the upcoming games." The game against France included.
Portugal is very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento, with great optimism, opposes the return game against Bosnia (22:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the playoff, both teams had missed the point of fact.
"At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and above all a happy country".
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that "La Selecçao", his national elf, for whom he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, this means in fact only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play and serve an opponent, namely Bosnia.
Given the hint (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica it seems obvious that the cubes have not yet fallen.
Portugal clearly dominated the party for more than an hour, but the team was unable to put the matter down so important a stamp that would have taken the pressure from it.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain risk, because we have not achieved a forward door".
At home, however, in their brightly shining Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to go through in front of an audience as hot as the game, even though the game was of course announced as "very close," said optimistic but clear Bento.
"We expect a very tight match, but we are absolutely convinced that we can win the upper hand," said 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance at the 2012 European Championship," said Carlos Queiroz' successor.
The decision on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to achieve and win a goal.
A decision can already suffice the Bosnians, who also need a gate.
"This is a good result, but it poses a certain risk, because we have not achieved a forward door," laments Bento.
"We will compete against a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities," he added.
As already in Zenica, the Portuguese had already at first put maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "give them no time to think."
A good idea, provided that it is put into practice this time.
