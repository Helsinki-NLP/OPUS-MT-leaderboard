28-year-old chef found in San Francisco Mall dead
A 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping center.
The victim's brother said he can't imagine anyone wanting to hurt him, "Finally it went up again with him."
The body found in the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, and reported to the forensics department in San Francisco.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and investigations are ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABS Sender KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who worked as a chef in Boston earlier, had found his dream job six months ago as a cook at the Sons & Daughters Restaurant in San Francisco.
A speaker of the Son & Daughter said that they "were shocked and destroyed" about his death.
"We are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him painfully," continued the speaker.
Our thoughts and condolences are in this difficult time with Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank was first living in hostels, but that, "the things for him finally went uphill."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia KGO told.
Louis Galicia said that he could not imagine anyone wanting to hurt his younger brother.
He was a kind person with a big heart.
His way of connecting with his family was to always cook us something, prepare us dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of conflict.
He was the brother who swam with the electricity.
"With everything that's going on in the world, he was this uncut diamond that brightened every day," he said.
Anyone who has information about the case is asked to call the SFPD's call number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always stuck in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood Star has made this clear in an interview.
"I'll always be stuck in drawers or get stuck from outside label, which usually have little to do with me and reality."
"I myself do not wish to be perfect and successful."
"Truly, these things are rather clever to me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered "Miss Perfect", as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
In fact, the actress prefers to spend her time at home, as a TV set with loose dutt and Mexican food, says the magazine.
The White Glut raises the question about the children's wish: "We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect," says the Hollywood Star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is not a children's game" Aniston can be seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film will run with us from August 25th.
Golfer Langer receives the sport pyramid
His experiences on the horse are manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues were looking for a change with a ride on the beach.
For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.
CHIO: "Goldene Sport Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday evening, they hunted home for the food troughs in the fast gallop.
One kilometer at this pace, I was afraid.
"It wasn't a good experience," says Langer.
And then the riding career ended again.
On Saturday Germany's best golfer of all time was - 101 tournament victories - back in the vicinity of horses.
He and his family were guided by the ALRV plant, not even for photo purposes on a horse.
Langer was the first time in Aachen and with it also at the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sport aid provided the golden pyramid to the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala.
Awards are not lacking for the sympathetic athlete.
Bundesreinstreuz, Silbernes Lorberblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British queen raised him.
Langer is the 18th prizewinner of the sports pyramid.
On Saturday in Aachen, he met Hans Günter Winkler.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it will not only be awarded for sporting achievements, but also for social engagement."
For decades Langer has been promoting the young.
And so he also passed on the prize money of 25,000 euros.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US master champion was recorded in the "Hall of Fame des deutschen Sports" on Saturday.
Among the outstanding are the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the Fechter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-driver Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumous handballer Erhard Wunderlich.
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious society moved to the jumping stadium, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept his distance from the big animals.
Clinton and Trump's economic policy compared: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the trade agreement TTP - that is what Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two US Presidential candidates disagree on fiscal and energy policy as well as on a fundamental issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The one about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He himself would be quite different, says Trump.
He will reduce regulation massively, making himself strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says: The state has certain tasks to fulfil, it has disadvantaged opportunities to open up and needs money to do so.
That is why taxes for the rich would be increased, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton say almost literally.
The democratic candidate has even announced the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.
State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical tea party wing of Republicans.
So Trump could still have internal discussions.
The differences in energy and climate policy are more evident.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power stations and raise coal production in the USA.
Oil promotion should also be possible in areas that have been protected so far, and the Paris Climate Change Agreement will be terminated.
Clinton, on the other hand, wants to expand the renewable energies with its investment programme explicitly and demands: "A country will be the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs."
"It will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be us."
But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.
TPP, the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement, does not want both to sign.
At the same time, however, both of them do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs better.
They're supposed to be paid better, like Clinton.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.
She wants to raise him to 15 dollars an hour.
What Trump wants to do in this matter is not quite clear: Once he says the minimum wage must be raised, he says he should not be changed.
However, the major discussion of the coming months is likely to develop around the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens in order to stimulate growth.
His critics insist that this would only make the budget deficit even bigger.
On the other hand, Clinton, who wants to demand at least from the rich that they pay more taxes, says their critics: more taxes are not the solution either.
Escape: "Every fledgling woman has experiences of sexual violence"
Sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone, almost to everyday life.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers shelter.
In a large kitchen there are four women.
Everyone has a baby at least one year old.
One of them put her little son in her arms.
He looks curiously into the room with big eyes.
His mother stares at the tabletop.
Until she realizes she's being watched.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.
The scene is normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the district manager of Condrobs, a social assistance provider in Bavaria, and deals with the issue of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodations for women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich women's aid.
She was recently officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
Men do not exist - neither do they as visitors.
The exception is a guard at the front door.
"It is not exaggerated to say that every woman who arrives here has experienced sexual violence on her escape," says Bahr.
"Men flee because of wars because they are politically persecuted because they are threatened with torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as a hope bearer," she says.
In women, other reasons for escape prevailed: "Many secretly steal from it because they see no other way out".
In their home country, they have experienced sexual violence, coercion, genocide, slavery, or forced prostitution.
That's what keeps her going.
This continues on the run.
"For example, the fact that a bottle of water requires sexual action is not rare," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Who believes that as soon as they arrive in Germany, they end up wrong, Bahr tells.
Here, too, single women in refugee accommodation would often be viewed as inferior and, most severely, abused.
This leads to the traumatisation of about 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich, she estimates.
"Some of the children are probably not born voluntarily".
Many women are so used to saying nothing.
"Or they do not trust to talk openly about the experienced because the shame is too great".
Since they often do not know how to help themselves, Bahr demands more accommodation for them.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
To the question of whether they knew of a similar project as in Munich in their area of competence, some respond with no.
There is no such thing in government accommodation in the upper pavilions and upper francs.
Even in Schwaben only fled women are not isolated," says Karl-Heinz Meyer, government press spokesperson.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia there are floorwork or private homes in some community accommodation only for single women and their children.
The exception is Niederbayern, where there are two central accommodation for women only.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men.
A study published for the Committee states: "It is very important for men and women to be accommodated separately."
"If the private sphere fails or men and women are accommodated together, violence against women can come - continually -."
In particular, the washrooms should be separate and easily accessible to women, see the study.
How much the women feel about this need for protection can be read at the rush there is on the house in Munich.
"Since we have been talking about it, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Assisted workers strike: calls for new work-related measures
Deputys of the assistants have called on their union to approve new labour-fighting measures in their disputes regarding a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called on its entire Council to approve more work-fighting measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC stated that ministers had failed to address the concerns about the Treaty.
Assistant doctors and medical students voted in July on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members who were published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government had remained "persistently quiet" to problems, which led to the rejection of the treaty.
She said: "In view of this, the JDC Executive Board has voted to reject the proposed new contract completely and to request official renegotiations on all your concerns."
Today, in response to the government’s silence, the JDC Executive Board has made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating labour action beginning in early September.
The disputes led assistants to strike six times this year, the first total failure in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA Assistant Doctor Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed terms and conditions recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings, which were held before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students, that the contract should be advantageous and accepted.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors would be introduced in England.
Russia and Turkey: A "Ally of Outsiders"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to announce an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Putin's smiles seemed slimy and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restraining circumstances.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "love friend" Putin - according to a report quite five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
His enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite.
But one of Putin's most radiant, sustainable cooling showed that Russia's head of state had not forgotten anything.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduction words: the firing of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey.
Moscow's reaction at the time was wrangling.
Putin gave up and accused Ankara of falling into Russia's back.
The offense was even greater, as it was committed by a supposed friend.
Rebuilding the vesture will be difficult if not even impossible.
The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.
Most serious were the accusations made by senior officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from the illegal oil trade in Syria's territories controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He has fought this vehemently.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia was able to win some sort of victory.
For Ankara the advantages of a ceasefire are clearly obvious.
Erdogan needs first of all all all the friends he can get after he has been kidnapped in a failed coup almost his office last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.
They count on a late-season storm on the Mediterranean.
This week the state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti put it this way: "Tourists there long, tomatoes long here."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry on the West because it regards its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak answer.
In addition, the continuing resentment over the snail pace of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is keen to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian head of state certainly won a bonus in Ankara to demand support for the elected state agencies after the attempted coup.
This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of change of regimes.
The summit in this glamorous palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present, as I once described, an analyst, "Alliance of outsiders": two countries that are in breach of the West and feel ill treated and now allied.
Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they had not even addressed the issue.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about her differences, while Putin decided to emphasise them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a complete disaster when the NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
According to the CEO of the Bank, the RBS brand is only to be reduced to a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan informed BBC Scotland that RBS's brand was connected to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has been distanced since when it almost had to be collapsed and rescued eight years ago.
During this time, brand strategists used "RBS" to protect other end-consumer financial brands.
She supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now it has decided to focus more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the stock market listing will switch to NatWest.
The brand Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for the retail business that will gain more importance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a visit by customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The brand RSB will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed as we become more a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I am now saying that we are not pursuing global goals but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the perceptibility of the different brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It is time for us to develop into the Bank of the Brands, because how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers inside (we have asked)?" said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think, you will see many changes.
We can relaunch these brands, so I think time has come.
Frankie Dettori wins his 3,000th prize at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket, which brings him 3,000th prize
Jockey Frankie Dettori won his 3,000th British prize at Newmarket on Friday.
He put on predilection, which is trained by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who won before on Ghayyar, said, "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too
I'm very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very modest.
Dettori picks up the jubilee when he takes victory on Predilection
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 wins in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby winner had 4,493 career victories
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modernism and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that only a few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have been a fan of this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he had already made 6,000 winnings if he were not just a weekend and big tournament jockey!
Frankie's been in GB for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but besides, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the focal point of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nervous.
A whole series of big tournament winnings, including his famous "Glorious Seven" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, he was in trouble when he returned from his six-month barrier, but he showed an impressively characteristic strength to defie his twins and return to his best form.
And he's not at the end for a long time - Dettori once said that he wants to keep up with competitions until his 50th year.
Russia's Putin fired Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his Chief Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of the closest circle of confidence in Putin for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
In a statement by the Kremlin it is that Putin "has ordered Ivanov's release from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Bureau without giving any reason".
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, was appointed as his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin website (in Russian) it says that he was later Head of Protocol and Chief of Staff of the Government Staff.
He said to Putin about his appointment, "Thank you for your trust."
I think it is the government's most important task to support your work as head of state on draft legislation and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Do the smiling faces convince?
This step has made Moscow a mystery.
Sergei Ivanov was one of the closest associates of Vladimir Putin for a long time and works as he does for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigns at his own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, few are convinced here - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So this is the result of some kind of power struggle?
Nobody knows that right now.
But the official assertion - that a man once praised as a potential president wants to guide Russian environmental policy at once - was a major scepticism.
In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said "it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to entrust me with this very complicated post - you could almost say - difficult posts for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairing the Russian Bureau for four years and eight months.
Ivanov entered the post in December 2011.
Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once assumed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term of office would have violated the Constitution.
But this post was taken by another close ally Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after he hit the producer
Gibson was involved in a physical struggle last month in the set of the series in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, who produce the series, announced their termination in a joint opinion.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized publicly on Thursday before announcing his announcement.
On the set, there were artistic differences and disagreements.
I regret the incident," he said in a communication.
Details of how the character of Gibsons from the series that follows a team of FBI agents are published are expected to be published at a later date, according to the opinion of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously played in the Sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been on the show since the first season of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have been in my heart's blood for the past 12 years," said Gibson in a release on Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that will not be possible now.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and above all the best fans you can wish for a series.
The planned broadcast of the twelfth season is scheduled for 28 September.
Puzzles about fish that landed in the garden in Banff
A resident of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks it could be about the 75 fish that were pulled out of a fountain.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, on Periscope published a video of the spectacle hoping that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the northern deck of the Queensferry Crossings to the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "deck blower" that approach the completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The five bridge section is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 oblique ropes.
The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossings.
We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic measure in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fitment.
In total, almost 79% of the entire bridge decks are in place, and the last section of the deck today in Rosyth gets a concrete noise for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be raised on the bridge at its place.
Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first lock is a significant milestone in every bridge project.
With this fantastic project, the closure represents future-oriented construction and civil engineering.
After the installation of the last section of the road deck and its connection with the north tower deck in the extension, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north or country side.
This was reached by pulling the northern delivery bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Solid, as the Viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at an increase of about 3%.
Heikel, since the tolerances the team is working on were tiny - they were only a few millimeters on each side.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men have "Gluck to be alive"
Three men have "good luck to be alive" after being thrown from their fishing boat before Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station struck on Friday at 13:20 BST alarm after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulties in swimming safely while their boat moved on from its own strength.
"We saw how the boat turned around in its vicinity and imagined the worst," said Moelfre Vince Jones, head of the rescue station.
"Happyly, the strong winds have weaved the boat beyond its reach until we let it to water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging on a buoy without a life jacket.
They all came on board the coastal lifeboat and were taken back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said, "The three men who were thrown into the water have no luck and are still alive.
Although the boat engine had an emergency stop line, it was released by the person who controlled the boat when the boat was in the base of the boat.
Someone was watching over these men today.
Severely injured - man raises his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured.
As the police reported yesterday, the 50-year-old had got the key to the apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholic perpetrators cut the clothes of his ex-girlfriend.
When she got to the apartment, he stabbed her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured by the hand and the body.
The police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
He then alerted his sister.
Together with her partner, the 45-year-old wanted to calm her brother.
But she couldn't move him to leave the apartment.
That's why she left the house with her partner.
They met the man's ex-husband on the street.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds Braunschweigs cheap apartments?
The SPD and Greens believe that investors will be much more required in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1,300 apartments in the next few years?
At the next Council meeting, the SPD proposes a "action plan for living".
But dispute is programmed.
First of all, the question is: who should actually build cheap apartments?
A regulation has so far been lacking.
Chairman of the SPD, Christoph Bratmann, says: "We agree with the Greens: If you want to build on urban areas, 20 percent of all homes will have to be social housing."
However, the cheap apartments can also be built on stock.
However, the big issue in the town hall is, says Bratmann: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 per cent on such areas, but as much as 20 per cent of apartments as possible as social housing."
A new urban housing funding programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, will provide incentives.
The problem, says Bratmann: "There is currently no agreement between the political groups."
The CDU wants to make investors as few regulations as possible.
The left wants even tougher demands for investors.
Despite this, says Bratmann, the situation on the housing market is exacerbated.
If the concept of action is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the construction management.
More staff is needed.
It's unclear if we'll get the professionals.
However, the program is not entirely complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments that should be built anyway.
How, though, does one compare the loss of another 1,300 cheap apartments, whose promotion will end in the next few years?
There will be 500 apartments by 2020 alone.
In order to prevent this, according to Nicole Palm, the planning spokesman, we should now buy out outgoing bonds from the city.
It would also have to be thought about getting apartments back into the price fixing.
That's possible in the West Town.
At one time the problem was solved.
In the West, deadlines are set at the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price fixing for cheap apartments.
Only: the owners do not want the housing companies.
The number of social housing in the western city is again dramatically increased, removing itself from the aim of so-called mixing.
There should be no more concentration of social weaknesses in just a few parts of the city.
The Greens expect there to be still movement in the discussion.
Holger Herlitschke, President-in-Office of the Party, says: "For a wide majority, the CDU must enter the boat."
They have concentrated on more construction sites for single-family houses.
What does not mean, however, that a compromise cannot be found.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worthwhile
It is fascinating to see how the world changes.
The fact that teenagers and children don't go outside anymore, but rather prefer to spend their spare time staring at screens has been lamented by many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the sofa and getting them active.
The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and last but not least to smartphones.
Therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude one another.
I refer, of course, to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters first created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs were created).
How many phenomena of pop culture did the interest drop before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
The market launch in other countries has been shifted by the massive demand that overburdened the servers.
Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémons, who are being tracked with a GPS and, once they have been found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured".
One generation who played the game when she was younger joined the madman and jumped for the search from the sofa.
In the U.S., the game led to a significant increase in steps that the "average" person makes every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch tracking 35,000 users, recently told Washington Post that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of followed people who train 30 minutes every day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data for performance enhancement.
Many public health awareness campaigns that want to bring people to "take 30 minutes' time," "come from the sofa" and "be active every day" are coming across deaf ears because many public health messages are boring and come from people who look miserable.
However, the importance of sport cannot be over-estimated.
Those who regularly exercise reduce their chances of suffering from cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps to control weight, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to be listed here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something outdoors that is fun for them.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even make new friendships on the hunt.
As always, there are Moorish perpetrators who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could walk against a door.
What's up?
There's been a breakthrough.
Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game.
The new will lose its charm and use will decline over time.
However, due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with becoming active in the real world, helping many people hunting to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles creates gold in damenturnen
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamic on the jumper.
It's easy on the bar.
Breathtaking on the ground.
Brilliant on the whole line.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
On Thursday, the 19-year-old American gymnast climbed into the multi-combat title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.
Their total result of 62,198 was clearly before the silver medal winner and the final five teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliy Mustafina.
The Americans Simone Biles sings on the hovering beam during the women's single more competition in the artistic tournaments at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-combat title and a total of the fifth, as she strengthens her reputation to be the best of their generation or even even theirs.
She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey in that moment ended.
This success puts her in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:
For the past three years, Billes has dominated her sport, winning 15 World Champion medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Reton said about her that she is "the best tournament I've ever seen."
She expected a final exam in Brazil, a competition that did not go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.
Not with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be regarded as disappointment.
The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace themselves after they each won gold and silver in the single mercenary finals of women at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles got the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as an exclamator at the farewell celebration of the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted, during their long journey to the top, never to have planned the future, this is not really true.
Part of their ground exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympia Arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gym, in which Boorman trained, became powerful.
Since the summer of 2013, she has lost no more competition, a victory series that will last as long as it wants.
Even if Mustafina was led by two turns, the image was slippery.
Swivel beams and ground tournaments - in which movies hold the world title - lurked.
With 15,433 she brought back on the hoverbar - and put one on the ground with a 15,933.
Raisman hugged her gently as she expected her end - a pure formality - and tears streamed on images glowing red, white and blue eyeliners when the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.
The performance of Raisman was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a Tiebrake.
This time the 22-year-old team captain, called "Oma" by the Americans, had a head start.
After her ground practice, she threw kiss hands at the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes appeared doubtful.
As far as Biles is concerned, the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in serial killers shot in the car listening to music
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot, killed in one of the most deadly attacks in Phoenix's first serial murder for a decade, while they were in the car and listened to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot on June 12 while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, is to be read in the report.
The police reported that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a robbery, since the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that were owned by one of the adult victims.
The police spokesperson of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investigators to become a closer look at whether it is connected with four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed in nine attacks, mainly in Hispanic residential areas within four months and two more were injured.
"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," said Howard of KHPO, a CBS subsidiary, at the beginning of the month.
It is assumed that the suspect used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Elli's daughter Maleah still died on site.
A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and hear music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which was aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and is expected to be the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine room.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It gets better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like the least of his old friends, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can't do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't get used to it.
What's not right at all -- of course, one's got into it," she said.
Her husband Vincent and her were told that Edmund may never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far that they suggested institutionalizing him.
"My first answer was 'I didn't know that people are still doing'," said Picciuto.
Edmund can run with the help of a walking aid.
Edmund was unable to sit or scratch until his third year of life and still cannot speak.
But he's making progress slowly.
He can run with support and ride a bicycle.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund designed for "Please sing something to me"."
"We teach him sign language," said Picciuto CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some signs alone.
Microcephaly has a wide variety of causes: genetics such as Edmund and infections with viruses such as measles or the Zikavirus during pregnancy.
The symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly.
It's too early to say how it's going to affect the life that's infected with the Zikavirus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I kept asking, what's going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't asked for the forecast for a long time, because I don't expect anyone to tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
It's getting better.
You know it's gonna be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rainfalls, floods give rise to rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and large floods in Louisiana forced the governor to call out the emergency on Friday. It is expected to have more rainfalls all Saturday.
Numerous rivers in the south of Louisiana and south of the Mississippi flooded their banks and threatened with large floods after extreme rainfalls, reported the National Weather Service.
The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards announced that the government officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and that assistance to the communities concerned is already on the move.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the Governor, said that the requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags increased.
Steele said that only the municipality of Tangipahoa had requested ten thousand sandbags.
A flood warning system is used over far parts in the south of Louisianas until Saturday.
The weather service reported that there could be an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain in this area.
In the south of Alabama, a flood warning system was used on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The river Comite near Baton Rouges and the river Amite near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, will most likely reach record levels over the weekend.
Meteologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers can flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish poses a danger, as these will flow only slowly over the run-up rivers into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level on Friday at 9.00 a.m., which was ever recorded.
Rescue teams were still attracting people from the floodwaters in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and son-in-law, were among those rescued on Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house, rose sharply overnight.
He said that another stepson who lives nearby warned him.
"We woke up and the water was pouring and pouring in," said Hansford.
It reached my waist.
His wife said that she had never seen such a rise in the river in the 48 years she lived there.
Hansford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that emergency workers had all three rescued in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were housed until Friday.
Krautmann said that the flood had spread "quickly" as there were still heavy rains and that the authorities had to consider evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer reported from midnight to Friday morning from 13,75 inches of rain near Livingstone.
Krautmann said that the soil has been covered by the rains since Wednesday.
The authorities indicated that heavy rains and road flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and teaching failure in five school districts.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that an associate in Tangipahoa listed 200 flooded houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, both of which were now flooded.
The head of the community of Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets washed from the flood.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency accommodation was set up to accommodate the evacuated.
"As soon as the water starts to return, they will be able to return to their homes," he said.
In Hammond town of the municipality of Tangipahoa almost two dozen streets were closed due to the flood and sandbags provided for the residents to take along who hope to keep the water from their homes and shops.
"The last great flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said it was still raining on the Gulf Coast.
According to his records, a handful of houses were reported to be flooded on Thursday, but no reports have been made on Friday.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "cut by bullets", survived shooting in Philadelphia
The police announce that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, this week already the second time a 6-year-old child is shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
The grandparents said that Brown suffered several gunshot injuries, including in the loins, legs, arms and abdomen, but that he was aware of his transport to the hospital.
"He's been through a lot, his little body was pierced by bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the transmitter.
I just can't believe this.
The boy's condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy's family told the station that he would probably recover.
He should have started the first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was shot on the front seat of a car together with the 29-year-old who is in a critical condition, reports the sender.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police were just investigating whether one of the injured men could be among the perpetrators.
Investigators informed CBS Philadelphia that there appeared to have been a crossfire between several shooters.
Patron sleeves for storm rifles, which were traced back to various storm rifles, overlooked the scene.
It seems that this was clearly a continuing struggle.
On the street, on both sides of the walkway, there were sleeves.
Thus there seems to have been several armed fighters here who were very actively involved," said police officer Anthony Ginaldi of the police in Philadelphia to the station.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
There were no arrests and the police are currently reviewing reports of the surveillance video.
On Tuesday another six-year-old girl was hit by a crossbreeder on her arm when she was playing in front of her house in the residential area of the West Oak Lane.
She recovers and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why We Need Simone, Gabby, and Laurie
That's what I introduce myself to under the women's Olympic team in the tournaments for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been in every summer Olympics since 1984 and the United States has never been so dominant.
And second, this team has three tournaments, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which inspired many young girls of other skin color.
The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, is Jewish, and round off Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has fortified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one female was an African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
That shows strength.
During the last Olympics Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected but masterful gymnastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth heterosexual American who won an individual multi-combat event for women gold.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We experience the tip of this sport, but that's not how tournament classes look all over the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same route as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.
They are the "last five" because the next Olympic team will only have four tournaments in the team. Moreover, this is last year with Marta Karolyi as a coach.
But the reality is that tournaments are an expensive sport and tournaments come primarily in private tournaments, which are maintained by parents for the training, furnishings, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for coaches and their tournaments and families).
The majority of these tournaments are in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs the tournaments get their entire training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started the tournament.
We must enable the communities of countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie to have a more tangible and accessible gymnastics.
I founded my 20-year-old gymnast.
At my events we have offered free and affordable tournaments in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer young people high-quality tournaments that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Turning develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for the school and professional success.
It's the inspiration of this team that makes thousands of young girls interested in tournaments and that's great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real depiction of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic team gold and thank you, have motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to begin their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistants want to organize more strikes after they have rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed treaty with the British Medical Association's officials, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistants who voted against the election rejected him.
In July Hunt had revealed plans to enter the contract by necessity and said that the NHS was located in a "Nowhere" and any further delay would be detrimental to the employees and patients.
The first assistant doctors are expected to have a new contract, which includes changes to night work and weekend work to improve care at weekly times.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Committee for Assistant Physicians, said last night in a communication: "Assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed treaty, in particular that it will raise the current workforce crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly."
Only eight weeks remain until the first group of doctors falls under the new treaty, progress has to be made and time is running out.
The BMA's efforts to resolve disputes through discussions were in opposition to the government and sometimes to deafening silence.
This was the one promise Jeremy Hunt had made only last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the pressure and address the concerns of the assistants."
If he does not do so, it has made it clear to the assistants that they are ready to carry out further work struggles.
The last strike at the end of April saw a postponement of almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, involving nurses and specialists to provide cover for doctors on the strike post chain.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adopting the Reformed Treaty with the British Medical Association's officials.
The BMA wants a better weekly pay for the 54,000 assistants who are subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director General of the NHS Staff, called on the assistant doctors to end the strike.
Mortimer said: "Work struggles do not achieve any of the few, but burden already overburdened teams and service providers and only provide care, distress and interruption to patients, nurses and their families."
In the last two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Assistant Physicians and we have responded positively to the concerns of the Ministry of Health and other ministries regarding the protection and whistleblowering.
Employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a career break, training skills, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and gender pay gap in medicine - was a sign of how serious it was for employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health to comply with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2 per day medication that can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2 per day drug after recommended by the authorities to give this more people for a longer period of time.
The anti-emetic drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The medicine has been given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NHS Regulatory Authority has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS Regulatory Authority has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Some 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty materials in the artery walls that form deposits.
If the coating breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that clots the blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
When the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and clot the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.
The guide draft of NICE, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack, another heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences."
The fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person.
Experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Through a preliminary recommendation by Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - particularly the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years.
Culture of Political Correctness makes electoral fraud flourish in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year on the occasion of a government report on corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities being deliberately ignored as a devastating government report revealed today.
The former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and councillors to ignore evidence of election abuse due to "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion".
The former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said that intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that it should be permitted for the police to set up locks outside of polling booths in order to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters carry an ID card with them to prove their identity in elections.
At present, a voter only has to name and address his name.
The report proposes to put non-removable ink on a person's finger when they give their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Whistleblower should get more protection, says Sir Eric.
It calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions by non-official committees or working groups.
"This not only serves against electoral fraud, but is also intended to protect the municipal government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet election scandal in East London.
Last year, a special electoral court decided that after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices, Mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from his office.
The court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he had silenced his critics with racist and Islamic accusations.
Rahman is said to "have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to elect him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or followed by imitation, in which a person chooses as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He was particularly alarming about the fraudulent choice of letters - with the elderly members of the Muslim community having put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clear the electoral system, including the conduct of identification to prove identity
His report states: "As evidence has been provided that pressure has been exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, in particular women and young people, in order to vote in accordance with the will of the elderly, in particular communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
"There were concerns that... state institutions had deliberately ignored such behaviour due to "politically correct" hypersensitivity to the ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the ban on political activists working on correspondence documents to stop "harvests".
The report, which is considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher registration reviews in order to prevent the electoral list from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID card.
Use non-removable ink on a person's finger as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.
carry out systematic checks on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible for election.
A three-year limitation on requests for an automatic choice of letters.
Prohibition for political activists to process complete letter elections and envelopes of letters elections.
The police are giving the power to lock-outs to polling stations.
An amendment of the law which facilitates an accusation of intimidation in accordance with the representation of the People Act 1983.
Photographer ban in election stations.
Claim that only English may be used in the electoral stations (except Wales).
Intensification of training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go to the polling booth alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "unbelievable" that no criminal charges were filed after Tower Hamlet's case.
"The Electoral Court has declared Lutfur Rahman and its deputy to be unfit for corrupt and illegal practices due to a litany," he said.
He was guilty of sufficient - in accordance with the high requirements of criminal proceedings - due to a number of reasons.
He also criticises the ineffective "abstinence controls" of the electoral registration departments of the council houses.
Sir Eric said, "The court judgment in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of parliaments, bears a proud heritage, but the worrying and hidden spread of electoral fraud and denial by some authorities threatens this good reputation.
Crazy after Kate's Radler doppelganger and other famous double riders of Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympiad in Rio have this week come across French cycling athlete Pauline Ferrand-Prevot except for Rand and Band, who has proved to be an impressive double runner of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic woman is by far not the only athlete fighting for gold who has his own famous double ganger - at least not if you are allowed to believe in social media.
In honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that flash on our screens at the time, FEMIIL has created a list of Olympics that have more than a certain resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
The hunter and the wolf: team member of the US team in archery Brady Ellison, left, has been compared since childhood with Leonardo DiCaprio
In addition to Kate's double rider on the cycling track, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain archer might be the twin of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio.
The U.S. team member in archery, Brady Ellison, has caused a storm on Twitter after the pictures he sees appear to be very similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star.
In fact, the archer got the madness in the social media and admitted that he has been hearing since his childhood that he looks like Leo.
"I see no great resemblance to myself, except for the facial hair," said Brady of the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess I'll take this as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly become even more central this year: the striking resemblance between the British widespring Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her large, expressive eyes should be able to go through as a double runner for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared for years with the Glee Star Matthew Morrison.
A gear higher: This user believes that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception actor
Another constant comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver medallion girl Yulia Efimova shows more than just the sun-tanned skin and blonde hair like the actress Annalynnne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian was attested by fans, like an "athletical version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong women: football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the similarities too
Theory put in space: According to this user there might be a reason for the similarity of the couple
A Twitter user expressed their satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, the American football star Hope Solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney as well as the gold medal winner in the Gabby Douglas tournament, which has its own beautiful, broad smile, similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympics apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmer "has died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at 4x200m freestyle swimstoffs attracted viewers of the CBC live transfer of the Olympic Games on Wednesday
The Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologize after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "began like Mief" and during the race like "a pig died".
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle swimstrip.
MacDonald, who had been taken to CBS' commentator team on board to give more "color", could be heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese woman has lost the connection, baby".
Too excited, gone like Mief, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the 1:57,79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing Canadians to unlock the gap to China.
Audiences all over Canada responded quickly online after they were shocked by the tone and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "has died like a pig"???
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the air."
Ai Yanhan from China was described at the final 4 x 200m freestyle swimming pool for women as follows: "This little 14-year-old Chinese woman has lost the connection, baby."
The critique against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came fast and hard, with many of them speaking to him.
Twitter user did not hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and you make us all look like racists.
A short time later, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC broadcast, apologized live for MacDonald's comment and said, "We apologize that the comment on a swimming performance was broadcast."
It was an unfortunately chosen formulation, we're sorry it happened."
CBC apologized at the end over 90 times to the people who responded to the comment on Twitter
Commentary colleague Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added its apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also quickly apologized and issued a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that it was possible for them to be broadcast.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on mission and our followers in the social media last night.
To clarify one, Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.
However, they were inappropriate and an unfortunately chosen formulation. Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon MacDonald apologized in the broadcast and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swim party in the CBC Olympic show," he said.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."
Of course, no disregard was intended and I am very sorry."
Buyers in Primark indignant about women who try shameless underwear in the middle of the shop
The buyers didn't know where to look when a woman took off her clothes in the middle of a primark to try underpants.
To make the situation worse, she patterned what she looked like in it, pulled it out and put it back into the shelf.
She continued browsing and tried four pairs of underpants in a shop at Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone.
The Primark Shop at Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone, where the woman tried the underpants before putting them back into the shelf
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "she got dressed again and left the business without buying anything."
She said, "People could not believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underpants out of the layout, pulled out her own pantyhose and pants and tried them on.
"She didn't even try to find a slightly more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, freaking like Oskar."
"Everybody stared when they pulled out the underwear that obviously didn't like her, as she put her back into the shelf."
She repeated the same thing with three other underpants before she finally decided that she liked nothing, attracted herself again and went out.
"She didn't seem to bother that she was watching anyone - or thinking about the person who might buy the underwear she had tried."
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "How disgusting to think that someone would take underpants home with someone who had another person and was not washed."
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "As I have obtained, the employees have tried to remove the clothes from the sale after they left - which is just as good."
"I would hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman was wearing them and pulling them out again and was not washed."
A speaker from Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday, 9 August in our branch in Folkstone."
All products in question have been withdrawn from the sale.
How to Protect Yourself From Gun Attacks With Krav Maga
The outside world is a dangerous place, but this Dailymail.com video could make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Regardless of whether you are approaching you from the front or the back, this video will show you how to turn the spear for your robber.
If you are approaching you from behind, you should first turn around so that you can see your attacker and "get out of the shot line," says Mizrachi.
Then grab the gun between your forearm and your shoulder before you hit it with your free elbow in the face.
Then hit him with the knee and twist him while the attacker bends down for pain, the weapon out of his hands. Hit him with the run into his face and move backward while they are pointing the gun at him.
In the case of attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line, grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot.
At the same time shift the weight on the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then turn the weapon out of his handle before they move backwards and the weapon is directed towards him.
Does it sound difficult?
Look at the video to see exactly how Mizrachi is doing.
But remember, it's safest to hand over your money if you're not a Krav Maga Grandmaster.
Traveler Ian Wright scales his tongue for a guide to the dirtiest places in Europe
A British traveler subjected his immune system and strangler flex to a serious test by rejecting some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
The moderator and traveler Ian Wright, 51 from Suffolk, pushed his steps on a Euro sign, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a sink button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he will get into.
But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickbiker's Guide to Inner Strength", brought some surprising results.
The idea of licking the sink button of a train toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be totally repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and about his own health.
Luckily, nothing left behind what he dismissed, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr Wright became known for testing the resilience of his intestine by traveling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public countries at railway stations to sinks from toilets, the task was definitely to test his immune system
In the film he said, "As a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud."
In the film, he definitely met his call.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sampling showed a number of luminometers of more than 4,000 units.
In comparison, the luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to leak after its luminometer number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands had one of less than 60
Mr Wright and the Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in various places such as the bathroom
In the film, he says, "This comes close to the worst I've smelled in a toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not gonna mess around here because it's disgusting in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company equips Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamins C and D to support the development of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something fascinating to look at and at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics.
We ran crazy brainstormings that ended up saying, "Let's call us Ian."
They claim that the interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary film we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think that the movie shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who led the film's director, added: "Let me say it this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I told him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the movie."
Of course, there were things that made it easier to make Ian lick them and others where this was quite difficult.
I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film."
In a 2015 Valio survey, 84 per cent of all lactic acid bacteria surveyed, particularly with the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 per cent, said that they at least occasionally use products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
As Social Family Destroyed Before Delogation Social Apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
An asocial family left their social home after a denunciation with a damage of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.
After they were violently removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing association found the property in an irreparable condition.
The walls showed clumsy holes, wooden sections were torn up, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated on the walls.
The family was relocated and it is assumed that they now live in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the house management at Cornwall Housing, said that she fears that the apartment is no longer to repair.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here, and I think people don't have to live this way.
There are many things to consider, as this property is probably considered as not so beautiful part of Cornwalls.
The family is notorious and its reputation is so.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that had brought the family involved street fights with baseball fighters, intimidators of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, fights and curses.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease agreement, was given an arrangement for antisocial behavior in June.
In some rooms of the house that may be demolished, old garbage was found
In the estate where drugs have been dealt in the past, wood pieces have been torn up
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and had to be called the police regularly
Cornwall Housing took her and her partner to the estate for violently this week, after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.
The denunciation was cheered by relieved neighbors who said that their lives were made a hell.
One of them said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
"Today we couldn't sleep."
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it'll be beautiful.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighborhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have been a failure to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house to which the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years
On the overgrown side of the municipal house, garbage and old toys were dropped
He added: "It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for her behavior and that of her family, since a delogation is always the last step to consider the Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team, the police from Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who courageously went to us and gave us the information.
I hope that this development will bring consolation to some neighbours and the message that antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedroom rooms of the house after the denunciation
Workers of the house administration will now have to get rid of garbage mines that surround the house
In 2014, the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash worth £1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after she had been guilty of possession of a class B drug for commercial purposes.
She claimed that the money was for a gravestone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After they were without shelter, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the walls of the house were covered with graffiti.
The police say they're going to debrief tenants who don't comply with the house rules.
Angela Crow from the Devon and Cornwall police informed that the debriefing was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not comply with the house rules.
"This goes to those who think that they can behave without self-deceptions as well as those who have been harmed by such behavior," she said.
Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behavior, which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panic after flying a deep-flying military jet over the beach
Sun worshipers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion Air Force aircraft made an incredible crash
The air forces reported that it was on a training flight but insisted that no safety risk was present
This was the moment when frightened tourists start panicking after a deep-flying jet crashes over a full beach.
Dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew almost in close proximity over the sun’s baths on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers jumped as they could understandably begin to worry about the noise of the jet engines, without first seeing what was coming on them through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-by in the social media, said: "There was a really deep flight twice and there was a moment when it looked as if it were falling."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling down on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and incredibly deep flew
The Portuguese air forces today stated that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to identify them.
The speaker said that due to the poor visibility of the jet, land fires nearby flew a little deeper than usual, but the air forces insisted that safety was not at all at risk.
This summer, land fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland, killing four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air forces today indicated that the pilot had to fly so low due to the conditions - strong fog and fire smoke - which reduced his vision
The aircraft was on a training flight in which the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with worries about Seville
Seville - Barcelona FC fights for the first step on Sunday to win the first title in the new football season.
The Catalans take off in the duel around the Spanish Supercup towards the FC Sevilla, the replay rises three days later at Camp Nou.
The double winner must refrain from playing Neymar with the low Cupinalist and ruling European League champions, among others, who fights with Brazil against the Olympic Football Tournament.
Goalie also lacks Marc-Andre ter Stegen.
In training, the German has suffered a knee-dipping, which explains for the first time at least for Claudio Bravo's benefit.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing for number one status in Barcelona for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far failed to make a clear decision, leaving Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen in most other applications.
Before the first mandatory game of the new season, the Spanish master has doubts about the fitness status of the team, which was humiliated on Saturday in a 0:4 Liverpool test game.
Even in the 3:2 test race against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co. did not yet know how to convince.
Seville, in turn, has to disappear the 2:3-low position after extension in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and strives for the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona is the record winner with eleven achievements so far.
Ma Long in its own league at table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion.
The 27-year-old defeated his compatriot and "defender" Zhang Jike 4:0 in a one-sided final on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro.
The world rankings first got the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes at World Cup, World Cup, World Tour final tournament and Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese made it into the end game as expected and made the title between each other.
This made it clear that for the third time in a row, a Chinese would get the single title in the sign of the Five Rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympics was the former SVS-NÖ-Legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the record, between the sentences and at time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had retreated to the Tribunes and had their defenders in a fair competition alone.
"I've played the matches up here for my country."
"I'm playing for myself in the finals," Zhang said.
After the game, gold and silver medal winners posed with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpected one-sided.
Ma had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first sentence.
After that he set the pace on the record and left Zhang only 13 points in total.
Because of Ma's superiority, the expected moving match did not develop.
However, there were still enough breathtaking ball changes to be seen.
Mizutani won the bronze match against the 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonow 4:1.
In his quarter final against the German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, the Weißrusse had suffered a rib injury, was then treated as a doctor, had to "finally" have satisfied himself with sheet metal.
By the way, the Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had become the same high table tennis age Olympia.
Donald Trump clears huge problems in the campaign
The leadership of the U.S. Republicans is plagued by massive concerns, even in traditionally conservative states, to lose their majority.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses in his election campaign in the former Republican stronghold Utah.
A rare moment in which the normally grotesque and self-assured multimillionaire expressed such concerns as correspondents reported.
After he threw 16 rivals out of the race within his own Republican camp, the doubts about his success in the struggle for the White House are growing.
"We have huge problems in Utah," said Trump to evangelical Christians who asked for support in important states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
If false reports were about his candidacy, he took up his well-known media shield again.
Republican Hochburgen Wobblen
Utah is usually a secure bank for Republicans.
According to a survey conducted by SurveyUSA in June, Trump and his competitor from the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, were in the same position.
Other institutions, however, do not look forward to the distance that is usual for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered at risk.
In an interview by the channel CNBC, Trump answered the question as to how he wanted to stop Clinton's advance: "Genauso, as I have done so far".
And pushed after: This will be "either successful, or I will make a very nice, long holiday".
He's doing nothing but "telling the truth."
If it was not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness, it was all right, Trump continued to say.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the party should have threatened to cancel funds to support its election campaign, and should not be able to present better survey values.
Instead, the Republican candidates for the Congress want to be more impoverished.
Olympia: Three-tier fraud in doping testing
The IOC intends to set up a Disciplinary Commission on the case.
Kenya's athletes threaten the second doping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro Ungemach.
After an attempt at fraud at a doping check in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a trainer home.
The International Olympic Committee announced the immediate establishment of a Disciplinary Commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan operative had announced that the former Sprinter and today's Coach, John Anzrah, had given a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich.
This had been reported by the Doping Controllers to Kenya's team management.
The World Association IAAF has requested the IOC to provide information on the case in order to work on its own investigations, a IAAF spokesman announced.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures of the IAAF, the IAAF will carry out an assessment," said an IAAF statement.
"He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and spent himself as Ferguson Rotich, gave the sample and signed it," said Kenya's Head of Mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the Athlete's accreditation, which was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich had become more than 800 metres in 2015 in Beijing World Cup 4.
Four days earlier, the Kenyan Athletics Head of Delegation Michael Rotich had been withdrawn from the Rio games.
He is supposed to have informed athletes of upcoming doping tests against money payments from his country.
According to media reports, he was arrested on his return to Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special observation for a long time at the IOC after numerous doping events.
In the announcement of the IOC's more than 2000 doping target controls prior to the Rio games, it was unusual to point out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are being taken to the sights.
Prior to the summer games in Brazil, the World Anti-Doping Agency had put much pressure on the African country to create an anti-Doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before Olympia began.
As a result, WADA took Kenya from the list of countries whose doping control is in line with the rules of the WADA.
Kenya is considered a great nation of runners.
The country's athletes won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
A number of television reports by the ARD have repeatedly accused people of being easily accessible in Kenya Doping means and of having a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently requested a similar investigation in Kenya, as he had done in Russian athletics.
It has been demonstrated that this type of sport has been widely and systematically baptized.
Russia's athletes were then excluded from the summer games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In Shakespeare's year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple of lovers, similar to Romeo and Julia.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the classical temple and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of Mary.
In the orchestral grave, the Simón Bolívar Orchestra led by Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he whispers.
We always say she's very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody.
It is a wonderful mixture, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this production Bartoli plays an older Maria.
She remembers her love with pain with Tony while the younger Maria plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First because it is musically extraordinary!
And then there would be Mary's personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and funny and bright".
So she's smart, of course naïve, and very passionate.
"She is very similar to me, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman", Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It is such an honor to work with her for us.
She's a very generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You can see it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it's his life!
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a happy approach to life, that is very important at all!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly topical: "In this piece it is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New Yorkers didn't want them.
They are the same subjects, and they are as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later the piece is still relevant.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join the IS, reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that her family learned about her death a few weeks ago in Raqqa, Syria.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqa, the Bollwerk of the group in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died shortly after she had planned to leave the war - torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only good is in it - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision," said Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from East London entered a plane to Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says that Clinton will remain candidate for Supreme Court in the event of a election victory at Garland.
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader in Senate Mitch McConnell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the deceased judge to the Supreme Court of Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expected to select Garland "with a certain degree of certainty".
A spokeswoman from Reid later said that he had not yet spoken to Clinton if she would nominate Garland and he speculate.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team would not worry about a new candidate.
Garland is the U.S. Supreme Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia.
Raid said that Republicans blocked the Garland nomination, that they were Lakai and helpers of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump was unsuitable for the president's office.
Treats wants a nude calendar for "women and men"
The treats magazine works with photographer David Bellemere to produce a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Calendar for 2017.
The editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine was different from Oldschool Playboys because "Playboy is for men".
I'm doing this for women.
Apparently, he believes that the Calendar does too.
"We need to return to the portrayal of timeless and classic handicaps in which both women and men feel comfortable and who feel inspired by these images of a female body," said Shaw in a press release on the publication of the Calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can file their pictures online or personally at open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish municipality calculated with mass flight
"He who does not adapt and praises Erdogan sits on packed suitcases," says Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Gülen-near Foundation Dialogue and World.
In the short term, the Kurdish municipality of Germany expects tens of thousands of people seeking protection who flee from Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term, it could even be "a few hundred thousand", believes the president of the Federation Ali Toprak.
The Kurdish municipality of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany due to the hard action of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt.
"In the short term, I am counting on tens of thousands, in the medium term, with a few hundred thousand people seeking protection from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says Federal President Ali Toprak of the "World" of Friday.
Because the government had already covered Kurdish strongholds with criminal action months ago, 500,000 Kurds were fleeing within Turkey.
After the spoiled coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks would be added.
Many will want to start again in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey.
"It can't be that a state that takes up refugees itself produces refugees in its own country," said Toprak.
The head of the Association complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevitian cities.
So Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last great minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been exterminated or displaced in the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The head of the Association demanded that the federal government "position itself as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and his followers".
In Germany, too, a "Hexenhund" takes place against Erdogan critics.
I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will look for asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and oppositionals.
The branding as a Golden Trailer destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics.
"He who does not adapt and praises Erdogan sits on packed suitcases, by the way, also the chemists and seculars," said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Golden-Near Foundation for Dialogue and Education, the "World".
As the newspaper reports under appeal to the figures of the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks presented the largest group of the asylum-rights recognised for political persecution in Germany.
On the day of 30 June this would have been 11,386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all recognized as eligible for asylum (39,625).
In this survey, there are no refugees who fled before war, poverty, or perspectivelessness.
Asylum entitled under the Basic Law are exclusively political, i.e. by state, individual persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals get nothing from the summer election with - and the vacationers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, they understood.
In 2021 the Landtag elections will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because it's not going to go stupider than it's been until now: summer holidays, heat and land day elections - that's what's going on.
The locals who are supposed to be convinced by the electorate are on holiday.
Most holidaymakers who are in the country on the way on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not locals, so do not choose the land day.
There are also practical problems: during the holidays help hang up the posters, blow up the balloons, distribute the flyers, and at the end tell the voices to only run up effortlessly.
Until September 4, 2016, the election day and the last holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has once again had to pass election campaigns close to the people.
The hot phase, if you can say so at all, has just begun.
And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD/CDU coalition, has to fear for his office.
The SPD, since 1998, the strongest party, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.
Exciting is how strong Neuling AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 Head of Government, makes an almost unobtrusive election campaign, one looks at his large posters.
He travels through the land, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as his legendary vocabulary predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, Soulring got cold feet and blames Chancellor Merkel on the blossoming of the AfD.
Her refugee policy, her "We can do this" has accelerated the rise of the right populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful office now.
The CDU, with its leading candidate, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to make a campaign at the right place at the wrong time.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major debates; Merkel Bundestagswahlkreis is located in the northeast.
But the target group was not right, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliner and Saxony there than Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority from other federal states," complained Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But no one from other corners of Germany is hurting to listen to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the North-East CDU largely refrains from the usual competitions on the marketplaces and from shopping centers with parasols and balloons.
That, Kokert says, only plays a "subordinate role".
The Union has also noticed that in the country, it is based on the fact that it has to make a lot of effort to find a new thread for the people.
You are like the left, the SPD, the Greens: in the far corners of the country hardly present.
The advice of the CDU election fighter Kokert to his fellow fighters, however, is self-explanatory: "You must go where it hurts, namely where the people are: Village parties, Golden weddings, every birthday celebration must be used".
Because a lot is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign.
In surveys, the social democrats were last behind partner CDU (25) with 22 percent and only just before the AfD (19).
At the 2011 CDU election, the SPD had clearly won 35.6 percent (2.2) before the CDU.
The Green Party, with seven percent in the polls, is expected to make the leap into the land day.
They make a modern virtue out of the holiday note and spend most of their election campaign on the Internet.

Otherwise, green electoral fighters go looking for local voters among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the leading candidate, is just bent by a houseboat through the mecklenburgian lakes and also finds it beautiful.
Her impression: "Valid leave in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment".
B27 refurbishment: restaurants suffer from lockdown
At the speed with which the B 27 is refurbished, there is nothing to mercenary.
For those responsible for the construction work, which starts at 5.30 a.m. and ends only at about 20 a.m., there is all over praise.
"They've made everything pretty tedious," Elvira Tetzlaff says about the jet tank.
It's a superteam.
There's no delay either.
The construction site could be moved to the south on a scheduled basis at the beginning of the week, until the end of October.
It is also commended for the reception of those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the setting-up of aid flights.
Since the construction site has been migrated to the south on Monday and the closure of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has also been lifted and the connection to Rottenburg is restored, the traffic situation within the town has relaxed.
Citizens can now travel from oftherdingen from the B 27 on both sides.
Disappearance through the place seems to go back.
"There were some significant complaints," says Florian King, deputy head of the department responsible for the traffic management of the refurbishment.
The inhabitants of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many sleigh paths were looking for and more familiar to their navi than the signage.
This led to some trucks ripping in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were not respected, the municipality also urged the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There were considerable exceedances," says King, who once made himself known on the ground about the situation.
There have already been flashes of two to three per minute.
The fastest one was traveling at 77 km/h in the Tempo-30 zone.
Since the construction site moved on, but it has become calmer.
For the businessmen at the B 27 it is only a small comfort that customers from Rottenburg are now open again.
Businessmen don't like looking into the cards.
But that the B 27 refurbishment has led them to sales breaks, lets anyone you ask see through.
However, some are more and some are less affected.
Those who have less to do with the "end customer", i.e. produce for other companies, for which the refurbishment has hardly any consequences.
Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "highest slight decline" at the Maier car house, but he also admits that of course "the clientele is missing".
The locals along the road are the strongest packed.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, former Krone, finds clear words.
This is threatening to exist.
Not only him, but all the restaurants met it "hardly".
There were no customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.
We must be happy about every euro sales.
The loss of sales is estimated at "wide over 50 percent".
The refurbishment was "returned for two years".
Half of his employees had to get rid of him.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half had been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently.
Instead, government president Jörg Schmidt replied to a request from Göhner whether there could be a financial compensation, indicating that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location at B 27. Now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation.
Göhner knows about other districts, where such a more generous thing was handled.
In all complaints, Göhner is confident that his restaurant will continue.
Finally, the family business has been located here since 1715, he points to the long history.
He can understand that other regular guests are now less often passing by because of complicated traffic management.
If you can't drive here, it's nice somewhere else.
That his clientele returns after the completion of the renovation work, Göhner has no doubt about it.
Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhner maintains the effects of the B 27 construction work on his clientship for the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long-standing history.
Six months of construction work, that's already brutal.
In the name of the fight against terrorism, laws are constantly being scrapped.
After the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière now presents a thick security package.
But what does a state of tolerance have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the conciliator.
All of his proposals were "politically reasonable" to the coalition partner, the Federal Minister of Interior said in presenting his new security package.
You're not asking anybody.
Other, further points would initially be discussed within the parties.
I'm also a part of it.
As Minister of Interior, however, he was based on results and on an "attributable consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière spent a little time before presenting his conclusions for security in the Republic.
But they are now all the more likely to do so.
Some things are already known, announced, suggested: That a new security authority should take care of the cracking of encrypted communication is not new.
Nor does Germany need to implement several EU regulations on passenger data and arms law.
The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising.
In part, de Maizière starts a second call for proposals that have not yet been dealt with with with the SPD: He wants to penalise sympathy for terrorist groups, and push jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD", the CDU man admits.
He still thinks this is reasonable and does not demand anything, which the coalition partner has no chance at all.
A few new ideas will also be presented by de Maizière.
They have it in themselves: He plans quick procedures for deportations and more possibilities for detaining people before deportation.
Refugees who are targeted to be taken to the country should have their smartphones checked before and should disclose social media accounts for a security check.
In the case of tolerances for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than before - for example, those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to conceal their identity.
Some of them are politically and legally sensitive.
Some of them also seem unexplained and leave questions open.
And on some points - for example, when it comes to the unequal treatment of the patient - the question arises: What does it really have to do with security and terror?
Yes, de Maizière says it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terrorism.
But it can't be argued that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about security in view of the high number of refugees.
And things that were deeply occupied by people were not allowed to go away even in election times.
Internal security has become a major focus.
Only the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are elections.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in favour of internal security.
In recent days it has been high between the two parties.
First, there was a ghastly dispute over the armaments of the federal police, then about a security policy collection of some of the EU's interior ministers, in which the chiefs of the department also demand a ban on Burka and a return from dual citizenship.
De Maizière also strives to make a conciliatory tone.
He's not holding anything from a double pass.
We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.
They're reopening, don't make sense.
And in the case of a Burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether its own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner, it has to show itself.
There's a lot in there that could cause a fight.
However, the SPD is also currently trying to profile itself on the subject of internal security.
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel gently signals willingness to talk and says, "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security."
Volkswagen still comes through funny.
Despite diesel scandals, delivery figures worldwide are rising.
But not all markets are running around.
During the recall action, there is vortex around a term.
Volkswagen starts with deliveries of performers in the second half of the year.
Despite its many brands and some of its well-running markets, Europe's largest automotive manufacturer can continue to show an advantage in the course of the year.
In July, however, the core brand VW weakened mainly in Western Europe and thus repressed the total sales, as the company listed in the Dax announced.
In July, the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles in July than in the previous month, with 449100 cars.
Only in Western Europe, after China the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous month.
In the home market of Germany, deliveries fell by almost one-sixth.
Brand Sales Manager Jürgen Stackmann brought down the weaker figures from July mainly on two sales days less in Europe.
In addition, in some core markets, there has been a backlog in "change in the economic environment".
In addition to the situation surrounding Turkey's coup d'état, the British vote on withdrawal from the EU also called for a spokesman.
In the U.S., where the exhaust gas business first escalated, there is also a minus to beech.
Large support for VW is the Chinese market.
In all, the mainly affected house brand of the Lower Saxony comes through the diesel scandal.After the first seven months, only a 0.9 percent drop-out to 3.37 million vehicles is available.
Group sales manager Fred Kappler continued to show a sales price from January to July.
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time, 5.904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated with a software exhaust test.
In Germany alone, VW calls around 2.5 million cars to refurbish the workshops.
In the course of the upgrade, VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars did not have any negative effects.
After the refurbishment of vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.
After the upgrade, the car builder issued a "guarantee-like" certificate to the customer, but do not refer to a "guarantee", as it was called on Friday in corporate circles.
Reasons were legal subtleties.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now provides its German customers with a guarantee for refurbished diesel models.
This would have been confirmed by VW representatives at the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.
The meeting was confirmed by the Ministry of Transport.
"VW has to fully comply with the requirements of my investigation commission and the KBA."
"Derogations are not accepted," said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), according to the Ministry.
VW has assumed the guarantee that there are no deteriorations in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance after the conversion and all vehicle type-approval-relevant values remain unchanged.
Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee", however, as it was called in corporate circles.
With the broad term "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility that, for example, half a year after refurbishment, customers will come to a workshop with a motor damage - and this could be traced back to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
In the interest of customers, it was also important to avoid any other damage, which has nothing to do with the exhaust gas scandal, becoming an uncertainty about possible warranty arrangements, as it was called.
This is why VW does not use the term "guarantee".
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee requires rich savers to pay fines in future - as the second institute in Germany.
Bank manager Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on giro or daily cash accounts".
The Bundesverband Deutscher Banken speaks of an individual case and sees no signal in it: Normal savers "should not be afraid to pay for their savings gross penalty rate".
If banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay their penalty interest 0.4 percent.
This fee will be charged to Raiffeisenbank Gmund from private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros on giro or daily cash accounts from September onwards.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros per year," said Paul.
For some time now he has been guarding 40 million euros, which could be lifted from one day to the next and which he could not use.
"They're in my bank account and they cost 0.4 percent," said the bank manager.
"I can't spend every million euros."
The cost is now passed on to the polluter-pays principle.
Just leaving the cash in the vaults of the Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous: "I've had four attacks already, I don't like the fifth!" said the bank manager.
Most customers had understanding and changed to other forms of investment.
Only a few migrated to other banks.
The Bayern Cooperative Association stated: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy rate is causing considerable costs to all banks".
To carry them alone is "not possible on a permanent basis".
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or transfers.
The Thuringian Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with its 2014 Skatbank file with penalty interest for deposits from EUR 3 million.
Michael Kemer, Managing Director of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect private customers to have to pay a comprehensive fee for deposits, for this the competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is far too strong".
A banker said that at Lake Tegern it gave "a clientele, which is a little more plentiful from the fortune".
"This can become a problem for a small bank" if it keeps money free of charge.
Founded in 1911, Gmund co-operative bank has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
Known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region.
"No other banks are currently known to the cooperative association Bayern, which calculates an allowance for deposits from private customers," said Spokesperson Ernst.
At the end of June, the President of the Bundesverband der deutschen Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, had declared: "The threshold, to go into negative towards the private customer, is very, very high".
Competition is hard, and it threatens to move investors to competition.
Customers in Germany will not like this in width.
Destination Plates: who actually buys records?
Lonely men of middle age love plates.
Before you rush to comment on it under the pseudonym NotAllEinsameMenMenMenMenMenMen with rough insults, this statement derives from current data.
According to YouGov, the highly discussed resurgence of records is not due to a millennials boom that wants to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently bought a record are very likely to be between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
It is also not a horde of hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers keep their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are the results of YouGov correct?
If this blog were a news report on TV, the camera would follow me as I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wear a modest gray suit and steal wildly before I stop, hold my hands and say something decisive like, "So, let's take a closer look at it."
So, let's take a look at it.
Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I am standing in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observing.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men middle-aged) to the Reckless Records (data number: eight men middle-aged, a woman, probably around 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I guess so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), undress the walls of his living room.
The reason why he owns such a large number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and to buy again items that he sold when he was young and plowed.
"Many things I buy are from the late '60s, early '70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things I was probably too young to buy them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy plates are more introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
That's my vice.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets are true to the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people that are influenced by the media hpe, people who have heard about the comeback and who are getting ready to buy their old records again.
Of the talks I have conducted, people have usually done away with their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says.
That would explain to the tree the followers of the record revival of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional meaning of plates?
It only takes a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers were inciting the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar record shells, from objects that awaken happy youth memories.
"I think sometimes it can be the filling of an empty or the possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says Wez.
That's what I'm talking about as a collector, and I think it's like that for a lot of people.
It is an easy way to engage spiritually.
"We are like their social workers!" a staff member floats off a record pile.
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not heard them yet.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not have a record player.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look very concerned as I browse through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data number: three men of middle ages), has noticed a "trophäen aspect" of the Revival.
"Someone just came in here and said, "I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead record so I can put it in the shelf," he says.
This is not a large percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-intensive, less music-intensive.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older ones, who just come in slowly.
Fopp, who dedicated almost an entire floor to the records, has a colorful audience when I walked in.
There are couples around 70, tourists taking photos, teen boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beast's newest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz drooping from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers.
None of them look lonely, but nagging psychological traumas are difficult to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been in business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of the plates for sale.
She's more of a windowbug than a big one.
It doesn't deserve much, so the collection of records is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It is easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of records is..." it runs off with a infatuated sigh.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I seem to sample the Jeans Hotpants, I watch a group of young teenage girls grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter consider buying a Crosley record player.
On the left is a stairwell, a wall full of tops of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.
No one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far up there that it is impossible to touch them.
It's pure "platting".
But considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It is no surprise that a population that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends the most on luxury items like records.
Even if my research revealed that the results of YouGov are correct, they leave aside, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.
These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday morning strolling through plate shops on Berwick Street and sheets through plates, while avoiding the staring gaze of an unspeakable, 30-year-old false moderator, who does not raise any unsuspecting men of middle age over the shoulders.
The Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - video report
Scientifically say that the Greenland shark has the longest life span of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who examines sharks, says that the record was in a female that assumes that it is between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long
French court refuses offer of demolition of shops in the jungle refugee camps
A French court has rejected an offer from the authorities in Calais to demolish dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
In a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the State should be empowered to tear down 72 provisional shops in which persons inside the warehouse sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
The prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which pose a fire and sanitation risk.
Humanitarian groups informed the court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also stated that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people who did the 72 provisional business, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais "are clearly understandable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the areas offered quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that was threatened by the low-rise was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the Camp, which is run in vain and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum cases for hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure "was a disaster for these children, of whom the youngest eight years are old."
The two relief organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle had risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number so far - after a steep increase of new arrivals during the summer.
Despite Olympia disappointment: Martin remains fighting
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympics, Radprofi Tony Martin does not want to be defeated.
"I keep looking at the World Cup, stay confident and fight further," the 31-year-old wrote on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook.
He has no explanation for his miserable 12th place on the sugar hat.
"I honestly find it hard to comment on yesterday's time trial," said Martin.
He had to analyze in peace what reasons had led to the debacle.
At the time trial World Cup in October in Qatar Martin actually wanted to win the title.
"I'll look at everything we've changed in recent times."
"This also includes my position," wrote the three-time world champion, who had lost more than three minutes on Wednesday to the 54.5 km Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland).
Olympia: Tennis pro Siegemund misses semifinals
The victory march of Laura Siegemund ended in the quarter finale of Rio: The world ranking list 32. from Metzingen missed by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-Nr.
34) the semifinals of the Olympic Tennis Tournament.
Siegemund, who was plagued by back problems, was able to pass through her notice only once and seemed powerless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, Medallenhoffnung Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2) had the chance to jump to the preliminary round.
The Australian Open winner met the Britin Johanna Konta (No. 10).
As the last German tennis pro, Tommy Haas had won a medal (silver) in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB starters in the quarter finals of summer games had recently been in place in 1992.
Never before stood a German duo in an Olympic single-half-final.
Group starts up with start-up for live video game transfers
Other people watching video games is a giant-centred - Microsoft wants to benefit from this too.
The technology group buys the start-up Beam, which specializes in this hobby.
How much money is going on for the takeover, Microsoft did not announce on Thursday.
Beam started with his offer only in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others play, but you can also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions and contrast enemies as well as provide equipment.
The playerie Activition Blizzard launches a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook should help.
The advertising industry is already watching.
The employees of the start-up, which so far has its headquarters in Seattle, Washington, are moving to the Microsoft headquarters in the California Redmond, as Beam co-founder and Chief Matt Salsamendi announced.
Therefore, the takeover is not intended to change anything for customers.
According to Microsoft, Beam is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The market of live streaming of video game activities is growing rapidly.
Known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was purchased by Amazon online dealer in 2014 - for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming belongs to the Google Mother Alphabet.
Here comes the Force Trailer
Germany's Raser needs to adjust to the next generation of speedometers: In various federal states, including Hessen and Brandenburg, new lightning devices are being tested, which are intended to transfer tempo sinners particularly effectively.
The futuristic Force Trailer of Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, to focus on accidents where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, there is often no infrastructure needed at motorway construction sites or to refurbish bridges with temporary speed limits to ensure compliance with speed limits with a stationary flasher.
However, permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or elaborate.
The Enforcement Trailer is authentic: its battery lasts five days for continuous measurement, the case data is encrypted via a modem.
Laser measuring technology also allows all vehicles to be recorded over several tracks at the same time.
Variable speed limits as well as transit bans according to time, lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored.
You can move the trailer in its state, according to the manufacturer, with each car with trailer coupling.
In order not to be easily stolen, it is lowered in the measuring operation, so that the wheels disappear in the armored and, by the way, also bulletproof outer shells.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is designed to protect the lightning device from vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer has been tested according to Vitronic in various federal states and is now also used.
Also foreign authorities flash with the new technology: Most recently, France has ordered 100 copies, after an order of 150 pieces last year.
United Kingdom gets silver in the 7th Rugby after Fiji Masterclass gets gold
The impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7th Rugby took place in the final on Thursday evening at a abrupt stop at the last hurdle in the form of Fiji, when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master class in handling, side-stepping, reversing, line running and raw force to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad price of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on this day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinal on the same day could fall back on them in the final.
But no matter what, Fiji would have beat a 15-man team in the best form.
It could be a comfort to GB - but it probably won't - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's chief coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult way behind.
Eight years ago, she lost every game in the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan.
Here they just lost one.
This slip is painful, but progress is amazing.
Fiji started off wonderfully and caused GBs to frighten off.
It felt like running in driving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co., the World Series winners went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau hit the corner.
With four more minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he transformed.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
A high-end tack of Mitchell stopped reaching the mountain of Man Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but it just stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua left a touchdown in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the recapture and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravousu presided through other weak tackles of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a goal.
The conversion resulted in a 29-0 until the break.
It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.
That's the way it is.
GB made fundamental changes to the half-time and closed the Fijian gap...for a whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time, until Joshua Tuisova ran through a brilliant intermediate play by Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had been running for a long time in favor of the South Sea Insulators, whose fans sang, flagged and danced on the stands.
It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fiji.
Mata Viliame put the i-dump with another attempt in the last seconds.
The piff sounded, the Fijis hugged themselves, and GB kicked to death beat into the lawn.
Earlier in the day Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight semi-final match from the race - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the boxes up the front in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal among the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside Team, secured the prize - and with it the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the coach to row victory
There won't be any emotional gold than at these games and that's what's going to be called.
From the first rowing to the last, 220 hard Hieve, which goes into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional significance in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Although there were only the two of them sitting on the rower, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of the coach Robin Williams, was omnipresent when they rowed to the second Olympic gold in the second without the tax lady in a row, the first women in the history of British sports who set such a standard.
Her dominance was absolute, at least her 39th unbeatable effort, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the kind of triumph to goose.
Behind every gold in the row is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference, and there was no one more helpful than the coach who didn't know 30 months ago if he would ever survive that day than he had been diagnosed with cancer.
Like he said, he was risky.
I had bladder cancer, which is operable, and they did.
If you don't do that, he'll spread everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the view a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky that he was being treated at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if under such circumstances this is the correct term at all.
I needed money, so soon I had to get better.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.
That's how it starts.
Rowing itself is already a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.
In the instantness of the victory her first thoughts went on Williams, who spent a nervous morning with it a little more than usual and tried to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was a captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment in an operation in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. That might be a bit extreme, but it means so much."
It only repeats how much that means to me how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anybody, so a massive thank you goes to him. He's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have wanted a better person to train or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to open up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught right now.
Helen called "Stand in the process, stay in the process."
It's really important not to be torn apart.
We had a good start and at the same time we didn't want to do something great.
We didn't want a fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, whatever we did.
The couple will take a period of time for a year before it will make decisions about its future.
Glover must appear next week at a wedding, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed out.
Here it took about four minutes.
It feels so much better," she said.
For 31 years model for clarity
The managing director of the "Veitensteingruppe", Ruppert Göller, is retired.
The association is regarded as a "bay-wide model".
A small Franconian drinking water community as a model for the large water producers.
Some time ago it was called in the original ton in a contribution of the Bayerischer Rundfunk.
Soon after, the Water Forum of the Government of Unterfranken recognized the purpose association.
The work of the Veitenstein group was entitled "bayernwide as exemplary".
Rupert Göller, who worked for 31 years in the Touchverband, is 28 years old as a managing director.
Now he was retired at the age of 65.
The Veitenstein Group's drinking water community, based in Kottendorf, Breitbrunn, promotes about 150000 cubic metres of water each year and supplies 32 villages and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.
The municipalities are Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities.
The current chairman, Breitbrunn's mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was appointed waterguard in 1985 and was already appointed CEO of the Touchverband in 1988.
"His tasks have been very diverse and they ranged from water pipeline construction and maintenance work to office and organisational activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergencies on weekends," said the president.
As outstanding events, she mentioned the start-up and start-up of the new well (1994), property purchases in the area of the new well (1998) and compensation for farmers, the renovation of the high tanks (1999), the re-acquisition of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipes.
There has been no stoppage and one has kept taking innovations because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her laudatio she praised Göller's faithful, reliable and correct service for over 31 years.
He has spent a lot of heart blood on his body of water and he has lived the body of water as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he had been allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein Group for nitrate lowering in front of the Water Forum of the District of Unterfranken.
He has received a great deal of recognition and praise for this.
On the other hand, Rupert Göller praised Alfons Griebel's waterguard, who had worked with him for 28 years.
He is the best waterguard and he was a faithful button.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
From his point of view, he referred to well construction and the restructuring of the purpose association.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult use were, however, the tube break at the high tank at Kirchlauter on January 3rd.
Here it was necessary to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the villages could be supplied with water.
Also, the supply of Neubrunn could only have been maintained once because the tanks of Pettstadt were filled with hoses.
The management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who takes up the successor of Rupert Göller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko openly turns to the autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other affected parents: "You must have the courage to talk about it."
"The medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old of the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When the illness was recognized by her son, she believed that she had to die.
However, Tiago, eight years ago, has progressed well and is now learning privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example, if I ask him something that goes back two years when I sang the Milan Scala, he doesn't remember anything," said Netrebko.
But he is the happiest person on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's association with the bass baritone Erwin scrap.
She is now married to the tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Country of relationship in Bargteheide - Man shoots at companion
A 35-year-old man shot his partner at a multifamily house in Bargteheide (Kreis Stormarn) on Friday around 10.45 a.m. and killed her.
"The man himself called us and indicated that he had shot his partner," said a police spokesperson.
The perpetrator was on the run after he was publicly given.
Meanwhile, nationwide, Sven S. could be on the road by car.
The man is about six feet tall, muscular, brownish and has a glass.
Meanwhile, the police have published a photo of him.
It is, however, a few years old.
In the meantime, the man wears a glass.
The man is not to be addressed directly.
He could carry the gun with him, the police said.
If you see Sven S, you're supposed to call the 110.
The police are talking about a "relationship state".
The victim was the year 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
The responsible police in Lübeck did not want to make any information about the tattoo or the relationship between perpetrators and victims, but she confirmed that a human being had been killed.
"It's a death penalty."
"We don't say more at the moment," said a police officer in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a Special Forces Command (SEK) was at the scene of the crime.
Steel - light view for German steel industry
The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs to millions.
Financial burdens threatening the sector from green electricity promotion are off the table.
It remained during the liberation from the renewable energy environment at the existing plants to the so-called own electricity production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday issue).
"I'm really glad that after two years of tough negotiations we could finally reach that."
Thus, the European Commission first planned to request the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace for their own consumption.
According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel told WAZ that there was now a basic agreement with the EU Commission after discussions with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in the steelworks will an EEG conversion of 20 percent apply.
But these too are not to be found in the steel industry.
The IG Metal welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on electricity generation.
The status quo of the previous scheme is thus largely defined.
The successful efforts of Gabriel have a special significance for the steel industry.
"With regard to our steel campaign, this is a first step."
"Further have to follow."
"Emissions trading reform also considers climate and employment goals," said IG Metall Chief Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and significant price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.
Last year, the situation continued to worsen, as the world's largest producer country in China, due to the weakening domestic demand, threw massive steel into the world market.
European producers propose price dumping for Chinese steel companies.
Over the course of this spring, the situation has been somewhat relaxed.
On the one hand, the imposition of import duties on imports has had an effect, and on the other, the economic outlook in China has been remedied.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry primer Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Last time the prices had stagnated.
The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude the closures of individual works.
In the German steel industry, around 86000 people were employed at the end of 2015.
In July, despite rising prices and increasing orders, German steel manufacturers remain cautious.
At 3.4 million tonnes, they produced six percent less crude steel than in the previous month, as the Economic Union for Steel announced on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the manufactured quantity now declined the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production has fallen by two per cent below the previous year's value.
In the coming months, thanks to an improved order situation, the association expects an increase in emissions.
Community, Spirit, Health: Singing does seniors well
The singing has already accompanied Ursel Kipp her whole life: As a young girl, she was in school choir, in the teaching studio she took part in music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a test, she feels more balanced, happy and alive, she says.
By the way, she does something good to her health and to her mind.
Because Singen is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Seniors League.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of the music, says Hackler.
Through regular association, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.
Because often social and family structures resolve at age, then a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "To speak up and organize, to be able to rely on and learn from the others - a choir is a very special form of being together".
Singing can be strenuous in the positive sense, says Hackler.
For seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.
Anyone who regularly demands his lungs does not breathe out so fast in everyday life.
Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice at an age, singing is an optimal hobby.
Singing often has a very special effect on older people," says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour Association of the Senior Workers' Organizations.
In the older generations the joint singing had a much higher status, it was a daily part, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.
Lenz frequently observes that singing or listening to songs in older people arouses many memories, often associated with positive feelings of her youth.
Through lyrics and especially melodies, even people with dementia escape from long-term events.
When singing, the head is also required to perform a special performance, explains Lenz.
At the same time, concentrate on your own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone practice this way not just to focus on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition given by singing in the choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
The self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.
To show myself: If I practice for a long time, I will get better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.
So good reasons to start singing are enough.
If you want to try out a new hobby, don't hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, you can guess.
You don't sing on your own - in 50 singing people, who hears when a tone goes next to it?
Looking for the right offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler.
If someone from the band sings in a senior choir, you can just join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.
If you want to sing in an ecclesiastical choir, you can contact the congregation or the head of the church directly.
Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.
If you don't have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbors can ask for help in the Internet search.
Anyone who wants to sing should definitely join a choir, advises Hackler.
Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - this applies to every age.
Cats respond more sensitively than cats to the cries of the young
Biologists in Hanover have investigated the effect of calling cats babies on adult animals.
To her surprise, Miauen also did not leave the males cold - but they were always the same in contrast to the females.
Female cats can see the exhilaration rate of cat babies at the Miauen of the Little Ones.
They react ten percent faster to sounds of kittens that are in great need, such as scientists from the veterinary university and the Medical University of Hanover (MHH).
Cats also respond to the calls of kittens - but always the same.
"The acoustic differences between the Miauen of less and more excited young animals are apparently not perceptible or of importance to the males," said biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study to be published this Friday in the "BMC Evolutionary Biology" magazine.
In a previous study, the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kittens' screams differed from the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight kittens from the MHH were observed.
They were played for one cry by little ones who were taken out of the throwbox for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with screams by more excited kittens, which were additionally raised.
The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the small sample.
"All the females, even those who had not yet their own offspring, responded differently to the cries," Konerding said.
They turned around more quickly to the speaker when this cry of the very excited kittens was played.
This ability may be inborn or developed with sexual maturity.
"A surprise was that the males have responded at all," said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have studied the reactions of women and men to baby sounds several times in humans.
Also, some studies showed that women responded more sensitively to infants, no matter whether they were mothers or not, the biologist Marina Scheumann reported.
Podolski handles with "Gala" after Supercup
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest warrant was issued against the former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
An important football game takes place in Turkey for the first time after the coup attempt.
Before the duel of the archivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clearly: "Business as usual" is announced.
Even when the state of emergency was being imposed after the July overthrow attempt, the government was not to be affected by the everyday life of ordinary citizens.
This does not apply, however, to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who are responsible for the coup attempt.
It is not made before football.
The former Starkicker Hakan Sükür was arrested by the Procuratorate.
Thus, the current practice in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür is to be a supporter of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is held responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Although the state of emergency initially imposed for 90 days still applies until October, this actually has virtually no impact on the lives of most Turks.
The nightly "democracy guards" on public squares throughout the country declared Erdogan to be finished on Wednesday.
The sport - like the whole country - is divided into followers and opponents of Erdogans.
Especially fans of the work club Besiktas are traditionally not one of the president's friends.
But what the great Turks have in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military coups.
Even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
With Pokalsieger "Gala" it will particularly come back to Lukas Podolski.
In the end of the season, the Cologneer proved his sporting value: with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first time as the top scorer of his club.
In the final match against Fenerbahce, he scored the 1:0 victory match.
The newspaper "Fanatik" cheered him: "He was the best in the place."
He finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team the Cup.
Thanks to "Poldi", the disappointing season for the record champion found a conciliatory conclusion.
After the pre-run K.o in the Champions League, the "Lives" also shoot out early in the Europe League.
In the Süper Lig it was only six.
The season wasn't good.
The Cup was the only way to win something.
"We did this and that's the most important thing," Podolski said.
For Master Besiktas the game year ran better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who with 26 season hits as Süper-Lig-Torschützenkönig laid the foundation for the 14th title.
This is also the reason why the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
In doing so, the Gomez, who had only been lent to Besiktas under contract and under the terms of the agreement, had announced that he would not return to the country due to the political situation in the country after his term of office.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say," said the magazine "Kicker" Club Manager Fikret Orman.
But if the storms had to be prepared to give up about one third of their estimated annual salary of 7.5 million euros, Orman made it clear: "We can't pay his salary at Florence."
Despite Doping: These athletes still have medal chances at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already blocked twice for dopings (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanoa must not start in Rio.
Other transferred athleticists can only laugh at it - they fight for medals in Rio.
The topic of doping continues to determine the headlines at the Olympic Games in Rio.
The Russian swimmer Julieta Jefimowa, who had filed an appeal after a doping lock just before the games, was mercilessly picked up and bent out at her start (100 meters chest).
There was a scrumptious scene: With a smile set up, she was still stolled in the hall and had provoked her appearance.
When it was found that they were not going to get gold, the audience broke out into a cheerstorm.
However, there are many other athletes who are taking off at the Rio Olympics despite the doping past.
Here's an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-Stefel/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He was already blocked twice for dopings (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his career, the 2004 Olympic champion and ex-world champion run even faster than before, he is over 100 m in 9.80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the biggest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-m-Steffel/Jamaika): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion had to remove a six-month barrier in 2010 after proven use of the pain agent Oxycodon.
She had strong dental pain after surgery, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (Diskus/Croatia): In 2011, the Olympic champion from 2012, the World Champion from 2013 and the European Champion from 2010 to 2016 was tested positively on the prohibited stimulance medium methylhexanamin.
Perkovic fights the knowledgeable intake and was blocked for six months.
The four widest throws this year go to the account of the great gold favorites.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-Steffel/USA): The Beijing Olympic champion and two-time world champion over 400 m, had been tested positively in 2010 and was blocked for 21 months.
A device for penis enlargement had been responsible, Merritt claimed.
This year the 30-year-old is over 200 and 400 m the fastest man in the world to date.
Ivan Tichon (Hammerwurf, Belarus): Hardly any athlete was subsequently awarded so many medals.
Tichon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later, after his testosterone doping was established.
The currently 40-year-old also had to give Olympic Silver 2004 because of steroid dopings and the 2006 EM title due to testosterone abuse.
He also received the bronze medal at the 2008 Olympics on the basis of a judgment of the International Sports Court CAS.
At 80.04 m, he ranked two of the world's rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km Go, China): The world recordler and gold favorite was only tested positively in May, but may still start in Rio.
The 29-year-old world champion found evidence of the use of a prohibited food supplement, the barrier of the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA fell mildly and ran off already on July 13th.
Bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Multiple dead
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand was in contact with the woman, said the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.
She had suffered cut wounds and had been treated in the hospital, but she had already been able to leave.
She planned her home trip for the beginning of September.
Whether the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon also affect Austrian citizens is still unclear.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities, according to Schnöll.
Located about 200 kilometres south of the capital city of Bangkok, Hua Hin first exploded on Thursday night in an outing district of two bombs.
According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three German, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two bombs went up again, killing another human being according to the authorities.
Phuket also reported a bomb explosion in the early days.
A taxi driver was injured in the detonation near the beach Patong popular with tourists.
In Surat Thani on the southeast coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban employee.
According to the authorities, the bombing had gone into the air in a flowerbed in front of the Coast Police.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast as well as in Chumphon on the south-east coast called for several injuries.
One goes from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it said.
"The bomb attacks carry the same handwriting," said army general Danai Kritmethavee on Friday morning before journalists.
"We assume this is a coordinated attack."
It is too early to speak about possible motives - probably, however, it is about the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the Muslim separatist bombings in the south of the country.
The Thai police, on the other hand, stated that the attacks were not related to the Islamist uprising movement or to international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok.
Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
In recent days, the authorities have received classified information on impending attacks in the south of the country, but they have not been informed of the exact time and places.
Still be unclear which group was behind the attacks.
The police instructed their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings, airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
In Thailand there are always smaller bombings, but they usually do not target tourists.
In Hua Hin lies a palace used by Thailand's king Bhumibol Adulyadej over years.
Following the multi-bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on its website recommends that the instructions of the Thai security authorities be followed.
High safety risk (Safety Level 3) applied to the provinces Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihar and surrounding area.
After conflicts between security forces and Muslim sections of the population, non-necessary travel to these provinces is not recommended.
Increased safety risk (Safety Level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution prepared by the military junta.
This gives the military a great deal of influence in the coming years.
Junta Chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs had been an attempt to cause chaos, while the country was moving towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
The militaryunta, who had taken power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, is pleased to have brought the Kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has not managed to get hold of the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years.
More than 6,500 people were killed in the conflict.
Nearly a year ago, 20 people had also been killed in Bangkok during a strike on a popular Hindu scream - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the most bloody attack of the recent history of the country.
The right "Identitarian Movement" has entered the vision of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
After several national offices, the constitutional guardians in the Federation also put the group under observation.
"We see evidence for efforts against the democratic rule of freedom at the 'Identitarian Movement'," said Constitutional Protection Director Hans-Georg Maaßen of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
For example, immigrants of Islamic faith or of the Middle East are defamed in an extremist way.
That's why we're watching the movement now.
The "Identitarian Movement" is a group with French roots, which has been active in Germany since 2012.
She turns against "Multiculti-wahn", "uncontrolled mass migration" and "the loss of her own identity by alienation".
Constitutional protectors in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - already observe the "Identitarians".
Maaßen said that his authority was closely in agreement with the state offices in the decision.
"Groups like the 'Identitarian Movement' are trying to pick up their target group where it stands," said the Head of Constitutional Protection.
In general, extremists try to speak them with youthful language, often with poppy music.
That's what Islamists did as well as right-wing extremists.
This is not an important advertisement for one's own business.
The propaganda is supposed to appeal to the people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
That's dangerous.
Last time, there had been reports from several federal states on "Identitarian" contacts with AfD politicians.
Maasten said he had no knowledge of this.
For the protection of the Constitution, possible contacts of this kind would only be relevant from a certain point of view.
It is important that the party in question - in this case the AfD - changes its objective and becomes extremist by certain people who are extremist.
It is therefore crucial whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is not recognizable.
In view of the significant increase in legally motivated crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee accommodation, Maaßen said that he would not yet be talking about new right-wing terrorism.
But we have noted in recent years that there can be legal terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freitaler group.
It may well be that other right-wing terrorist groups or microgroups are planning attacks on asylum seekers, refugee homes or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives.
However, legal terrorism cannot be controlled across Germany or across Europe.
The previous groups were formed at regional level or in social networks.
Concerned about the fact that many abuses went to the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene.
This is the worrying thing.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum accommodation had not previously been known as criminal, politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right scene.
"Many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who may have been politically different or, for example, have opted for CDU, SPD or left, but who have radicalized themselves by means of right-wing extremeism".
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes the Internet Hit
Not always do the Olympics or world records determine the headlines at the Olympics.
This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was temporarily no longer visible in the TV images.
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut-out was selected.
In the social networks Habte became a viral Internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old finished his lead with a minimum of 48 seconds and finished 59th place of the starters.
But it was rather his not exactly sporting figure that attracted the attention of international media.
Why is the 24-year-old still participating in the Olympics?
The Ethiopian got a special starting right from the international swimming association.
This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries more known.
Because most athletes run in Ethiopia, Habte just wanted to do something different.
Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros Hafte is ready for the big race.
The first nicknames quickly made the round.
Some media called him "Robel of the Wal".
The English boulevard magazine "The Sun" made fun of him with "Dad Bod" in reference to a "bowbowbow".
His time, he only struck with one minute and nearly five seconds over the 100 meters freestyle, played no role.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also made.
At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, the race of Eric Moussambani provided media attention.
The appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea was unforgettable when he had to take a course of more than 100 metres freestyle alone.
At that time Moussambani was fired in French.
The 22-year-old then learned to swim only eight months before Olympia and had never taken such a long distance before the competition.

Geretsried - The owner of a store at the New Square has been robbed.
According to the police, 67-year-old Geretsreider had left her business on Monday at 5.30 p.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor.
When they came back around 8.15 a.m. the next morning, they had disappeared from the cash register about 250 euros.
Traces of the perpetrator could not be found.
There is also no video surveillance.
Trump does not see the threatening electoral defeat so narrowly
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at an election campaign event in Florida.
Should there be no choice for the US President, Donald Trump has an alternative idea.
He's going on vacation.
Donald Trump loses the U.S. presidential elections in November, it wouldn't matter to him: "Recently it will either work out, or I have a very, very nice, long holiday," said the Republican candidate in a phone interview with the US TV station CNBC.
If it was not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness, it was all right, said Trump.
Thus he called the US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, the founder of the Islamic State of terrorism (IS).
Within his party there was more and more resistance.
Post enters the trade of electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle of the German Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the company is apparently high.
The post office also plans to sell its electric vehicle StreetScooter.
The Group will soon start trading with the transporter.
The post will also offer its electric transporters on the free car market from next year.
"We want to get into sales to third parties," said a post-speaker on Friday.
The company has been testing for months whether to sell to other companies its own developed StreetScooter, with which letters and packages are delivered.
Jürgen Gerdes' Post Board had said that there were constant demands, for example from craftsmen.
According to information from the news magazine "Der Spiegel", the Bonner Group is about to enter mass production of the vehicles.
The company plans to build up up to 10,000 cars a year and a layer in its own factory.
Gerdes had announced that the Group wanted to increase its fleet of electric cars significantly and in the long term a complete change to the environmentally friendly vehicles.
"We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine changing the whole fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany's roads since 2014.
GfK management resigns after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK is replacing its head Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly - but not quite surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK suggested that the chair of Chief Executive Officer Matthias Hartmann will be all the more uncertain, the longer the success promised by him remains.
Turbulence at the top of the Nürnberg market research company GfK: After disappointing business figures again and the company management's resignation, the global number five of the industry is in front of a new job start.
GfK CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors Arno Mahlert is already resigning from the Supervisory Board on 12 September.
As early as 1 September, the Management Board member Gerhard Hausruckinger informed the company.
He should officially assume the function of a "Chairman" until a successor was found for Hartmann.
As a reason for the withdrawal, the company called "different views" a long-term policy orientation.
Details didn't want to call a company spokesperson on Friday.
Those who will lead the market research company in the future are still unclear.
In investor circles it was said on Friday that the shareholders were most recently disappointed by the continuing success of the restructuring initiated years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the GfK summit since 2011.
"But the fruits of the restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years," it said.
Given the last bad GfK business figures, each shareholder would at some point become restless.
"If this were the case with BMW, the quandts would do the same," it said.
The company had not been able to stop its loss journey even in the second quarter of 2016 after setbacks in the previous quarters.
At EUR 361.2 million, turnover was 6.1 per cent below the level of the comparable quarter of the previous year.
Compared to the first half of the year, sales decreased by 3.4 percent with EUR 721.2 million.
Profits in the second quarter have been particularly negative in view of the difficult economic situation of the company.
The company value depreciation of 139 million euros, which became necessary in the Consumer Experience division, resulted in a loss of 148.2 million euros to the Group.
In the second quarter of 2015, the GfK had generated a consolidated profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus slides into Kurmhorns in Tombs: Eight Injured
In the event of an accident involving 43 seniors as passengers, eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummhörn (Landkreis Aurich).
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, the police reported.
The 66-year-old driver on the bus of a traveler from Eisenach had to deviate from the driver who was on the counterroads, according to his data.
The bus came to the right from the road and slipped into a grave, as a police spokesperson Aurich/Wittmund reported.
"Because of the location of the bus, people could not leave the bus independently," she said.
The fire brigade freed the inmates.
Six rescue cars and an emergency car came to the accident site on Landesstraße 2.
The unharmed travelers were taken back from a regular bus to the Krummhörner district of Pewsum.
There they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
The investigators asked the trucker and possible witnesses to contact the police.
The fees per cubic metre of waste water are from 1 October 2016 for the area of the wastewater treatment plant Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl 3,44 instead of 2,10 Euro; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lop 3,36 Euro (up to 2,26 Euro) and for Azendorf 3,64 Euro (up to 2,18 Euro).
At the plant in Azendorf, the waste water fee will be increased at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.
After an excessive calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be at EUR 4.37 per cubic metre.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, the Landratamt Kulmbach found that there were undercovers for these wastewater treatment plants when approving the budget.
The Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the facilities in a cost-effective manner on the basis of legal bases.
From 1 October 2016, the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to take a deeper look at the purse.
The fee increases range from 48 to 67 percent.
As the administrative director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the panel, a new calculation of the fees for the waste water treatment facilities of the market community was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- and under-covers from the previous calculation period were also compensated.
The serious increase in fees was due to Schmidt’s concern for all three wastewater treatment plants with a very small wastewater attack between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year.
Thus, due to the low distribution base, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious effect.
In addition, waste water was slightly reduced in all three plants.
Furthermore, during the previous calculation period, not least due to their age, the recovery and repair costs had been significantly affected by all three plants.
The plant in Azendorf was almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that in the waste water plant Azendorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage.
At the Welschenkahl pump plant, the nearly 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overtaken from the ground and at the Lopp pond clarification plant, the first sewage pond had to be excavated after almost 20 years of operation, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation possibility had to be installed in order to comply with the water regulations in the future.
Schmidt: "These extraordinary expenses were borne by the continued care and maintenance costs, which should be taken into account in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which were significantly below the current level when the previous calculation was made in 2011/2012.
Stone houses made it clear that, in the small wastewater attack in the three plants, the expenses for the operation and maintenance "are well passed".
In addition to Schmidt, the market community had been spared from major entertainment costs in waste water treatment plants over the past 20 years.
In the view of Steinhäuser, the situation for these plants will continue to be precarious in the long term, given that the area of supply of the Friesenbachtal wastewater treatment plant cannot be extended because it is a deficient facility.
Bulgaria booked for the first time in 8 months inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first over zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% were recorded.
The average annual inflation rate over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8 % according to the CPI.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0 %, i.e. the monthly inflation rate was 1.0 %.
Inflation since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed compared to the previous month: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and shoes (2.2 %); furniture, household appliances and routine expectations (0.5 %); health (0.1 %).
As in the previous month, prices remained for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; apartments, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education remained unchanged.
Snapchat "anime" effect criticized as Asian caricature
Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way as to limit the absurdity.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog, or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are unblemished, properties distorting tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All mistakes are made to the public.
Snapchat filters have been criticised in the past in which they were accused that the Blackface app would promote or promote white skin as a beauty ideal.
When a few users proposed a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and humiliated cheeks this week, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asians - "Gold face".
They wondered whether these repeated controversys pointed to a major problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it had disabled the feature.
The company apologized: The filter was intended as tribute to anime characters and not as a caricature of Asians.
But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of hurting clichés.
Others decided to reject the Anime comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student, whose tweet was widely spread over the photos, wrote that the filter "was offensively unpleasant to me."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow face has been drawn into the degrading extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural ostrich wires.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless struggle for diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat's large audience of young people - who are in matters of race more diverse than their older counterparts - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat's filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, "it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed than it was before," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to cancel her Snapchat account, asking others to do the same.
In an essay for medium and in a phone interview she said that she believes that race-related controversy reflects a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices at Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the mostly white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hash day: #DeleteSnapchat.
"They neither have a different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors who work there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that has left Snapchat largely unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees, but according to one speaker, the company has recently employed a personnel manager who focuses on underrepresented populations and on internal integration efforts.
Zhu said that she would leave her snapchat account closed and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this isn't OK."
Military management falsifies ISIS intelligence information, establishes Congress Committee
Military members of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic state in Iraq and Syria than it would have allowed the actual state on the ground, reported a Congress Committee of Inquiry in a report on Thursday.
The provisional report, prepared by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, the Secret Service Committee and the Military Budget Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their views on the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, shortly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Nachrichtendienstlicher Information, which was typically cut off by high-ranking Centcom commanders, regularly drew a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than it would have allowed actual conditions on the ground and were more consistently positive than analyses of other intelligence services," one newspaper article quoted the report.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership errors in Centcom reach the top of the organization.
The 10-page report presents detailed and consistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.
Although there is no direct indication that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts saw themselves under pressure from their laws to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before Congress were much more positive than the facts," the report stated.
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a Mossul military recovery could begin in April or May 2015.
Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, so much is clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican congressman from Kansas, in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the leaders of the Central Command changed the intelligence reports to deal with the danger posed by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans called the Task Force to life after they were played out that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be supplemented by more detailed findings during the investigations.
In addition, further investigations by Centcom are under way by the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defence.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which were consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In the years 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an excessively restricted process for the production of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced the highest-ranking democracy in the Committee, a member of the Adam B. Schiff representative house, in an opinion.
This process, said Mr. Schiff, "has delayed the publication of intelligence reports", damaged morals among analysts and "has given excessive little room for dissenting opinions."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats stated that they had not found any evidence of a White House intervention with the Centcom analysts regarding a "certain political opinion".
The preliminary results of the congress investigations were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast".
Last August, the New York Times reported on investigations by the Pentagon's general inspector, who was admitted to the hospital following a complaint by Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press spokesperson, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on congress reports while the investigation by the inspector-general was still ongoing.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have quite diverging views about the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."
The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under the leadership of the United States in Iraq and Syria (a claim made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).
The allegations of last year, however, raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds us of disputes over more than ten years ago when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document on how the then government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, provided only a small crew in Iraq and spent little time thinking about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic State.
Last year, the team around Mr. Hooker stated that contrary to government statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the terrorist group’s financial situation, as these provisional refineries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market.
However, this finding was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his excessively positive opinion of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.
The U.S. wins fourth match in the women's field hockey, a showdown with the UK is ahead
One day after she had shot three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of women in a match against India on Thursday that the Americans won with 3-0.
Five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said they couldn't remember ever doing that.
"I have no idea." she said.
I'm not one of the people who keep their gates in mind.
However, she knows this: The Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the British in the first place, which remains unbeatable after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
The UK and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter finals, the game will decide which of the two will win the first and second place within their team from six teams each.
The first place will take the strong Dutch women a little longer out of the way that the other group leads.
Whatever the game may end on Saturday, the Americans have caused a surprising vortex through their success story, four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 seats.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had a hockey bat in her hands for the first time at three years (their two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), at 16 years she became a U.S. national player, the youngest in the team's history.
She missed the Olympics in 2008 as she could not qualify for the cadre.
Then came the year 2012, in which she and her team lost everything.
In the following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became a coach of the national team, and with it things began to turn to better.
"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.
We didn't have the work penance in London that we have now.
We've been able to pull the rudder all the way around.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a handshake from the nearby area.
India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team turned out to be surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands.
She completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and walked the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.
The Shutout was the first of the entire tournament for the goalkeeper of the United States, Jackie Briggs, who had to book one goal each in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position" said Parnham, but how well will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.
Amidst the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampoline
Wherever you are, however late it is, it is the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a raging race between competition and striving.
It's as if the Olympic torch itself was a burning staff, which is handed by the crossbreeder to the gymnast to the triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is at the Olympics for the first time and a women's black with dimples, could well have been among those famous names that are sent to Prime Time, built up by sponsors and wellness TV advertising, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a fighter.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline tournaments.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event the same.
Further from the center, partly in the shade, there are the sports that are not generally recognized: air gun shooting, archery, Badminton, Taekwondo.
We will always have the breast swim and may long rule it.
But if I should modestly make arguments for my particular favorite, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it has been so sparsely perceived over the past 16 years that many I had questioned did not know that it is an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and by 2012 had an athlete who made it to the final round.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians who for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline jumping has a certain external charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unsolved ear for a clown school than for the Olympic Games.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a ground-bound enthusiast.
It has humorous potential - the cardboard-like tremors of its never to end the impact - but also the grace of the tournament and diving, the two sports that unite it essentially.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as "brace."
Achieving victors jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost 30 feet into the air and need a series of falling movements (travels, slopes and salttos) before they land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed according to performance, difficulty and "flight time".
Twenty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will fight against each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.
Medallenhoffende must continue in their pursuit of gold, faster, upwards and beyond, sometimes to the goal, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.
They not only hunt for the target line or the starting wall, but in television transmission they also pursue another hazy goal: that of the world or the Olympic record.
The goal-oriented pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to stir even a spectator to tears.
But it's also what I feel myself when watching these games as something tiring.
The trampoline offers a breather.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she shudders, apparently unhesitating like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
Here too there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It's as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can be.
The women's qualification and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time; the men's on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days starting at 14.00.
In the middle of the Olympia Mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in general Tumult.
If the raising of consciousness can only be achieved by the adjournment and objectification of male athletes - as the male U.S. towerers have recently suggested according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his ringing for air, his new convict.
"A generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia encountered violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say that tens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police during shooting.
Is Ethiopia breaking up right now?
Over the last ten years, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government have shaken the country and spread in more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government’s response was unmerciful.
Witnesses reported that police shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
In circulation, videos about the protests that are probably from the last or early of this year show how security people beat young people with sticks, while forced to make a handstand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now calling for an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia, according to Nigeria, is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.
American military and secret services are working closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorist threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western help.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.
His infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continually led the repression by the government - opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents effectively silenced.
Many were sent to exile or to prison, killed or driven to the far desert.
But that could change.
"If you suppress people and these have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.
The whole youth protests.
A generation of protests.
There are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to wickering in terms of power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now controls 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions rise along the border with Eritrea; a struggle for this delicate, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists, such as the Oromo Front or the National Front for Ogad Liberation, who have been defeated more or less in recent years, can exploit and rearm turbulence.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of simmering under the surface are now exploding.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and Internet services have improved.
Even if the government stops access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet practices that hide where they stop.
Several young Ethiopians said that they gathered for protests.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since the eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands, have been practicing politics and economics while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in flatland areas.
But that too is changing.
"We are coordinating under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromos.
The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, who make up about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military, secret services, commerce and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was the prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death on an unpublished illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.
Analysts say that he was especially keen to perceive early signs of dissatisfaction and use special agents to process opponents and make them harmless.
"The present regime lacks this basic skill," said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take up Mr Meles' position.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such an uproar in 2005, after thousands of protests against elections, which, according to analysts, seemed to have been neglected by the government and subsequently stolen.
During the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in the last months and this time of unrest went by relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leader for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for their measurable progress in combating poverty.
But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal displeasure of the Ethiopian government.
And she takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month protesters in Gondar, an amharic city, took action by Tigray, and hatred of the Tigray is becoming increasingly common in social media.
Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a strange position.
The American government used Ethiopia as a basis for drone flights across neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it has concluded this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin walk of gratification."
Donald Trump explains his claim that Obama had founded ISIS as "Sarkasmus"
Donald J. Trump tried on Friday to disperse the last controversy that surrounds his campaign by stating that his repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, would not have been the "founder" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
This clarification raised new questions about the communication capabilities of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and intelligibly with the American public.
It also brings his associates who try to protect him during an eventful phase to the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he could not have meant at all.
After he had made the point at an election event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump returned to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The tweet was the contrast to the previous day, on which Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant the accusation completely serious.
When conservative radio moderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump weaken the statement somewhat by reminding him that Mr. Obama is trying to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate didn't want to know about it.
The last storm of criticism hailed Mr. Trump as he tried to direct the focus of his campaign to the economic situation because of falling survey values.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.
Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found their speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already presented Sarkasmus to his defense.
At the end of July, he took strong criticism when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but he later said "Of course I thought that was sarcastic".
This method allows Mr Trump to move the linguistic boundaries of politics and then to row back as needed.
"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary, "clarify" depending on how the reaction turns out." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert watching the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of deflecting the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more corrosive tone, as his polls have continued to decline.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a guided tour of the state of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-on-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or of misinterpreting his humor.
But while he is in the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have brought his loyal associates into the uncomfortable situation of having to stand up to him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, made great efforts to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview of Thursday.
"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was questioned about the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statements as to whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
In this sense, it is true that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown little organization, he called it hindquarters, completely wrong, and that is why it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs Clinton served as Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to expand by avoiding aggressive control of the situation in the Middle East.
Before the elections in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of riding around on each of his words and being biased against him.
He mocked the "poor, miserable" TV experts who tried to understand him and said, "You can't do it!".
Some of the Democrats scoffed at Mr. Trump's apology as just another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidential office.
Once over the price squeezed out of the market, Café returns in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shady café in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash, which had no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, prices were pushed out of its Bedford Avenue Ladenfront.
The Soap Cherie business, which replaced the verb in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals attributed it as the last loss in a refurbishing city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is a change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea hotel is excluded and verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York's changed, it's a new invention.
A revived verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepted credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old café, who is the owner and manager of the new café.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a client offered him money for a new outpost, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, contributed a lot.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment too.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes like capers and sautéed onions.
There are nature travel bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, there are fresh juices for it.
After nine months Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.
"Many old customers were also displaced by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34 years old, lived in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she'd take the road.
After the verb had closed, she gave up coffee for a while, she said.
"I realized that it was at the coffee and culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even if on that day she ordered a Blended Chai Tea instead of her usual Iced Coffees, which is another addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work and inevitably always ordered the same thing.
"I came quarter after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they were preparing my Everything-Bagel with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and include new ingredients in the menu.
Today Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his everything-bagle with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said that he had no resentment that the soap business had occupied the old business.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for verb with the cold brewed coffee of the café as an ingredient.
"I think we're going to go into her offer," said Rodriguez.
And the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoint also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said that he plans to exhibit it soon so that his new neighbours will feel welcome.
The site also has further advantages.
A local juice room would like to fill and sell the cold-brown coffee in bottles.
There is a chance that the café will expand to a neighboring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular student and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the place and ordering a new coffee felt like a return home.
"I had to smell that," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a plentiful meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his accession to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a fine taster, President Roosevelt had a failure for refined delicacies on Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu on this day was a bit more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato purée and a plum pudding as dessert.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to the Americans how to eat."
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes' last book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in the USA, while Ziegelman in her book "97 Orchard" tells about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Their latest collaboration, "A decent meal", which will appear in the Harper publishing house on Tuesday, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snorkelless snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the exchange crash in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with potato and vegetable mix ate.
When the reporter ordered Hackbrates, the couple found this appropriate for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression.
"Real food was very popular," said Ziegelman.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.
Coe laughed.
"It must have laid in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pastés were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war. "A Square Meal" records the ways with which the land was associated, not to be the land of slaring.
"It was a time when food for Americans became a central, tense theme," Coe welcomed why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was equally tense: mysterious food such as bread and cashrolls became a staple food, the cashier's role as a "wonderful way to recycle food residues," noted brickman, as cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, has become a rarely served luxury.
Unique mixtures were tried out, as a high-calorie and nutritious satisfaction prevailed over taste or even healthy cuisine.
During her research for the book, which includes recipes, brickman prepared a dish from this era, baked onions with peanut butter.
"There was no popular addition to lunch," said Coe.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions do not match each other.
It was typical of many of the household economic recipes.
As never before or ever since, budget economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - promoted the country's eating habits in this way.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "housewives" and the challenge of turning pamps like creamy spaghetti into delicious meals with carrots.
"A Square Meal" is a feast of historical treats.
In particular, the reports on the government's response to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-me-kuchen-Essen-Haltung, are tasty.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchens of his kitchen, he fed like the million heavy man of the world to whom he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a tuxedo.
He was a wonderful stranger to reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not asked him to set an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, housing a housekeeper with no interest in tastes by Mrs. Roosevelt led the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most consolingly prepared."
Many of the species from the era of Great Depression to deal with food were discarded as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as on how science was applied to food.
When writing the book, the couple said that they understood the eating habits of Zieglman’s mother - in - law better — for example, how she could not throw food away.
"She had a real fear of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman remembered: "She actually made people sick."
There was the windbag incident.
After the plates had been cleared at Eisenberg's, they and Coe produced a dessert that they had prepared at home: the plum dessert, the President Roosevelt ate at noon.
"It's called Prune Whip," said brickman and added that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes a chic name.
There was no beaten cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone was reluctant to dip a spoon into the tough, brown glibber.
Surprisingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe got a hit three times.
Like a can-do farmer, he said to his wife, "A few chopped walnuts would help."
Killed by bombing: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life on the line to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save the lives of others.
Now the 30-year-old died even in a barrel bombing of the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group that, according to picture newspaper, so far saved almost 60,000 lives.
2900 volunteers risk their own lives to draw people out of bombed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civil guardian who showed him in an 11-hour rescue of a infant from the ruins of a house, went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a shining symbol in the horror of war.
As a hero, however, he never saw himself, silently said, "For me, this is the real jihad."
"When I die saving lives, I think that God sees a martyr in me."
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the last bombings in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one filled with chlorine gas.
One woman and two children died, seven people suffer from respiratory distress.
"We now eliminate the toxic remains of the bomb, so that children don't play with it," the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The Assad regime's deadly bomb was supposed to have hit terrorists.
Greenland shark: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - to this day.
Greenland sharks only grow at 150 years of age.
Unfortunately, the Greenland shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, on average just 1,220 meters away in an hour.
Only when it comes to it, the five meter long animal accelerates to a depth of 2.6 km/h - and at this maximum speed is half as fast as a seal.
This slow-moving lifestyle, however, seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least of a Greenland shark who could be 392 years old.
"Insanity", Alexander Scheuerlein comments from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock on this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.
Although the evolutionary biologist has long suspected that Greenland sharks are being stoned.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, after all they live mainly in the Eisme against the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they appear on the surface mostly only in winter.
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.
They measured their pace of time as they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitzbergen.
However, prey makes this shark: In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.
They may be hunting sleeping animals or patrolling at the bottom of the ice cream and looking for cadaver that dries down from higher layers of water.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now investigated 28 Greenland sharks, which fishers took from the depths of the North Atlantic in front of Greenland or Spitzbergen between 2010 and 2013.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest size was 502 centimeters.
To determine the age of the animals, they analysed the lens nucleus of the shark using the carbon-14 method.
This center of the eye lens occurs before the birth of the shark, the proteins contained in it are no longer renewed.
The two smallest sharks had a striking amount of carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.
Their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, when nuclear tests carried out on this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
The lens core, on the other hand, contained a small excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear tests with a length of 220 centimetres, so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012.
All larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lens nucleus, which are produced by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14-hour for a 493 centimeter long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters should be even 392 years old.
The fact that Greenland shark weeds only get young when they are longer than four meters was known.
Now the researchers of the length were able to assign an age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably at the threshold of sexual maturity and his age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks can obviously be multiplied for at least one and a half centuries.
This too is likely to be a world record for vertebrates at present.
The fact that such methusales live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenlandwal, in whose bacon mounted a 120-year-old harpoon peak on the neck, was also caught in front of Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there is often also running on a spa flame.
So they mature later - and age slower.
In addition, in order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often particularly large.
For the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much greater than that of a gram of elephant.
Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal thus lives more dangerously and should focus on having as many offspring as possible early as possible," explains evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources in a long life.
Building ground in the double-pack
In the recent meeting, the municipal council focused on construction issues.
With ease, the board took up the message from Mayor Robert Putz that "the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can finally begin".
After the land, parceling and development issues have been clarified and the applications for measurement have been made, the sale of the land in the residential areas "Straßelweg" and "Schönau-West" (Bereich Binderstraße - Ausbau section 1) is no longer in the way of interested parties.
The municipal council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet district of Schönau address young families and up-to-date elderly alike.
As it was called, construction volunteers can now report in the town hall, and the council will probably discuss the award of the parcels in its September session.
In order to be able to meet also requests for the establishment of other commercial establishments, linked to the creation of jobs, the Council decided to amend the land use plan in sub-areas, which was only drawn up in spring of this year.
Thus, in the area underzeitlarn, the commercial area already designated there is expanded by two parcels towards state road 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city on Main thus has the best chances of attracting jobs and companies transferred from London in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
"Frankfurt is very likely to benefit most from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtländer, head of the IW's competence field of financial markets and real estate markets.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses may continue to operate from London from financial markets throughout the EU.
For the so-called EU passport, they have so far been approved in Great Britain.
This is taking advantage of large US banks.
Several banks have already announced to shift jobs.
The "Frankfurt Main Finance" lobby association expects 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, the IW, the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB), talks about the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks of the euro area, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisor EIOPA and the ESRB Risk Board.
In Paris, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its head office, but it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity to the bank is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with the supervision," says IW professor Voigtländer.
Although Luxembourg has a large fund sector, Dublin and its infrastructure are less sensitive.
Frankfurt was much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
In addition, point the city with easily available commercial properties.
"It's not as easy to find free high-quality offices in Paris," Voigtländer says.
At Seine, the rents for first class commercial properties were also 50 percent higher than on Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime.
In a ranking of Mercer's corporate advice, the city was ranked 7th, Luxembourg 19th, Dublin 33rd and Paris 37rd.
Although quality of life is a matter of preference: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract other banks and investors," says the IW.
However, despite Brexit-Votum, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, the economic researchers believe.
For this the power ratios also speak: In London, according to figures from the Landesbank Helaba, around 1,400 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015, in Frankfurt there were 62500.
Gilead receives legal fees from the Hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement of the legal costs arising from the Hepatitis C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was freed from a $200 million damages payment for the violation of two patents by Merck, which were associated with the blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni from Gilead, after a US judge discovered a pattern of misbehavior by Merck, including the myth and other unethical acts.
At the hearing on Thursday, U.S. magistrate Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to the payment of the costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck tries to compare Gilead with the market for a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued for each other and claimed ownership of laboratory work based on Sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in the Gilead medicines.
U.S.-supported troops say they have regained complete control of Manbij from the Islamic State
U.S.-supported troops have recapitulated full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city have left them, said a spokesperson of the group on Friday.
The Democratic Forces of Syria (DKS) are sweeping through the city after the withdrawal of the remaining group of fighters who have been buried within the city.
They have liberated more than 2,000 civilians held by the fighters as hostages, Sharfan Darwish told Reuters, the manby military council allied with the DKS.
"The city is now under complete control, but we are just doing cleanup," he told Reuters.
Clinton earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published its 2015 tax statement, which resulted in USD 10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2% for the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband.
In 2015, Clinton's USD 1 million donated for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.3 million in speech fees; the former Foreign Minister gave a USD 3 million income from Simon & Schuster for her book about her term in office at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's candidate for the Vice-Presidentship, Senator Tim Caine from Virginia, together with his wife Anne Holton, published his tax returns over the last ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency," said Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri in an opinion.
In contrast to this, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and withdrawers regarding his previous promises to publish his tax statements.
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although they are not required by law to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.
"They're on the train," wrote Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams on Twitter, regarding the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's Special Advisor, said to CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish something before the tax audits have not been completed.
Trump’s critics, including the Republican presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mitt Romney, have already stated that his refusal raises issues regarding wealth, donations for charitable organisations, his business gestures and various other connections, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already crashed on the topic and released a video on Friday on the Internet, in which high ranking Republican Trump asks to publish his tax return.
On Thursday she also addressed the topic during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax returns." she said to the crowd.
Politico reported that during the 1990s, Trump paid no or very little taxes for two years, and a New York Times economic journalist quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advisers on Friday, indicating that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that people who earn more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a election campaign for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska called for Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate has its seat here, Trump for a meeting to exchange their tax returns.
Buffett said he was also subject to a tax audit of the IRS and Trump had "fear" before the voters and not before the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign published tax returns back to 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid on average an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The Clinton tax declaration of 2015 showed that it only received USD 100 of its income as a wage, unlike most of the Americans.
Its main investment was a cost-effective index fund from which the Clinton dividends and revenues of USD 109.000 taxed.

Condoms with Chilipuder, fireworks support Tanzania's elephant protection
Nature conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox species to prevent elephants from going to settlements inhabited by humans - they throw condoms on them filled with chilipuders.
The method has proved to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea to do so years ago, together with US nature conservation, has intensified its promotion by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-level method to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Previously, many spears used to defend themselves.
Friday is the Day of Celebrity dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we have developed the ... toolkit, we have been able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities, while they are much more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephants," said the manager of Honeyguide Damian Bell in a communication.
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn.
If it is not deterred, a so-called "chili cloud" is thrown.
Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom, the end of which is turned all the way to the ignition cord.
When it is lit, the condom bursts with a bang and sprays fine dust on Chilipuder into the air.
A touch is usually already out to chase the elephants.
One last possibility is a thrower who shoots a gold rain fireworks into the air causing a loud, bright explosion.
Stadtrat decides unanimously: No kioskneubau on the St. Goarer Rheinifer
Normally, the St. Goarer investment projects are accepted by business operators with a kiss hand - especially the retail trade in the core city is considered to be clearly expandable.
However, the City Council now unanimously rejected the request for the new building of a sales kiosk on the Rheininifer in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony in the construction.
"In principle, we welcome new business operators, but this kiosk does not fit in with an exposed location on the Rhine in this location," explained Michael Hubrath for the CDU faction.
Jewish director smashes Berlin Hotel because Israeli pre-election has been removed according to "Arab" request - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media riot after he had betrayed that the Kempinsky Bristol Hotel in Berlin had not listed any Israeli pre-election, as it had "requested" Arab guests according to an employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentation "Shoah" let out his anger at Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's pre-election list.
However, the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center.
Looking for an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there was "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel staff said that the measure was "an intentional decision of the management of Kempinski hotels."
The reason behind this caused even more anger in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre-election be deleted," the staff of Lanzmann was quoted.
The Israeli ambassador in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame," reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were horrified and disturbed by this event.
That's really embarrassing.
The fact that this has occurred in Germany in exactly this chain of hotels is an even greater disgrace.
That doesn't need to be explained.
We expect the hotel to draw "the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident triggered a rather great response on the Internet, where people called the whole thing a scandal.
Some assumed to the Kempinski Hotel that it had "given" the alleged demands of Arab guests.
It was said in another article, which pointed out that the hotel located on the noble Kurfürstendamm is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly identified all the accusations and called the incident a "accident" and "explained" at Lanzmann, says Der Spiegel.
"There was never a direct instruction", Israel was not included in the Quick Dial list," said the Süddeutsche Zeitung, a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country pre-election has now been added.
Police use tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
On Thursday, students met with the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when they gathered to demonstrate against the government's reforms for the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the demonstrators.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to disassemble the students, causing the police to use rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their dismay at the plans.
According to the proposals of the Governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, a little less than 100 public schools are closed, while 300,000 students are implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen spraying graffiti on walls against the provisional President Michel Temer.
The recent protests took place a few days after protesters in masses went on the streets to support the suspended president, Dilma Rousseff, who had been expelled from office by a Senate vote on her resignation.
Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent annually.
Since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, interest on the part of Russian companies has grown strongly in trades in the country, the ambassador announced.
Russian companies enter into existing links with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the greatest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports in Iran jumped by 91,5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade upturn was achieved by supplies of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," said the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan is based on a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year.
Last year, the Russian foreign representation issued around 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, Iran reached the top 20 of the countries with regard to the number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year are broken," he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes it will change.
"I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd that the monuments of ancient Persian civilization have been preserved in a good condition," he said.
Witnesses Seeked: Drinking Market Invaded in Waldbröl
A robbery was committed on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Rewe XXL on the Waldbroöler Gerberstraße.
Subject to a gun, three darkly dressed persons who had disguised their faces from the beverage market demanded the issue of cash and then fled on foot and then probably with a silver VW golf.
How much money has been spent, the police don't tell us.
The perpetrators are said to have been between 1,60 and 1,70 meters tall, that is, relatively small.
The beverage market is directly accessible and poorly visible from the park deck of the Rewe market.
After the attack, the perpetrators must have run towards Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and fled from the gravel parking lot opposite the car entrance with the silver car, possibly towards B 256 (Schlädernring).
Anyone who has made observations at the time of the crime (at 7.45 p.m.) in connection with the robbery is to report to the police urgently.
Nagold: fun and play at summer leisure
Eight nice and happy days the children and young people of the social education group/group work of the Children's Protection Association Nagold spent with their caregivers during their summer leisure time in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quiet Freizeitheim Hardtwälle, the lively group was quarted during the first week of school holidays.
Several full-day trips were on the program.
On the one hand, it went to boards with the visit of the strike zoo.
On the other hand, after Maulbronn, where there was a special children's guide in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
In the Keltenmuseum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the everyday life and the food of the Celts.
On the hot days, the group enjoyed the deep sea in Maulbronn, which invited them to jump, swim and plan.
Culinary children and carers were spoiled with their self-prepared body meals such as the Sauren Spätzle, the Seebronnner Pfännle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English Breakfast and Tübinger Bologna.
In workshops, beautiful jewels of pearls and stones were created or made of wood into a Roman mill game.
Further highlights of leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings at the fire and the final "Bunte Abend".
On the day of the journey home, the sun laughed, and the children and young people returned home happily.
Haigerloch: Pilgrimage for the Gate of Mercy
The ministers from the Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Four stages were taken together.
In order to bridge the time until the next Rome Wall journey of all Ministers in expected two years, the St. Anna's Chief Ministerial Round has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various pilgrimage goals were examined and a final decision was made for the Bishops' City of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage was offered with the opening gate of mercy at Freiburg Münster.
16 Minis from Bitelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Saints went their way.
On the evening before, Father Storost sent out the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the cross of pilgrims and granted the pilgrims a blessing.
From Horb it was taken by train to the starting point of Villingen, where also a Münster of Our Lady stands and the pilgrimage of the Münster was started.
The individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and scriptures.
But also on the way, the Minis continued to relax at field crosses, chapels or churches to sing a song of their own collection of pilgrim songs.
For the nights, parish homes of the local parishes were available.
At the stages Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast.
On the second day, Furtwangen went on to Gütenbach.
On the next day, one started the stage after St. Peter, which was the most strenuous route, but in the event of a cool heat it had to go down about 500 metres and then climb again.
The deserved reward was a shared barbecue at the bath-weigher in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing Monastery of St. Peter, it went to the final stage to Freiburg.
Apparently relieved and happy, the minis met later in the afternoon at Freiburg Münster and passed through the gate of mercy.
With a small impulse, God was thanked here.
In the evening fair in Münster, the Minis arrived at the pilgrimage destination were welcomed by Cooper Markus Obert.
After worship, the pilgrims could visit the Sacristy and the High altar.
The next day was still time for the Breisgaumetropole.
In the afternoon it went back to Horb by train.
At the end, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Shott Callum Skinner storms home when Brite gets gold for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced fame last night in the men's team-sprint in the Velodrom in Rio, when the British team defended London's 2012 title.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took on the anchor roll that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made himself his own. The boy spund proudly made the legend when he stormed home to return a victory of the favorite New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after taking only a modest sixth place in March at the London Railway World Championships despite Hoys' resignation.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.
They did this in time as a hindrance.
Hoy's retirement caused a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they remained with when they saw potential in the Scots that had now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealand won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was barely back after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.
A change of strategy made up a large part of the transformation, during which obstacles went into a higher corridor to slow him down and allow Kenny and, above all, Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy looked out of his position as a BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they stepped on the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
In the final round, we made a record of the Olympics and won the World Champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 Triumph on the Kennys and Hoys side, Hindes admitted that after a weak start, he deliberately fell on the track.
He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.
This time, there was no such problem with such an outstanding victory.
Hindes said, "It feels like the whole GB flag on the stands like London."
We've been together for the last three months as a team.
We got away so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, won seven out of ten titles both in Beijing and in London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrom.
With the form Kennys it is possible that he repeats Hoys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
This would mean for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly sacred date for British sports; born on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - an proceeds of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That would be Hoy's.
Kenny will take part in the Sprint, which will start today and go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I only enjoy this for the moment."
The team event is always best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a little lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the Knight."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometer race.
They arrived at the destination in 3:51,942.
The world record won in 2012 in London Gold was 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the bet, where Wiggins will certainly be in the focus.
He had been fighting with staff before the qualification yesterday when officials called him to measure his body size.
In the corresponding women's competition, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in world record time in 4:13,260.
The GB team relies on its strong team to dominate the middle period of the Olympics and to bring a crowd of medals.
After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were dropped.
Dramas played in the background, so the technical director Shane Sutton retired in April in the midst of sexism and bullying accusations as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in Velodrom, it looks quite like that the now legendary reputation of GB, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated.
The future of Portland's melting process due to the repeal of the Energy Treaty
The future of Portland's aluminium meltdown in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers' jobs - is at stake as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and will terminate all supply contracts as the supplying energy company announced.
This step followed the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year not to grant any further subsidies on the plant's operation.
A 20-year fixed subsidy will expire in November.
Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.
No less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.
Furthermore, there could be domino effects, as the melting industry consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity produced by Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry melting plant, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's meltdown in Portland loses money and risks closing.
This step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and, lastly, because of the electricity price of the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting industry with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, reported that it is expected that three other owners will terminate their contracts.
The plant is owned by a majority joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means a further physical demand for electricity through the melting industry," the company announced.
AGL continued to announce that the contracts were so-called "security transactions" which should have entered into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will end in 2017.
"That is why AGL expects the contracts to contribute to revenue in fiscal year 17," said the electricity supplier.
All potential effects on AGL's revenues from the GJ 18 onwards are currently limited by forecasts of the strong forward markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL reported that it had already written off the value of the contracts in its annual closure of $187 million in "expectation of termination".
Alcoa said that the decision to book off the contracts does not affect the "ability of Alcoas... to operate the melting industry or to ensure the power supply to the melting industry".
The US company said that in 2010 it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which should have entered into force from November this year, even if it is still due to an explanation why it has resigned from the contract.
Analysts warn against the possible closure of the Portland melting plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economic conditions of the industry.
In reference to the analyst's statements at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes about 600 megawatts and tomago about 900 megawatts of electricity every year.
Should both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [power market].
And it wouldn't be good for us as a power generator," he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner Clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.
Kendall, the brand ambassador for Estee Lauder, who ran on Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on their Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The disclosure of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the Kardashians similar?), scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of problems Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the ever-popular showbiz uncles and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as they forgot the cover of their sister and ended with a classic turn: they all planned a surprise party.
This represents the cliché action of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we'd forgotten you?" with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a radio station at 8 a.m.), but Kris had to have her other girls participate in this publicity somehow.
With regard to the September edition of Vogue, a new era of Cardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's great sister Kim likes her beating on the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on display in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for themselves.
The September issue is for Vogue the most sold edition of the year.
With a volume that resembles a tape rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were advertising from the 832 pages of the rolling miller 615 pages).
The disclosure of his coverstar is expected to be so longing that in the last two years, pictures of the magazine have been leaking before official announcement.
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there has been clearly more "famesome models" than "models that are celebrities" on the cover.
Oscar award winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honour.
But even with the small chance that Ms. Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or youths of today who know how to make a good Snapchat video (even if it all applies to Jenner).
They are truly talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, Jenner's success does not all like.
With its reality TV history, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense.
In June, the former Victoria's Secret Model, Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague, Gigi Hadid, criticized her and called her "the craps of the moment."
These feelings boiled up again when the news came out with Jenner's appearance on the Vogue cover.
But riding around on suspicion seems to pass the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of Vogue.
She is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.
She runs for Marc Jacobs.
She's advertising your founding of Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Paywall apps.
She sold pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, she's on Reality TV, probably just to see her sister, Kurtney and her kids.
Municipal rights centres reject 160,000 people per year
More than 160,000 of the country's most in need of assistance are rejected annually by the local law centres, while the sector is concerned with the impact of further cuts in funding on already overburdened transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly people, immigrants, workers in need of help, victims of acts of violence and those who do not have funds for unjust debriefing and similar - are already rejected when applying for free legal advice and assistance.
Legal services of the community, which are already over-exploited, are ready for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal centres are expected to lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
The director of the common law centers of Queensland James Farrell said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Law Centres revealed that thousands of people are already being rejected every year.
Farrell said that the situation would only get worse without the Federal Government's decision being lifted.
"Queensland's community rights centres are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are rejected by important services you need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with insurmountable and oppressive debts, families who go through separations, workers who have been unjustly released - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows that they can't get the help they need.
As of June 2017, the Federal Government will cut the budget by 30 percent, which means that thousands of more needy people from Queensland will be forced to deal with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Federal Prosecutor-General and the Federal Minister of Justice and Senators of Queensland George Brandis to remove these cuts immediately so that people can get the help they need in the event of legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raising funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the community rights centres and their clients' communities, as well as that the government of Palaszczuk invests in this important work.
Donald Trump's election campaign accused after employees allegedly pulled a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was accused of alleged inactivity after she was told that her campaign leader for North Carolina had directed a gun to an employee in February while they were on their way in a Jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed by Vincent Bordini in the State Court of Charlotte on Wednesday, a former software programmer for the campaign in this state.
Bordini said to have waited for months that the matter would be regulated internally before he realized that "it would not happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "took a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and hit the race in Vincent's knee hole," put Bordini in his charge.
After complaining with the local and regional campaign management, Bordini found that at least four more people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the prosecution.
"Weapons don't have to be fired to cause damage," Bordini said.
The charge only comes two days after the Republican presidential candidate triggered a riot when he said to a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment People" - gun owners and weapons friends - should take action in the event of his rival Hillary Clinton being elected and judges appointed.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had ripped his words out of the context and that he would not incite him to violence.
Bordini's complaint demands compensation from the campaign for the breach of due diligence and from Philip for bodily injury and permanent mental damage.
Trump's press spokesperson Hope Hicks was unable to reach an opinion.
Attempts to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news station in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a member of the campaign.
Calls to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, have not been responded.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has previously led a controversial campaign.
The procedure is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Survey before country elections: Losing SPD and CDU
In the upcoming elections in the Federal States of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), significant losses for the government parties SPD and CDU are recorded.
This resulted in representative surveys of the INSA opinion research institute for the "picture" magazine (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition in the north could hardly continue to rule, this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin.
In both federal states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would thus have a good chance of continuing to make the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent to 24 percent five years ago.
According to the survey, the party was only close to the CDU, which could return to 23 percent.
The third place is disputed between the left and the AfD.
The left was 19 per cent (before 18.4 per cent), the AfD would be represented for the first time in the Landtag at 19 per cent.
Despite minor losses, the Greens hesitate again to enter the heavy land day at 6% (before 8.7%).
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the day-to-day period at 3 per cent each.
According to the survey, the SPD would only be selected at 23 percent (choice 2011: 28.3 percent).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
They were still behind the Greens at 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but before the Left at 15 percent (formerly 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented at 14 percent in the House of Representatives for the first time.
With 5% the FDP could hope for a return, the pirates would, in contrast to 2011, miss the move.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in time loop: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came to the market.
The successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, therefore it was also not well in hand.
On the contrary, it was quite clumsy.
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would reach today for about two selfies with high resolution.
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The Nokia 9000 Communicator came into business exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they kind of come from the Stone Age of the Internet Age.
20 years ago, however, the Communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as "the office in the western pocket format".
In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent and received a lot for standards at that time: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, also by fax was the Communicator to reach.
Even access to websites was possible via HTML browser, though painfully slow.
A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be folded up like a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.
The price was pretty proud: 2700 D-Mark, that is about 1400 euros.
The average retail price of a smartphone in Germany was EUR 392 in 2015.
Nobody in August 1996 could imagine that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then, everything has been different.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The Finns' cell phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster, was finally sold and handled to Microsoft.
Today the market dominates suppliers, all of whom came much later than Nokia.
Being always online and everywhere, that is today for a lot of people everyday life.
In 2015 there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices were sold, of which only 555 million were sold on Samsung and Apple.
Worldwide sales with the devices are around 400 billion euros.
In addition, the well-running shops of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies come along.
A whole industry has been developed around the smartphone.
The crucial breakthrough to the mass market only came in early 2007, when Apple Chief Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone on Mac-World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an Internet communicator, to easily operate everything via touch screen.
Apple’s winning train began, and today the iPhone is the company’s most important product.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who ruled the market, had the oversight.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
The saying now has Apple and Asian providers like Samsung.
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.
On average, every German nowadays looks at his cell phone 88 times a day.
"We all need to learn to remove the smartphone," said Janina Kull, the Siemens Executive Board responsible for staff.
Permanent accessibility is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time.
England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, as well as back in 2012 in London, when we were doing a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we will already create 10,000 new teaching places, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
Just as they were ahead of us in London in 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of Heathrow's enlargement is too great.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blaming ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question he asks.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individual infrastructure projects.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion of scientific growth and a legacy of skills and employment both for the airport and for the whole of GB.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion-price infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 - which was selected as the world's best airport terminal for five years in a row, to the T2 built in the middle of the two most frequented stages of the world.
Now they are ready to deliver a third step, which is supported by £16 billion of private investment.
The London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time that we steer this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in "Katz and Mouse Game" related to Adblocking
For companies that earn money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to bypass advertising blocking are equivalent to a "catz and mouse game".
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blockages on its desktop, Adblock Plus published a blog post informing users that they could update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the coding regarding its ads to make it difficult to recognize display blocks about which part of the site advertising is.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post the speaker of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of hin-and-her-campf between the advertising blocking Open Source Community and the surrounding community has been in progress since the invention of display blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has joined the fight is a strong indication of how worrying advertising blockers have become for the industry.
According to a study last year by Pageair and Adobe, around 200 million people use display blockers; almost four times as much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
The company has disregarded ads blockers on desktop PCs, as mobile ads blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a speaker announced.
Advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient proportion of the revenue, so Facebook’s investment in such a step seems to be worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its "advertising preference tool" to give people more control over their targeted advertising.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the page that is not advertising.
"For users, this is not a positive experience, so we are planning to address the problem," said a Facebook speaker in an e-mail message.
Adblockers are a muted tool, so instead we have focused on developers tools like Ad Preferences to put more control into people's hands.
Passing a woman on Swiss highway in the event of suspected suicide
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police are calling witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday was hit by a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the Canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman laid herself on the street in the dark "in an act of despair" and was hit by several cars, the police said in Vaud.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49, who was driven by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, said the police who asked these and each witness of the incident to report.
It opened an investigation procedure, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, and Gilles Hofstetter informed the Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown.
Was a collision avoidable?
This is something the prosecutor has to decide," Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not held responsible.
In each of the two cases - where one person ran on the highway in the dark - it was decided that the drivers should not assume that a pedestrian runs on the highway in the middle of the night as it was called in the newspaper.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of the negligent killing after crossing and killing a man who was on the A1 near Payerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street, the court heard.
The court found that the police officer -- who had responded to an emergency call -- was in a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the street was a "perfect extraordinary and unpredictable situation", the judge said.
Anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once habitable.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus may once have demonstrated similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2 dense atmosphere.
Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, groundlike atmosphere and, nevertheless, turned on slowly.
The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably showed more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protect it from rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matte.
"In the GISS model simulation, Venus's daily side of the sun is slowly rotating for almost two months," said Giss scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun's heat.
The result is average temperatures that are somewhat cooler than those of the Earth today.
The model produced a story of Venus similar to evolution previously suspected by planetary researchers.
Although she was once probably habitable, Venus -- over billions of years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
When your hydrogen was removed, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained behind -- the Venus, as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as coach of Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned as a coach and vice president of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, and led an insufficient right of codecision in the team's decision-making process.
Alternative President/General Manager of Colorado Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will seek a new coach immediately.
"In the last three years, I have fulfilled my duties as Chief Trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," Roy said in a statement.
Over the course of the summer, I have been thinking a lot about how I could improve this team in order to give it more depth, that it needs and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations must be perfectly tuned to that of the organization.
He must also have a right of co-determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are not currently being met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me today about this decision," said Sakic.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him the best for the future.
Roy was awarded the best coach of the league at the Avalanches 2013-14 during his debut season.
He led the club to 112 points and first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of Minnesota's playoffs and missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 brand in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the game for a second Wildcard spot in the Western Conference by five points.
As Hall of Fame Torwart, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North-sea oil workers again start discussions, strike off
The labour struggles over the remuneration of North Sea oil workers are being put off, while all the parties stand for a new round of talks, said the negotiators.
Strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were carried out sporadicly on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group as well as the Unite and RMT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to re-start the settlement process of the current dispute," says a joint statement.
We will hold a few full-day meetings in the next few weeks, which will begin at the beginning of next year in order to tackle the problems again.
The trade unions said that their last strike, the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
This year, Wood Group cut the rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The company's rate reduction is followed by a 10-percent decline for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional cuts give the company the space needed to get through the market downturn.
Shell has for its part released thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries, since it rationalizes its business activities as a result of its mega merger with the UK energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure as a result of the lower rosary journey, an economic situation which was strengthened by the British decision to leave the European Union in June.
At the beginning of this week, Scottish parliamentarian Dave Anderson met with workers leaders to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that have been taking place in the North Sea since a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few," he said in one statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion of expenditure for new projects in the North Sea is expected to be around $7 billion on average over the last five years.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of stars in the cluster of Pleiades
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalog of rotational rates among the stars of the Pleiades cluster.
The new data helps astronomers to understand why stars rotate at different rates in star clusters and in what context the rotation periods are associated with planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age, and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The cluster of Pleiades is 445 light years away from Earth.
Many stars in this cluster, which emerged some 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.
They're spinning the fastest now.
At peak rotational rates, these rippling stars emit large amounts of star winds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotational rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots.
The latest catalog of rotational rates indicates that more massive stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, with larger stars spinning slower pirouettes than smaller ones.
"In the "Ballet" of Pleiades we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.
Since the cluster of Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotational rates.
"The cluster of the Pleiades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
There is still a lot ahead of us about what we would like to learn more about how the how, when and why stars slow down their rotational rates and so to speak hang up their "dancing shoes".
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports their latest analysis of the rotational rates of Pleiades, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star resigns
The tears ran faster with Alex Rodriguez than the US Baseball Star in best days from Base to Base.
After his emotional resignation, the 41-year-old professional will be wearing the jersey of his New York Yankees on August 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays for the last time.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'Goodbye' to both," explained the 14-time all-star game player of the Major League Baseball (MLB).
Rodriguez was elected the most valuable player in the league three times, and won the World Series with the Yankees in 2009.
His signature under a ten-year contract gave him $27 million annually since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will be working as a consultant and youth coach at full pay.
As a player, it paid Rodriguez back long time with performance.
With 696 homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 the Yankees he made some milestones.
With the Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players have similar values in the main statistics.
However, the 41-year-old should not be admitted to the hall of fame of the baseball.
Because so successful Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the square.
Already in 2009, the superstar admitted to "ESPN", having banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013 he was blocked for 211 parties due to a transformation in the so-called biogenesis scandal until the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is considered as the main suspect to have received performance support for years through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a lawsuit, the lock was reduced to 162 meetings.
"The League could even have done me a favor for 2014 because I played for 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said Suffisant at the time.
Even his farewell days don't go silent.
While many baseball legends get the big stage again in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
"My job doesn't include a farewell tour."
"My job involves trying to win every game," Yankees-Coach Joe Girardi said.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and was told the relationship with popstar Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, received sympathy from fans of the Yankee Erzrival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod", the followers sang at the 4:9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Acquired: Due to a positive doping sample Adrian Zielinski, weightlifter from Poland in Rio must not start.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
A caught athlete would have almost won a medal.
Before the seventh day of the competition, the first official doping cases have become known to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre runner Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and excluded in Brazil - just before the start of the yet critically sighted athletics contests, these messages come to an instant.
At Chen last Sunday, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide had been proven, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.
The International Sports Court, CAS, confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old took the fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly, only at 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen should have participated in the careers of more than 50 m freestyle.
Chen has asked the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the opening of the B test and for a hearing.
The National Association took the matter "very seriously and requires Chen to cooperate fully with the investigations", Xinhua quoted from a communication: "We will work with the International Sports Court and accept the verdict".
For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.
Also in the night of Rio, the news about the positive sample at Danekowa went through, the 33-year-old went to the offensive himself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," this was "an incredible shock," she said to the Bulgarian TV station BNT.
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be food supplements," said the athlete.
According to the report, the prohibited substance should be the blood doping agent EPA.
Danekowa was suspended for the time being, according to BNT the B-probe should have already been positive.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borissow immediately responded with criticism of the athlete.
"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said, "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have been excluded."
For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doping-blasted nation must not participate in Rio.
On Friday the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positively three days earlier like his brother Tomasz on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.
Both contest the intake, but both are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg.
Before the launch of the athletes, the Danekowa case is particularly a major blow for the reputation of the entire sport.
The World Federation IAAF had prevented the entire Russian team from starting until an exception due to systematic dopings, including the lions' movement Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio.
In swimming, the previous crimes in China had also caused violent conflicts between the athletes.
So the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang Harsh.
"Sun Yang Pinkelt purple."
"When I see the podium over 200 m freestyle, I want to surrender," Lacourt said on the French radio.
Sun was also at the heart of an argument with the Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and no respect for doping wrongdoers," he said.
Sun had been tested positively on the Trimetazidine Stimulan in 2014 at the Chinese Championships, but only had to sit off a three-month lock.
Datenklau: As perfide, hackers blackmail their ransom
Developers of extortion malware attack currently targeted companies - and are successful.
According to a current survey of malware defense specialists malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed have been at least once in the past 12 months, partially victims of an attack with blackmail software.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of the companies were once targeted for Ransomware extortion.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransoms demanded by the perpetrators in order to re-use the affected systems and data.
The perpetrators specialize their extortion software according to the observations of malwarebytes on attacks in company networks.
If they are successful there, the potentially extorting ransom is significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently watching an alarmingly fast evolution of the malicious software," explains Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world".
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertisements.
Then the perpetrators discovered extortion software for themselves.
Only private users were the goal, but the switch to corporate attacks has taken place horrifyingly quickly in recent months.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: Once active on the computer of a victim, it searches specifically for recently modified files such as word, Excel or database files as well as for archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the Ransomware and delete the originals sustainably.
The software then presents the demands of the extortioners.
In order to get the encryption code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of bitcoin cryptocurrency.
However, where private users are at risk of the personal photo database, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production is stopped.
Therefore higher the damage will occur when a Ransomware strikes.
22 percent of the German companies concerned reported loss of revenue from Ransomware, 13 percent even had to stop business completely, in one case people were at risk of life.
In Germany, many hospitals were already victims of attacks, whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.
"We always say to the victims, "Don't pay, you only promote the problem," explains Kleczynski.
However, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay get their data back.
For managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators given the downtime in the operation.
The hackers, in turn, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure security researchers have investigated the user interfaces and contact with the blackmailers and come to the result: The perpetrators are actually trying to build up a kind of customer service to take more money.
They explain to their victims via chat how they can pay by bitcoin, set up free-access support websites or decrypt free of charge example files.
And if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively riskless profits of Ransomware extortion, the hackers are becoming more and more professional and share the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski of the antivirus provider Sophos: "An individual person can write a Ransomware approximately within a week."
It is more likely, however, that these are three or four persons.
The programmers then sell their malicious software to the actual extortioners in the form of a software builder.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.
"In the scope of delivery is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearances and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The extortioners then seek further hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service industry.
So you log into one of the forums in the underground, buys the set from a criminal and commissions another one to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
The payment is made per infected computer.
"The criminals usually then order spammers to spread," explains Wisniewski.
The risk of Ransomware is now known to many companies that better secure their data.
Over 50 percent of company IT managers in the malwarebytes survey trust to be able to prevent Ransomware using file backups and scanner software.
As a result, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
"If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful digestion, the perpetrators are threatening the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski.
Thus, depending on the type of data, the damage potential is still much higher than before.
In future, the perpetrators could also take on board completely new goals on the Internet of Things.
At the hacker conference Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how to get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, the release of such a blocked heater could be worth a ransom to some victims.
If the perpetrators then block a whole production road in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and everyday
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.
The HR-V, which has been designed on the same new platform as the new jazz, is actually proving extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the HR-V is only 1.60 m high rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the fund, it doesn't seem close at all.
The interior materials are well-processed and seem pleasant, only the cockpit top falls slightly there.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in storage space.
Not only is there a trunk of 453 l available at elevated and 1026 l with folded backrests, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: The back seat can be folded up like a cinema chair, thus offering storage space that is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.
The trunk can be well loaded, but the loading height at 650 mm is slightly higher than the corresponding Peugeot 2008.
The 1,6-l diesel tested with 88 kW/120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
He should, however, do a little less work.
The daily consumption is 4,7 l/100 km.
There is another motorization: a 1.5 l gasoline with 96 kW/130 hp.
An all-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
However, the steering should be a little more direct.
The equipment leaves no wishes in the tested top variant "Executive".
Safety systems include the City Emergency Brake Assist (Trop 32), the collision warning system and the track retention assistant.
The collision warner is sometimes annoyed because when he ranked many obstacles as "coming objects".
The remote light assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent speed controller responds to the traffic signs and threatens the speed as needed.
The full connectivity, however, is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI socket are under the armrest and are therefore a little cumbersome to achieve.
The approximately 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are all right.
If you don't want to invest so much, you'll get the gasoline from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro-6 exhaust standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not liable: fall on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the overthrow of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
The Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf (Az.: 18 U 124/14) argued that liability is only possible in the event of hazards typical of aviation.
The plaintiff had broken a kneecap at the fall.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it was a general risk of life, according to the court.
The airline didn't have to pay the man any compensation.
Sickness: When does the organizer pay?
Sick holidaymakers only get money back after their journey when the cause of the illness is undoubtedly found in the hotel.
But this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, on the second day of their Turkish leave, a family was severely affected by diarrhoea and vomiting.
She spent almost the entire vacation in the room.
Their illness led the vacationers back to a defective sewage treatment plant, which allegedly had polluted the seawater.
The family felt that the journey was thus defective - and complained against the organizer.
The plaintiffs had no success in court.
In fact, the sewage treatment plant was defective.
However, the organizer only learned of this shortly before the plaintiff left.
He had to assume that the seawater was okay.
So he has not violated his information obligations, according to the judgment.
No contaminations were found in the water samples.
The illness of several hotel guests - possibly through infection among themselves - is a general risk of life.
Of 691 guests only 38 were ill.
De Maizière said that after the acts of violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were concerned about further attacks.
The state had to be prudent and determined to respond to terrorist threats at the same time.
Our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not condone this triumph to the terrorists.
If criminals had to leave the country more quickly, this would increase security and strengthen the support of the people for refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to achieve implementation of the proposals until the 2017 Bundestag elections.
He also announced further personnel reinforcement of the security forces, "in the middle four-digit order over several years".
Sympathy advertising for terrorism had to be punished again.
Video surveillance is supposed to improve, arms law is being revised in such a way as to make it more difficult to purchase weapons on the Internet.
The last much discussed duty of silence for doctors is to be observed according to the words of de Maizière.
However, in dialogue with the medical profession, he wants to look for solutions to reduce the risk to citizens, he said with a view to, for example, mental disturbances.
In order to counteract radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers that better social care is necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumatized people.
To pursue criminals in specific areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizière plans to use hidden investigators.
SPD Chief Gabriel said, "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security."
It was important that the Minister of the Interior spoke out clearly against actionism.
"That was an earlash for the sharpeners in the CDU/CSU," said Gabriel to the newspapers of the Funke Mediengruppe (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union for a ban on Burka and the abolition of double nationality.
A general ban on full veiling is considered to be constitutionally problematic.
You can't forbid everything you refuse, and I refuse to carry the Burka.
Rules could be discussed, for example, in road traffic or in court for witnesses.
Green Chefin Simone Peter proposed to the Minister that he would simulate with ever new anti-terror packages the activity and capacity to act.
Left partner chief Bernd Riexinger said: "Flotty sayings and aggravation of the right of residence no longer bring security to the people in this country".
Better traffic flow on the motorway carrier
It regularly stands on the bypass road - here is a picture of November.
But this is to be changed: the right-hand turn-off track is to be extended.
This is a good news for all drivers who are standing in traffic on the surrounding road every evening in a traffic jam when they drive over the highway (A 43).
On Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August), the Landing of Road Construction extends the right turnaround by 700 metres between Hammer Straße and Weseler Straße.
Motorists can then thread directly from the Hammer Straße to the right.
The great advantage: the traffic splits up early, thus improving the overall run on the busy section of the federal road 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU-fraction in the districts representation Münster-West.
The roadway narrowing on the delivery system is especially annoying for drivers between 17 and 19 o'clock.
On workdays, the backstaw extends to the bridge over the Albersloher road and sometimes beyond.
Reason is the needle tube on the B 51 shortly before the exit Weseler Straße.
From here the traffic is only routed in an intrusive direction over the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt well four quarters years ago.
The reason: Static calculations had revealed that the bridge no longer had the required carrying capacity to take two-track, in particular, heavy load traffic.
How long this congestion and the associated day-to-day stamina will last cannot be said by the responsible country holding.
However, years can be expected: The bridge has an official remaining service until 2034.
For the extension of the right bending track, the country company has consciously chosen the less traffic time in the school holidays because disability is expected.
The traffic is occasionally passed by the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Intercultural Travel: Cultural Offers for Schools
The international class of the forest school attended the play "The Invisible House".
The association Nima's and the Young Theater are now planning a music project.
The Nima's Association allows young people with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has visited a performance of the award-winning piece "The Invisible House" of the Young Theater Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Journey" initiated by Nima's association, 19 students between the ages of 11 and 15 visited the production in the small house.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the goal of cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster within the framework of this project.
Most of the class's young people came to Münster from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria between September 2015 and March 2016 and speak little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic images and video animations, they were still able to follow the course of action, says the press release of the Young Theater Münster.
The association Nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Talgel, and the Young Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without escape and migration backgrounds between 14 and 20 years of age should be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing, dance, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language mediation are planned.
The project "Intercultural Journey" continues.
In view of the increase in refugee numbers, the association expects to participate with many classes.
Rain instead of star mounds: hope for weather improvement
The weather has made the star-scrapers in southwestern Germany a strike in the bill at night to Friday - but there is still hope.
The night was bad because of clouds and rain for watching the sky spectacle, said the chairman of the Observatory Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on Saturday night.
The weather is supposed to be good, so we'll see a lot of star snooping in the sky.
The star scales are Persians, which are among the fastest star screws at 26,000 kilometers per hour.
They have their names because they seem to come from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Relaxing Night: Tips for Sleep Disorders
In the evening you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning it is far before the alarm bell no longer to think of sleep.
It's anything but relaxing.
After all, you have such problems in good company: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently than not relaxing.
What do sleeping problems or sleep disorders say?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes underlying them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, board member of the German Association for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What one understands by land, however, is the insomnia, i.e. a sleep disorder.
Many people feel that sleep is unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, a member of the board of directors of the German House Medical Association with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.
What's wrong with sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Behind it can include organic, mental or behavioural factors, but also medications.
Sleep disorder is not uncommonly the expression of another disease.
"Very early awakening is common especially with depression," says Weess.
And it can be that different factors depend on each other.
For example, if you have a disc attack, you may find it bad, wakes up every two to three hours, and you may start grumbling about everyday problems and care, then Weeß gives you an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
From when should you have trouble sleeping with your doctor?
Anyone who does not sleep well in at least three nights a week for a period of one month and is impaired on the day should go to the doctor, advises weeds.
The impairment may look quite different: one is depressed, tired, unsleep, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical disorders such as stomach or headache.
In order to alleviate sleep disorders, it is important to find out their causes.
Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or medications - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.
Lowered sleep physicians are hardly available in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Sleep Medicine Center of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
Therefore, in case of sleeping problems one should first turn to the home doctor, counsels Weess.
It can explain with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who was supposed to go to the dormitory, and what's going on?
For example, doctors advise on snoring with atemoustzern, in case of day fatigue, in sleepwalkers, or if you do not find the cause of sleep disorder, says Fietze.
You really don't have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
"Just don't sleep at lunch," says Fietze.
After cabling you go to bed at his normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, you wear a noseglass, a chest strap and a sensor on your finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping end.
How can those affected deal with the problems?
There are quite a lot of screws that can be used for better sleep.
Weeß counts on: Regular bedtime and bedtime, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not avoid watching alcohol for sleep, and do not watch the clock at night - then you start to count immediately, and that is absolutely not beneficial.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
The former German swimmer Markus Deibler spoke on Facebook to disappoint the DSV team at Olympia.
In December 2014, he made his first gold debut at the Short Track World Championships in Doha and at the same time made his first world record.
Now the former DSV-Athlet Markus Deibler has made himself protective via Facebook from his former teammates in criticism.
"In a country where an Olympic champion receives a prize of 20,000€ and a jungle king of 150,000€ nobody should wonder about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday.
The conveying system in swimming was bad, but the doping controls were very good.
We cannot thus compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look or even operate so closely on the subject of doping.
"I'm not saying that controls should be suspended here," he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler had to be reported already nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
That's the way it should be done with countries.
"If it is not possible to control WADA/FINA from a certain time before the World Cup/OS by independent controllers, it is not allowed to take part," the hamburger, who is now running an ice floor, asks.
Airport: Baggage robberies arrested
Professional Diebe at Düsseldorf Airport
On Thursday, two women and two men between the ages of 50 and 61 were arrested by the Düsseldorf police.
As gangs, the suspects had committed several bag and luggage thefts.
At 9:30 p.m., civil officials in the Düsseldorf Airport recognized a band known to police officers from past theft officials.
The two women and two men had committed several crimes since mid-July of this year and were committed jointly, part-time and particularly professional.
The specialists of the Criminal Commissariat 34 can prove four acts to the thieves, who have come to Germany specifically for the purpose of committing crimes.
They had captured a total of over 15,000 euros.
Altbauten, a few Lindenbäumchen, in between: Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain doesn't seem that way at first sight, but the police are among the "dangerous places" of the city.
If you walk the road from east to west, you pass playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a bio shop.
Someone sprayed at the facade of a grey house.
In contrast to a Lidl, which will soon be demolished, is already being built: by 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be built here.
In recent weeks, however, articles on this "trouble district", as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, are best illustrated with burning cars.
Reason is the house with number 94: Once occupied, the residents now have rental contracts, but on the ground floor are still occupied spaces and are used for events.
Since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin interior senator Henkel had several times declared himself to be a tough course by the police against the project, calling the area "No-Go-Zone" for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
After the rooms on the ground floor, the Katterschmiede, had been evacuated with 300 police officers on June 22, the police patrolled official statements for three weeks that, according to 30 to 40 officials and three local crew cars, blocked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94.
Meanwhile, on behalf of the unknown owners, construction workers renovated the rooms.
On July 13th, a Berlin administrative court decided that the room had been illegal, and one day later, police and construction workers went off under the cheer of sympathizers and residents.
This summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk late.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.
Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in Kiez since 1999, and Jana*, who is raising three children here, are especially generous by the police presence.
With the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern about increasing rents and gentrification.
It doesn't sound like a Kiez who wanted to protect himself from vandalizing left.
The grave, which the Berlin interior senator and the police open between housekeepers and their neighbors, does not exist.
Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which today also has a low average income and high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
In 1990, numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied, including almost the whole of Mainzer Straße near the Rigas.
While the Mainzer had been cleared in a real street battle under a large police charge, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and are sometimes still occupied by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and voters from all over the world in recent years: with them, inhabitants of GDR times and former besetters are now sharing their Kiez.
This also makes sense with the rentals, which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 with new rentals.
Many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols for this development: they are recognized on thrown-in disks or freshly painted facades, which have been sprayed with coloured bags.
No other street was so often mentioned this year along with the words "left autonomous violence".
One reason why not all neighbors view this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: according to statistics, crimes such as body injury are almost exclusively against policemen.
Most of the crimes involve damage to property, which tend to meet the newly built and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rental house next to the controversial 94 years, there can be no uncertainty.
As far as violence is concerned, it is daunting: The people in 94 are their neighbors, who have certainly not been.
Also, the famous burning cars are no longer available directly in Riga.
For the studied architect her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere".
New builders are consciously pulled into Riga street - and remained.
That is why it was so important to her that the residents got back to their streets: from the police, politics and the media, all of which suddenly claimed the high level of interpretation over the district in July.
However, in the eyes of female residents such as Neugebauer, the road is still taken away: by sightless new buildings in former buildings that crowd out the old inhabitants.
"These are, in the end, condos that are not interesting for many people here - more people live here who are not so well subdued," she says.
"I absolutely cannot approve of violence and destruction."
But what do you do when you never listen to someone?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those attracted by colour bombs: The house projects and the left scene were part of Kiez.
Anyone who moves should be aware of it - just as someone who moves to a pub district can complain about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizer.
She is also a social worker on the ground.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee representative for Urbach.
The social teacher supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working group for refugee aid, administration, authorities and anyone else involved.
Regine's customer from the work group indicates that the honorary members are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the eggy wool milk sauce, which has a problem above all.
For example, some, less mocking than rather referring to the variety of tasks desired, meant that the administration wanted to sign the office.
An administrative skill was sought with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just an eggy wool milk sauce.
But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it is about organization, working with people on the ground and also behind the scenes and networking.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
It has a 50 per cent salary limited to three years.
"It was high time," says Regine Kunden, who supports Annika Deuschle's honor and main actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
Soon new containers will be standing in the water road
It has been a serious problem for some time to find homes for the refugees who have been recognized.
The municipalities are responsible for connecting accommodation.
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented homes.
The costs of construction, rental or renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility shifts from the Landratsamt to the municipality and job centre.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time now.
De facto the administration does not find private apartments.
It doesn't work until now, depending on private homes, says Deuschle.
Therefore, communal apartments need to be dried up, as it is so beautiful.
So soon new containers will be set up in the water road.
But it is not done only with apartments.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a permanent stay, there are traineeships, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and assistance for refugees and migrants who need to be found or set up.
"More places would be good," says Regine customer.
Many work in the building yard or help housekeepers, do charitable work - and this is motivated and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.
It hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect.
That's "no employment therapy."
Activity, however, does not mean just work.
The day needs a firm structure, say "Deuschle" and "Customer".
People need to develop a sense of belonging.
So it takes offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.
Professional courses are nice.
So here too, administrative and honorary jump in.
It was central that the refugees were given the feeling that they were wanted and welcomed in Germany.
The long duration of the procedures was a problem.
They have to explain to the refugees that it takes time and that they can usefully bridge the time, for example with language courses.
Those who at some point develop the feeling that he cannot help anyone in Urbach, should not work and be useless, will never integrate.
The clear majority was motivated.
But there are also problems, says customer honestly, "people who don't have anything to do with it." The work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.
It's all a "mummy task."
A difficult question: are the two afraid of radicalisation after the recent incidents, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regine customer quite clearly, "what some might call naive." A residual risk can and does not want to exclude them.
However, the helpers are already sensitized.
These incidents were also the subject of refugees.
They'd be afraid that the assassins would exterminate her completely.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Kunden.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
Therefore, chief and honorary officials must look out for activities on the ground and in the region.
They always have the background that soon a new bump of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.
Does Germany need an upper limit?
To answer this question clearly, politics is shirking.
Actually, it's unfair to put them on the spot.
"We haven't arrived in Urbach where we were able to go," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees would relax the situation.
Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already used to integrate the people of the past reasonably.
These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, they must be helped, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complicated, as there are no simple answers.
Schorndorf: Intruders searched with helicopter
The police chopper flew from different areas for about an hour - unsuccessfully.
Two unknown men were forced into an apartment in a multifamily house in Lindenweg on Friday morning around 8.50 a.m.
The inhabitants surprised the two, and they took refuge.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, probably masked, both wore bluejeans and black hoodows.
They fled to the city center.
The police used several strip crews as well as a police chopper.
The flag went off without success.
Anytime before the act, the unknown fell close to the apartment or on its escape.
Baden-Württemberg: Police determined after Rocker attack on imbiss
