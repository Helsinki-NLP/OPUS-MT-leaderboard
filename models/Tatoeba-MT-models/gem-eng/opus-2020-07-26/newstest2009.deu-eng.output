The Prague Stock Exchange collapses into the bottom of the line of business.
After the steep waste in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
The transactions with the shares of ČEZ reached almost half of the normal daily business.
The Prague Stock Exchange opened at the beginning of Tuesday's business from Monday when it dropped by another six percentage points.
This time the ground lay for the break-in on Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic, too, the reaction of the market to the result of the American House of Representatives' vote, which had refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
Cases of shares in Asia
A dramatic case on Tuesday experienced the shares on the exchanges in Asia, although the indices were able to offset some of the losses during the day.
The index of Hang Seng Stock Exchange in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points during the business day, but was able to settle some of the losses later, reducing the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The index of Seng China Enterprises, which observed the movement of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
The stock on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but then the losses decreased to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange decreased by 3.6 percent according to the index.
"The timing for the rescue operation in the United States is uncertain and will affect the financial markets worldwide," said the chief of the monetary authority in Hong Kong Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although it belongs to China, determines its monetary policy itself, regardless of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are moving at the same level as those in the United States.
According to the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, the US legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and adopt the draft for support of the financial system.
Otherwise, further countries would be threatened with the collapse.
American Shares Bloodbath
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the plan for support of the financial system, for which up to 700 billion dollars (almost 12 trillion Kč) should be spent.
The legislators thus ignored the invitation of President George Bush to support the plan.
In Bush's view, the plan would regulate the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and thus help stabilise the entire economy.
The American shares experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and the main stock indices recorded the biggest collapse in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index dropped by almost seven percent, and he had recorded a similar break last in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there were hardly any indications that the draft would not get through in the House of Deputies, the index experienced a free fall.
Congress admits: US government can pump 700 billion dollars into the banks
The top representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of agreement on financial assistance for the American financial system.
The vote will take place at the beginning of next week.
The US legislators made a breakthrough in talks about the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a financial assistance to the American financial system of 700 billion dollars (about 12 trillion crowns).
However, this does not mean a victory.
In fact, Congressmen still have to negotiate some details of the agreement before they can publish and vote on the final version of the law.
The financial support plan will be negotiated on Monday at the American Congress.
On Sunday, the chairman of the Banking and Financial Services Committee said that Barney Frank was the Reuters Agency.
According to the Senate, different information could probably be voted on the plan at the earliest on Wednesday.
According to economists, a Communication on the adoption of the plan should be the first significant psychological factor for a revival of financial markets.
After that, however, there will be a "enlightenment" due to the complicated mechanisms, how to help markets also in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have explained our different views on what a package should look like to stabilise the market," said Democracy Nancy Pelosi to the Bloomberg agency.
According to your words, there could still be a final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislator met on Sunday with American finance minister Henry Paulson to give the government fund its final form.
This provides for the purchase of unsaleable mortgage assets by the financial corporations, which plunge financial corporations into severe losses and jeopardise the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of a definite agreement on a plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market.
You have to continue the recovery plan even further, but I think we are on target," says Paulson.
A Signal for Asia Businesses
The global financial crisis is also falling sharply in the stock markets.
According to the words of the Democratic Senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators have tried to reach a final agreement before Sunday.
This means that investors should be reassured about the Asian financial markets that lie in the first time zone where a congress decision could affect business on Monday.
So far, however, it is not quite clear when both Chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, nor is there any doubt as to whether the negotiations could fail at the last minute.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the next few days.
However, the law will have some changes.
The total amount for assistance for the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial 350 billion dollars should be made available as soon as possible as President Bush demanded.
The congress can, however, block the disbursement of the remaining money if it has the impression that the program does not fulfil its function, with another 100 billion dollars and later the final 350 billion dollars.
Bush is making positive progress in negotiations
Although the President has a veto right in this decision, Congress can vote in favour of veto.
Despite these changes, however, the programme's basic idea has remained based on obtaining finance for the purchase of poor mortgage securities whose value has fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, the Senate then on Monday", says Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The American President Bush was also satisfied with the progress made.
His spokesperson Tony Fratto said that Bush was satisfied with the progress made on Saturday and "estimate both sides' efforts to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy".
Restriction of golden parachutes
The Chairman of the Banking Committee of Senate Christopher Dodd, the lead negotiator, was told that the legislators had agreed on responsibility for the financial programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the conclusion of discounts and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law is also intended to limit the so-called golden parachutes for the directors of the companies involved in the programme and to establish a committee to supervise the fund.
This is to be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this and achieved great progress towards an agreement that works and is important to the market and to all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also expects help for homeowners who have problems with paying back their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates with mortgages it buys, with the aim of reducing the monthly costs for debtors and enabling them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological Assistance
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to the main economist of Patria Finance David Marek, but the implementation will be very difficult.
"And that's because you don't know by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets are bought up.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government divide the losses," Marek said to the server iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan is adopted now or at the beginning of next week, Marek does not consider it decisive.
"It is very important that Congressmen agree to support the plan and that they adopt it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement that it will be adopted is the most important thing at this moment," Marek stressed.
Duel on Messer's cutting: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We advise you on your choice
While almost every phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can still call.
That's why, of course, it looks better just to buy a phone.
In spite of all, there are enough reasons why you should become an independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims of the future owners.
Sure, you can hardly buy yourself a great expensive record player at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
Once such musical novelties do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this.
However, if you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues in the shelf, you probably dream of at least one of them.
This is also the case with music travelling, i.e. with compressed music, simplified - music in MP3 format.
Here too there are price and quality categories.
For one, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, but a Pink-Floyd fan will probably hard-core headphone for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is wide.
Battery life is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what mobile phones can do, they don't even make sense.
No modern device should be used as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, telephoneing and simsing, it can play music and videos, record both, it has a better one, sometimes a worse camera and may also be able to navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communicators, you almost have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no fridge can grill and no TV photograph.
But the universality of mobile phones also brings disadvantages.
The more features you use on your mobile phone, the more often you will need to recharge it.
And playing music is one of the greatest energy eaters.
Only a few mobile phones can play music for more than ten-twelve hours, most of the time it is much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest) are significantly more powerful.
That's why you should expect cheap cell phones not to be able to play more than a few hours of music.
If you call from time to time, you would prefer to buy a charger for your office for sure - this also applies to more expensive equipment.
With MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the less good ones will last at least 9 hours uninterrupted operation with one charge.
There is another problem when you want to play the music over to the phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices have a USB port, and not every phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can play the music directly to a storage medium, but only a few card readers will be finished without any reduction with the tiny memory cards that are used in mobile phones.
No special software is required for players except for exceptions (iPod).
You just need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most mobile phones and players themselves set up a music library, ordered by the name of the performer, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the user rating.
Some devices form only the tree structure of the address directory, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can do more
When selecting a specific device, you should in particular check out the life of the battery, the storage capacity, the quality and type of sound and, of course, also the ease of use.
Is music mainly for you and listen to them every day just for example in the tram, then a sufficient number of mobile phones that play MP3 files.
Which really can almost any cell phone.
You also don't have to control which music formats a mobile phone or a player can process.
MP3 create all, and most of the music you get will be in this format right now.
The format is one of the most common, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better mobile phones also enable the purchase of music online.
You only need to access the corresponding pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile Internet, and you can already purchase a song or album.
This service can be a striking argument in itself for why one should put on a musical handicraft.
Unfortunately, the provider's offer is poor and usually limited only to fast radio hits.
Prices are not the lowest either.
In general, however, it is assumed that this kind of music sales (see it via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
The cell phone carries most of it.
If you want to listen to something, grab the phone in the jacket pocket while the player forgets at home.
It depends, however, whether you always wear headphones or at least a wireless freephone.
If not, you can access the integrated speaker with almost any phone, but only the least MP3 player.
The biggest advantage of the music handicrafts will probably be in the price for many.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you already get a decent walkman.
The biggest handicap will be for most that no normal headphones are present.
The best and most technically developed phones with a 3.5 mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
In turn, the advantage of the player lies in easy operation.
The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - player can really use anyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity of operation with the previous normal cassette recorder or, for example, the record player is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of an improperly employed mobile Internet and a subsequent horrifying bill for data transmissions.
Which device should be used now
Also the cheapest phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for replaceable storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, you will have enough two thousand crowns.
But respect.
For base models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are usually supported.
Only the most expensive can also read 8-GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, then grab Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to place more than 1100 crowns on the table.
Be one of the more demanding listeners, rather take specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have self-contained controls for MP3, and the ease of use is thus the same as a single MP3 player.
The most common is Sony Ericsson, whose mobile phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 players.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand kroner, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) provide you with MP3 players from the above manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is already coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech providers offer virtually all services, as they are offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, there is something missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classic at lower prices.
Perhaps this one will not be kept waiting for long.
That the Czech mobile service providers work at the most expensive in Europe at all, we have often reported on Mobil.cz.
This also confirmed the telecommunications authority ČTÚ, which pointed out that the price for a text message here is higher than in the rest of the European Union.
Following the last steps of the European Commission in the regulation of roaming charges, it is likely that there will be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of the Czech mobile service providers SMS will be cheaper from abroad than at home.
How is it that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that really makes a fight.
Maybe it sounds paradoxical, in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of well over 100%.
However, mobile telephone providers are happy to complain that there is an extremely high level of competition on the Czech market.
This is often also the responsibility of the Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák, who had often stated in the past that there was no place for another supplier in the Czech Republic.
It is likely that a classic provider with its own network will no longer have a lot of opportunities (by the way, he would probably not find any frequencies).
But there is one other option - a virtual provider.
The entry of virtual providers into the mobile market brought with it a significant price reduction, which the classic mobile service providers had to react to.
There were similar votes to those in the Czech Republic before such companies as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the UK market.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can really be successful.
By the way, you don't need to look for examples for a long time.
In February of this we reported on the start of the virtual provider mobilizing in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider managed to win more than 100 thousand customers and thus rise to the fifth largest provider in the country.
The financial group Penta, which owns, among other things, U:fon in the Czech Republic, is behind mobilisation.
The advantage of virtual providers is that one can focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need far less customers than a classic provider.
They do not need a relatively high cost for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, the virtual providers usually profile themselves as low-cost companies - they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less extensive service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of mobilization in Poland shows, it can also be a good move to focus on a non-clarifying target group.
This provider is specifically aimed at men.
"Echte Kerle wählen Mobilking - the provider they like and trust," said David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator company of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept could be adopted in the Czech Republic as in Poland.
The press spokesperson of Vodafone Miroslav Čepický also doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the provision of services."
In the Czech Republic, the mobile service providers mean without a chance
However, it is almost certain that when a virtual mobile service provider conquers Czech Republic, this will not be mobilisation.
"We speak of an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look particularly hopeful.
Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, the press spokesperson of the financial group Penta, says in a telephone call for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková in other countries of our region.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the current mobile service providers in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to do so.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything in their power to ensure that no potential competitor is created.
For a long time, your interest in launching a virtual mobile service provider has been showing the GTS Novera group, which wants to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed network, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the earlier, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile service providers.
With some of them we have already been able to reach negotiations," said the press spokesperson of Pavel Kaidl.
Maybe now's a better time.
Unofficial information indicates that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
But so far this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
"At this moment, we do not assume that there is room for a full virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market has large specificities in relation to other markets.
So far, no subject has addressed us with a complex and serious project in this area," says his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň from the Press Department of Telefónica O2.
Other suppliers also point to the specificity of the Czech market.
The press spokesperson at T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds, in rare agreement with the O2 statement: "Up to now, we have not found a viable and mutually beneficial project on which to build further."
And she adds: "The network of T-Mobile will hardly show up a virtual provider until the end of the year.
At that moment we should already have a concrete offer to be able to think so in the short term."
Vodafone focuses its attention more on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický comments: "For negotiations with potential virtual providers, we are open, especially in the area of cost and infrastructure sharing.
This is exactly what we consider to be the best from the point of view of customers.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area lies in the search for a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile Internet."
The responsible authorities - with the providers hand in hand
It is easy to understand the behaviour of mobile operators, another provider was called more competition, this would lead to falling prices and thus also to a decrease in profits.
Why, then, should such a competitor be facilitated to enter the market?
The fact that providers can draw on a string when it comes to something also proves the long way to and fro about the emergence of U:fon.
Probably the strongest pressure towards ČTÚ was out of the company T-Mobile at the time when U:fon came to market.
This is also evidenced by the information available to the public from the ČTÚ websites.
But now U:fon is right to argue why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová commented: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently also been strengthened by the entry of a fourth mobile service provider.
Taking into account the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that a new player in the market itself and in particular its services would impose high requirements."
However, in view of this approach by mobile operators, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is astounded.
This is not just the attitude of the ČTÚ, which unfortunately, unlike the United Kingdom and other highly developed countries, does not have the competence to intervene in economic competition.
It has exclusively the office to protect economic competition (ÚOHS).
But this refers to the whole problem of his very typical attitude.
"The market entry of a virtual mobile service provider would then be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile service provider and a virtual provider through the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such agreement has been concluded, as the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classic providers," said Kristianan Chalupa in his reply to our request from the ÚOHS External Relations Department.
Representatives of the providers would not be surprised at such a wording.
This is more than a concern of a public authority representing consumer interests and, among other things, of ensuring that no one abuses its position on the market.
In particular, if Kristianán Chalupa adds: "In other countries, where virtual providers work normally, it can be observed that their entry into the market has contributed to a price reduction in mobile telephone services."
But probably the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price reduction are not part of the interests of ÚOHS.
Really shocking in this case is the almost touching consistency of the three mobile service providers resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence is on hand.
Just as the very same price of petrol at the gas stations is certainly only coincidence and the result of a tough competition.
"In this case, the Authority has not identified any signs of anti-competitive action and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way in the matter.
None of the suppliers has a dominant market position, so it does not have the corresponding increased responsibility for its market operations.
The necessary instruments for opening up the mobile market to virtual providers are probably also missing from the telecommunications regulator," said Chalupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many contentious points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, developed by the ČTÚ, after which telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
Of course, none of the Czech mobile service providers have a dominant position in such a market.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different view - the consent of the network operator is always necessary for the market entry of a virtual provider.
And the mobile service provider has - logically - the monopoly for its network.
This means that he necessarily takes a dominant position in a particular segment.
However, even if you do not agree with this argument, it should at least be a warning for the ÚOHS that three mobile service providers behave in strikingly similar ways.
Complaints by a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) demonstrate that they face very similar obstacles during negotiations with all suppliers.
The shifting of responsibility to the ČTÚ is then a common trick in telecommunications services, with which the ÚOHS distances itself from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recently adopted amendment of the Telecommunications Act did not implement the extension of the ČTÚ's competences to the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS must know this all too well, but probably they have other interests.
It's okay when no one's looking.
Without notice, the operation of any pseudo-virtual provider, of whom there are several in the Czech mobile networks.
They are companies that publish their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but which are only partially public.
They are usually companies operating in the multi-level marketing sector.
Personal mobile phone services offer, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach the chosen ones.
The joke is that the company acts as a classic business customer to the operator, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, it then receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile telecommunications providers prohibit similar types of resale.
"If there are cases that you describe, then it can be a violation of the contractual terms with which we will then deal, which may lead to the termination of cooperation with the corresponding society," Martina Kemrová answered our question about this problem.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing does not apply to the operators responsible for mobile communications.
In particular, in the case of the three mentioned companies, it may be thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such action.
In fact, the activities of these companies do not lead to negligible profits, while, unlike the actual virtual providers, they are not affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický draws attention to possible problems: "The law allows such kinds of speculation, despite everything, the services of these companies are used only by a very small percentage of customers.
They also have to accept that the SIM card in their phone does not run on their name, so they cannot have full control over it as the normal customers of the mobile service providers."
However, the ČTÚ would have to be at least strange.
There is also another question for the ÚOHS.
Before such a procedure, mobile operators close their eyes, why lock themselves against a virtual provider?
It is to be added that the ÚOHS has quite strong competences to discover such activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to satisfy itself with the declaration of the providers, they knew nothing about it and their terms and conditions would forbid it.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As the text has been pointed out several times, the market entry of virtual providers led to a significant price decline in the various services.
In practice, in all countries where virtual providers have emerged, classic providers have tried to prevent their emergence virtually more or less.
The arguments they used were practically identical - a market too small or too saturated, problems in the quality of services, etc.
In the developed countries, however, the regulatory bodies, which did not attempt to protect the interests of mobile communications providers, but which were trying to protect their customers, intervened in precisely these moments.
If it was through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator arose, and this followed further.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies reject themselves as a hot potato all the time.
Based on our experience, we cannot dismiss the impression that in these cases ignorance in competences is more than favorable.
But let's not throw the flint into the grain.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider is soon emerging, the Czech mobile market may soon be moving again.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile service provider, the ÚOHS will not remain ineffective when it comes to rejecting (discriminating) other stakeholders.
And the Czechs will not finally call more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymn has four new versions.
Find the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem Where is my home country on the occasion of the day of the Czech statehood.
The hymn was re-recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo song, in choir version and in an instrumental version.
Kateřina took over Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The users of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
Earlier he had told the Czech Radio that he had chosen singers with young, representative voices for the solo variants, which are distinctive and popular.
"From the beginning, I tried to keep a clear division at both ends and then also with the choir, so that one understands the text well so that a consensus can be established," said the conductor.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov můj was first heard in 1834 on the stage of the Standetheater in the original Czech piece Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music came from František Škroup.
It became popular, and people spontaneously accepted it.
The first verse of the song then became an organic component of the national anthem after the Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven symbols of the state remained after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
Who sounds the "new" hymn
The Prague transport companies will also transport on a chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday, 1 October 2008, will enter the history of Prague's transport companies as a date on which the first passengers will enter a subway, tram or bus, carrying an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
These people are currently able to buy about one hundred thousand people who own the open card.
The passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day or one-year coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and record it at the same time on their chipcard, in the Info Centres and branches of the transport companies at the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons have been available since yesterday via the Internet on the websites of the transport companies www.dpp.cz.
The service was used until the afternoon by over four hundred customers.
Those who use Internet sales can really forget the output window in the subway stations, where they had to wait regularly for their paper tickets in long queues.
You buy the coupon via the Internet, it is played on the Opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"At these places a switch with trained staff is also available to travellers, advises the interested person when buying the Internet and also records the coupon on the map," says the speaker of the project Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the libraries, electronic coupons can also be played on self-service vending machines on the Opencard, which are fitted in some subwayVestibüls.
What do such machines look like?
They are red, remembering the driver's rating, the passengers may have noticed them already in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but it should be 80 by the end of the year," Opatrný adds.
The coupon controls an automatic machine instead of the driver
The operation of the machines that will work tomorrow is easy.
Only the chip card has to be inserted, and the previously purchased coupon is recorded by itself.
The electronic coupons will apply from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
So on the suburban trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which the inhabitants of the townships of the Mittelboemen go to the capital.
"In the trains that are part of Prague's integrated traffic, the train attendants have reading devices that allow them to check the validity of the coupons according to time and zone," explains Filip Drápal of the organisation Ropid. This organisation compiles the timetables for Prague's traffic operations.
The suburban buses have ticket readers at the driver's desk.
When boarding, the chip card must not only be presented at the driver, but the open card must be placed at a marked place at the side of the checkout.
The driver thus controls the validity of the recorded coupons.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the played coupons, nothing is easier than the driver asking for this information," says Drápal.
A passenger who does not drive with suburban buses and no longer knows when the validity of the coupon ends can in turn go to the self-service vending machines where the coupons are played on the card.
Here the information about the validity of his documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudeten demanded a referendum from the United States
In 1945 the Sudeten Germans had sought the annexation of the Bohemian Forest to the United States.
This is evidenced by a letter stored in the collections of the Southern Bohemian scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With such a wish, in 1945 some groups of Sudeten Germans should have turned to the US presidents.
This is reflected, among other things, in a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and is retained today in the collections of the Southern Bohemian scientific library.
The Germans of Krumau ask the American president in the letter that he should not allow the return of the "Sudetengaus" - which was taken on the basis of the Munich agreement of Hitler - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and we really want to be sure that the American units enter the German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," says a letter signed with the words "People who are at the heart of the fate of the Sudeten."
Since the connection to Czechoslovakia makes Sudeten-German - in the knowledge of the Czech national character - presumed that it would expect brutality, carelessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take over protection over the Bohemian Forest for today and forever.
"We cannot believe that without regard to the view of a quarter-million inhabitants of this area, you are addressing a state foreign to us, which is suppressing and eliminating minorities and has done nothing at all to help the victory of the Allies," is to be read in the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is allegedly the fear of revenge on the "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States had doubts about the attitude of the Bohemian Forest Germans, it would be sufficient if he were to initiate a referendum in the Bohemian Forestgau on whether the inhabitants wanted to become part of the United States or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter in today's knowledge of post-war history may sound somewhat naive, he does, in the opinion of some witnesses of the time, draw a good picture of the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time.
Although the Bohemian Germans at least had to imagine that they would negotiate their deportation from the Republic, only a few of them agreed on such a possibility at all.
Some waited for the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Again, others thought they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
It is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
He was used in the war as Budweiser Deutscher at the Navy on the Baltic Sea.
When he came to British captivity at the end of the war and was taken to a prisoner camp in Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him, and he was to teach them Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, the Czech would pass them," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war believed that he would be expelled from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
Don't you think - then pay!
An emotional campaign is aimed at drivers
The most expensive action on security on the streets in Czech history.
The emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport wants to launch on Wednesday, could also be characterised.
The authority of Minister Aleš
The 150 million crown campaign will run on television, on radio, in cinema, on the Internet, but also on flyers.
It is intended to reduce drivers from driving too fast and alcohol at the wheel.
And they also remember to ride before taking a ride.
The campaign wants to raise the awareness of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, not least, professional drivers.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
The "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign also testifies to this:
Don't you think - then pay!
The words "do not think" are in capital letters on a label.
And then the word "pay" is in a blood smile.
This should mean that you can pay for a moment of inattentiveness with your own life.
The spots will be "stoken" the spectators by 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can see quite normal images with drastic photographs of victims of accidents.
It is a promise that the number of accidents and the number of deaths on the Czech roads will fall.
The spots were compiled by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Sugar bread and whips for motorists
"The motto for the driver is sugar bread and whip.
Sugar bread means that when they ride red, for example, they save time.
The whip is then the threat of punishment or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," said the traffic psychologist at Na Homolce Martin Kořán Hospital.
That is why information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising are necessary, says the psychologist.
Even less effective is in his view the fact that drivers draw attention to a danger.
"If you set up a static board warning of a danger, it will probably soon flow with the surrounding area, and the drivers will no longer see them," says Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The chairman of the provisional Israeli government, Ehud Olmert, has spoken out for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if peace with Palestine and Syria can be achieved in exchange.
He stressed this in an interview, which was printed on Monday by Jediot Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all," said Olmert to the newspaper.
"We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to resign to the Palestinians a similar percentage (Israeli territory) because there will be no peace without this," he added.
He admitted that a possible return would include Ostjerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and, above all, doesn't want tractors or bulldozers to roll over his legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to refrain from part of Jerusalem," Olmert remarked in charge of two attacks in the city in July, where several people were killed and dozens injured.
Following the words of the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "Special Solution for the Templars and Sacred and Historical Places" located in the territory of the Old Town.
"The one who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
That won't work," he continued.
Subtraction from the Golan Heights
Olmert advocated a withdrawal from the Golan Heights of Israel, which in his view is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require certain efforts on the part of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights," Olmert reiterated.
"The Syrians only know too well what they have to refrain from getting back the Golan hills.
They will have to refrain from their current relationship with Iran; they will have to refrain from their relationship with the (shinic) Hezbollah movement; they will have to refrain from the constant support they will have to give to the terrorism of the (shinic) Hamas movement, the Al-Khaida terror network and the jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister put into practice.
Questions about the accident: Are Stewards illegal on the bus?
The law doesn't know them, in a long-distance bus the bypass is not allowed
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus by the company Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question arises whether Stewards and travellers are allowed to walk and walk on the bus during the journey.
"If we want to comply strictly and formally with the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the Road Traffic Act," says the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident, which killed a twenty-two-year-old stewardess last week, was probably caused by the truck driver who crossed the road.
At this moment, the young woman sat at all costs next to the driver, on the least safe place in the car, although she had two more places at her disposal.
However, a bus can also have an accident or brake hard at the moment, where the Steward coffee or newspapers carry out.
It also plays a role in whether the bus is equipped to the vehicle letter after also with standing places.
If this is not on the bus, travellers must sit.
The distance buses of Student Agency have no standing places; what the director of the company, Radim Jančura, confirmed against Aktuálně.cz.
"We discussed this with the Ministry, and this initially did not agree with the movement of travellers.
Later on, this was taken back, and we reached a consensus that passengers may go to the toilet while driving, if they have their seat," he told his point of view.
The law doesn't know any stewards.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a steward - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is no legislation which prohibits the carrier from providing services.
The Road Traffic Act only knows the term vehicle attendants, but its rights and duties do not define it", adds the spokesman of the Ministry of Hanzelka.
The Director of the Road Vehicles Department of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný, on the other hand, believes that the law covers this issue afterwards.
"It depends on whether the bus has standing places in the product authorisation.
That's all," he emphasizes.
Buses are divided into city buses, where there are standing places and the maximum speed is limited, local buses with standing places and a higher permitted speed and long-distance buses without standing places with the highest speed and seats fitted with safety belts.
As in the airplane, says the expert
The BESIP transport safety expert Jaroslav Hořín sees no fundamental problem in the movement of Stewards on board a bus.
"In the case of a liquid route, there are not many dangers, the situation is comparable to the service on board an aircraft.
Also here is not sure when turbulence comes, and the Stewardess can hit his head."
"However, if a bus is broken, the laws of physics apply.
Just like in the city bus or in a tram.
The security of the Stewards must clarify the carrier through internal regulations," he says and also believes that this problem will not be solved completely from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to delete the services
Student Agency offers Stewards services as the only bus company.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The Director does not consider his/her profession to be risky after the accident.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the Steward's profession is risky, I will delete it.
Coffee and newspapers can get travellers on boarding.
That would also reduce costs," he says.
As an interest in security, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin justifies the lack of Stewards in his bus. However, his company operates only a fraction of lines compared to the Student Agency.
"We don't have stewardesses, on the other hand, we defend ourselves from the beginning.
Sooner or later, this will end with some fatal accident," he had not said quite a year ago for Týden.cz.
That was an incredible tragedy.
In the accident of a bus to Naples, a young stewardess from the Pilsen region was injured who had worked for two years for society.
The Slovenian truck was probably bent down without blinking from the stand strip and had blocked the bus's ride.
The driver of the bus tried to escape by a sharp manoeuvre, but collided with the right front with the truck.
Jančura argues that the two places were sold for the Stewards.
"These places cannot be reserved for remote connections, they are blocked."
Company wants to sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman's family, the agency will not wait for the court judgment, but a financial compensation awaits it from the debtor as well.
A change of law?
Not in sight
A more precise regulation of the movement of Stewards on board a bus could bring about a legal regime in which a thirty-member expert team of the Ministry of Transport already works for over a year.
"However, this has not yet come to a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the points system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones during the journey," Hořín said.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the Stewards to be a threat to the safety of travellers," says Hanzelka, controlling the safety of buses in the competence of police and occupational safety authorities.
Düsseldorf hopes rest on Frankfurt
In large words, the letter of the WestLB Board of Directors to the employees of the house is not missing.
By merging units of the Düsseldorf financial institution with the Frankfurt deka bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen financial group" could be created, it is said in the letter that became known on Monday.
The WestLB introduced a "competence block" with sustainable earnings in such a business.
And at all events, such a link could be the decisive stimulus to further groupings in the Landbank sector.
This is the case if a board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
The beaten WestLB is still under tremendous pressure.
Not only by the European Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Services Oversight Institute, which the North Rhine-Westphalian government recently made clear, the time needed to find a solution for the future.
However, the WestLB has been talking about a connection between the deka bank, which customers know about its investment funds, and the WestLB has been speaking for some time now - also on the Frankfurt side.
At the end of August, in a merger of the house on the Mainzer Landstraße with a state bank, such as the Helaba or the WestLB, Deka-Bank-Chief Franz Waas made a presentation of the half-year numbers.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, which is always held by the Landesbanken and the savings banks associations, has instructed the Management Board to conduct discussions with the WestLB on joint business activities.
It could be about the capital market business or parts of it.
The talks have, of course, just begun at the financial station.
From the deka bank, which is one of the more important employers at Frankfurt's financial centre with its 3000 employees, it is not the first time that we are talking about consolidation in the savings banks sector.
In 2003 it looked as if the deka bank could merge with the Landesbank Rhineland-Palatinate and the Helaba for a moment.
But there was nothing out of this trio.
The plans had hardly been made public, the Hessian government opposed the Helaba's participation in them.
The other two houses did not find one another.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Palatinate went instead to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, there have always been puzzles about a connection of the deka bank with Landesbanken.
However, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Management of Helaba, had recently spoken against plan games about getting together with his house.
Regardless of this, however, it seems to mature the realization that a collapse of the different houses of the public-law sector is in need.
After the election in Bavaria is over, BayernLB could first move closer to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
For the Helaba this is not necessarily good news.
Should the pressure rise to further mergers, you will gradually go out to the partners for it.
In the south, it would only be junior partners, although it has so far managed the financial crisis much better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
In turn, the Sparkassen and Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which participates in the Helaba at 85 percent, has pushed forward a lock at the beginning of the year.
At any rate, the North LB remained.
Such geostrategic considerations, however, are only the one side.
On the other hand, it is a question of how the different business models of individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl, the decisive question with which business model to ensure the future ability of the Landesbanks, had not yet been answered by the German savings bank and Giroverband.
In the end, there could also be a division of the West LB, which is, however, not desirable there for itself.
In this way, in the letter of the Management Board there is the talk, it will certainly seek a "total solution" for the house.
How this can be brought under a hat with the merger of individual units with the deka bank will still be shown.
The second meadow weekend is known as the "Italian Weekend".
For Elena it is the first, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is with him as his friend, and so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-liter beer barrel of the Kaiser brand, is a massively built peasant and proves to the about 200 October Fest ricers, what deep tones his throat can produce.
Elena gives Luca a kiss first, then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, the bus parking lot next to the Puorta Nuova station, will start at 23.45 this evening at four buses, "destinazione Monaco, fasta della birra", arriving probably at 6.30.
Three buses are mainly reserved for the Italians, in a bus travelling exclusively Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are already singing next to their flag, celebrating already at night.
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, that's nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with furzimitate lining and a glasses with wide silver irons, includes the buses.
For five years they have been going to the Oktoberfest, three tours this year alone.
At night, day after day on the meadow, at 10:30 p.m.
Staying overnight would only mean unnecessary spices, says Marco.
75 Euro costs the trip, the welcome roundabout with Kaiser-Beer, faithfully brewed the Bavarian clean-up service, the health insurance and the German-speaking guide - Marco has attended a language course in Frankfurt - including.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the Autostrada direction "Brennero".
There's no beer yet.
Soon it will be quiet on the bus, the travelers sleep.
Well, they'll still need their powers.
It is held in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where also several other buses with Italian marks on the motorway 8 shortly before Munich take another break.
When Marcos Group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at half past seven in the early hours, there are already 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a last speech, explains the plan of attack.
First, put on the yellow cap.
On the left is "Octoberfest", in Fraktur, next to the Internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggio.it".
Second: "When the doors get up to the beer tent, it's called running," Marco calls in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the places in the back part of the tent.
"Not at the front, otherwise we block, and not all yellow caps on the same benches spread in the room!"
The measure, roars Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget to drink.
"Safety men show us how to behave!
As soon as you leave, they'll be gone!"
Third, "Find out the point half-eleven today!" Do you understand?
And now it's for the meadow.
On the way, a yellow cap binds to the trees, to signs and even to the electoral plaque of a large Bavarian People's Party.
You want to be armed for the retreat.
It is the second weekend of the meadow, known as the "Italian Weekend".
There are no exact figures; the speech is of 50,000 who make their way across the Alps and enter the beer tents, ten percent of all visitors are supposed to have come from Italy on this weekend.
The Munich police force is reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteer helpers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which provides a national statistics in which the Italians take first place in front of the British (about 60 stakes) and Austrians (about 80) with about 200 medical supplies.
The Hofbruzelt is especially popular with Italians.
Sleepless nights for creditors of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system was relatively stable, and Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück only stressed last week.
How well that the politician used the word "relative" and even fought that the German banking sector is not spared from the crisis-like developments.
It has now arrived at the weekend.
The Munich real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE) listed in the Dax receives a billion-dollar credit from a consortium of German banks to shield themselves from the turbulence in the markets.
One person familiar with the situation said Reuters on Monday, the loan aid amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate only had to be mindful of the part it also uses.
The money comes from both private and public-law banks.
Background is losses with the daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report for long-term projects for which he has lent money, the public financier had refinanced himself extremely in the short term - which is no longer possible due to market mistrust.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserve had decreased by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity ratio had slightly increased from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current income and net income from financial operations had fallen to zero compared to the previous year's period, the income from subscriptions to receivables and certain securities as well as the liquidation of deposits in the credit business fell by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Due to higher revenues from reimbursement of subordinated settlement costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group, as well as from the reimbursement of interest on the basis of the tax rules and from the business services for group companies, the reduction in income had been moderated by around 16 percent.
The former state financier had initially speculated with commercial real estate loans after its privatisation in 1990, which had then been disaggregated into Aareal Bank.
Due to the lack of merit in traditional government funding, the Deppa had become more involved in infrastructure projects and the financing of Community projects by private investors and the state (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and international diversification.
To the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate now has to make depreciations that will have a "essential material effect" on the group's profit and loss account, it is quite undecided.
The fact is, the dividend has been removed.
Already in 2007, she had been reduced by two thirds.
The Hypo Real Estate has been an important state and infrastructure financier since the Depfa takeover.
It is more dependent on refinancing on the interbank market than other institutions because it has no client deposits.
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending among the banks is largely out of stock, as the banks had their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs to refinance some of the short-term funds for the loan portfolio of Depfa for some of the approximately 50 billion euros each year.
According to the Hypo Real Estate, the Group's financing needs are covered by the loan over a foreseeable period of time and the company is shielded from the influence of the currently largely inoperable international money markets.
It can be heard from other sources that thanks to the money, the refinancing will be secured by the end of 2009.
The CEO of HRE Georg Funke stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group would no longer have to use the money markets at the foreseeable time.
The Bundesbank and the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsversicherung (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now ensured.
This stands for the bank's shareholders and creditors to hope for.
But given the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there seems to be no certainty.
It is not even inconceivable that funding does not have to be used in full.
But also the opposite is not to be removed.
After the late Sunday evening of hearing after the bank was still before insolvency, the least temporary rescue could not soothe the spirits.
The share price drops by 75 percent to EUR 3.30.
On the other hand, the bond rates are quite right.
If the principal debt is hardly moving, the rates of the subordinated bonds are more marked.
In particular, the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, understandably, the maturities beyond 2009.
If hypo-real-estate bonds appear to be a speculative investment alternative before, their worth must be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system, following the marked strengthening of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had only taken over the Depfa crisis.
As long as the central banks, governments and less-favoured commercial banks are still ready to support the system, it may be assumed that pensions will be abolished in due time.
Or it happens that what hardly anyone dares to hope at the moment - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports which have been transmitted to the nationalisation, the probability of security has now become only a legitimate hope.
This is particularly likely for long-term believers to prepare some sleepless nights by deciding whether to separate themselves from their engagement.
Short-term investors may nevertheless use a closing line to form a loss grant for future tax payments on price gains in later years.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bento-Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, introduces himself on the first day of school at Tachibana High School, the girls begin to look: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
I had a lot of fun before I left school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and drive for 40 minutes by train to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find the way alone, and fortunately, I didn't walk.
The beginning of lessons at the Tachibana does not seem as strict as at our home in Lower Saxony.
From eight o'clock until twenty before nine o'clock a brief meeting with the teacher begins, the 'home room'.
But before class began, I was in line to introduce myself.
I'm not the guy who likes to talk in front of people, even before a class of 40 students.
Because I haven't had a school uniform yet, I've dressed an old skirt of my guest mom, blouse, blue knee skirts and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I put myself in front of the pult and tried to put everything right: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - I'm Sylvana, come from Germany and have a week's birthday.
At the moment, I was very happy that I had already started to learn the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all cuddled, peeked and waved and I have constantly heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew that from my mangas.
It belongs to the surviving vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'neat, sweet'.
Then I quickly got my seat.
The girl next to me was grinning pretty wide, she thought it was an honor for the exchange student to sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the Gong sounded, I was really stunned.
Everyone talked and peeked and asked me holes in my stomach - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, everyone unpacked their Bentos.
My guest mother had made me a lunch box - that's something different than the oust German break bread.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, lettuce made of cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in tofu mantle.
Mostly I don't have a pale shimmer, what exactly I eat here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
It's firm that everything is really delicious.
Well, except for the salty plums, perhaps, brrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
Sometimes it happens that a girl gives a self-prepared Bento to a boy, who then teaches her particularly artfully - in the hope of getting to know the boy more closely during a break.
That's what I read in my manga comics.
I'm excited if I can watch this.
'Why Japan?', my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school for a year in Tokyo.
I've always said:
"Because it fascinates me."
Finally, I've been reading Mangas for years.
And so that I better understand the comics and culture in it, I started to learn a little Japanese some time.
So for me, it was perfectly clear that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I also have a faible for tradition, customs and customs.
And that's where you put great value.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I have not felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I have ever seen."
Rats also have feelings
A rat or a sheep flees at risk means that she also feels afraid?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: Many animals also have feelings.
Only how can you check if they feel the same way when they behave the way we do?
The Internet magazine "Edge" has been publishing contributions by famous scientists for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else being able to prove this so far where we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, at least we can hope, as all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and cut to pieces the questions of sensitivity or generally of consciousness, we enter inpermanent terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it sets itself dead, flees or attacks.
People behave similarly, from which some scientists conclude a comparable subjective experience.
I don't believe in that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its involvement in the short-term memory and in the execution/control functions).
This broad region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and seems to be missing entirely in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on prefrontal Cortex, including the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is therefore reason to believe that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic characteristic is likely to lie in the linguistic nature of man: Since so much of his experience is associated with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case one could exclude animals.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would certainly affect it, so that animal consciousness, as it may be, probably differed very much from most of our states of consciousness.
It is therefore difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If it can be analyzed, as something internal and subjective, neither measured nor, because of the special hardware, based on our own experience, then his research presents us with great problems.
Most of my remarks relate to the content of the conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be more scientifically accessible.
One could examine the consciousness processes of animals without regard to their contents, and this is precisely what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially on the example of visualization.
But in this approach, followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, one shifts to the neural correlates of consciousness rather than to the causal mechanisms: Both may be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasises the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the state of visualization.
What happens to the sensations now?
I lead them back to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of his own activity conscious brain.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the brain localized defense system (or its consequences, like physical reactions) proves memory.
In view of this, sensations are closely linked to the regions of Cortex, which distinguish primates and especially people.
Linked to linguistic nature, fine degrees of sensation arise because we can differentiate and categorize with the help of words and grammar states, in order to assign them to ourselves as well as to others.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio, for example, says that sensations from primitive activities in the body-feeling regions of the Cortex and the brain stem are similar to Jaak Pankseep, which is more focused on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could well be involved in cross-density sensations.
I cannot contradict that purely theoretically, but consider it unprovable.
Pankseep argues what appears in rats and people, such as fear, in both cases it probably feels like this: But how can we check whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
A sheep flees at risk if she too feels fear?
In my eyes, mere behavioral similarity is not yet proof of equality of experience.
Although the neural comparison helps: rats and humans have similar brain stems, sheep do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
And even if you could prove this to people, how did you want to prove it to rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even sheep (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their emotions are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior than the emotional sensations of rats.
At any rate, progress at the neural level is wavering if the same is measured for rats and humans.
How I don't research language and consciousness in rats, if not sensations, I don't know if they exist.
You might think this is shortsighted, but I'd rather move forward than running against a wall all the time.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: term of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said that the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the Uefa's decision in Bordeaux as a proof of trust in Ukraine and its ability to host the EM together with Poland," said Watjunik.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still much to do in both countries."
In the timetable for the construction or conversion of the stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, the two hosts are behind.
It may even reduce the number of EM sites from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work at the highest speed," said Ukrainian president Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA will keep an eye on us all the time."
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish Association PZPN has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission had met at the request of Mr Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
It is "the serious danger that the PZPN is unable to act according to the rules," Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP said.
"We assured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for the 2012 EM will not suffer."
A number of first-timers had been convicted of forced descent only in the past season, and even the liga start had to be postponed in the short term.
Rebellious Dennis Quaid Strikes Back
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in an interview about Privates - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood Star Meg Ryan outete her missing Dennis Quaid as a adulteress.
The foamer - and knocks back.
Late Rosenwar at the ex-husband Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after her divorce, the two Hollywood actors are now having an unpleasant fight with each other - in the public.
Meg Ryan had expressed himself for the first time in an interview with the US magazine InStyle last week to the reasons for the marital failure: "I had been unfaithful for a long time, and that was very painful."
The extent of fraud has only brought them into experience after divorce.
The reason for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - the story of a adultery is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband clearly escaped: "Ungenderly" it was, said the 54-year-old of the "New York Daily News", that "Meg for the repeated time again chews and reconsecrates the history of our relationship".
It is also "deplorable" that the joint 16-year-old son Jack is again "publicly reminded of the pain and upheavals that mean a divorce for every child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and has recently become the father of Zwillingen.
And so close his registrations with the page above: "My life goes on anyway.
I am happy that I have a wonderful family that is doing well."
Lower prices for tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008, flights and nights spent in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a recent study, flights were even up to 50 percent cheaper.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have again become cheaper - this is the result of a study by the travel and financial service provider American Express.
The company analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and determined a significant decrease in the second quarter following an increase in prices in the first quarter.
After years of rising prices on the hotel market, nights in many places have already been approved.
From January to March, prices in 41 of 48 European cities surveyed rose by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
From April to June, prices were already 3.6 per cent lower than in the previous year.
The trend in Paris and Rome was most marked, where travellers had to pay between 30 and 37 per cent less than one year earlier.
American Express sees as the cause the weak dollar price that has led to a "degressive travel loss of American tourists".
Financial sites such as Frankfurt or London are also more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices with an increase of 26.3 percent even keep a record in Europe.
The trend in the first quarter was also upward in air prices:
Travelers in the Economy class on average had to pay 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights were even up to 29.2 per cent more expensive.
From April to June, the price of tickets in the Economy class fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but the price changes in the business and first class were much lower.
In Germany, prices increased even more than in other European countries:
From January to March prices had risen by 11.9 per cent, and in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 per cent.
On German domestic flights, according to the study, prices have even halved.
The reason for the price collapse is, on the one hand, the slowdown in economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market breaks.
On the other hand, the Open-Skie Agreement, which liberalises air transport between the US and Europe, increases the pressure on competition.
As a result of the tense situation, the removal of unprofitable routes by airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had filed bankruptcy in the first half of 2008, were 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, the Hamburg SV becomes the leader of the table.
At Borussia, Luhukay continues to fail to find a functioning Elf.
By Kristoffer Klein enlarge breakland for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher only got into the game late and failed with an lever to the latte.
His message was precise, she went convincingly over his lips.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second gate," said Hermann Rieger in the cabin corridor of the Hamburg Arena.
Much was not lost in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most were back in their places.
Rieger was a physiotherapist of HSV for nearly three decades, enjoying a higher reputation than some lost actor.
And so his request also found hearing in charge.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and agreed to the thumb.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, chief coach of Hamburg.
Its command is similar: Here with gate two!
The implementation failed.
"There wasn't anything nice to see today," Marcell Jansen admitted later.
Bastian Reinhardt, too, would have wanted to be more relaxed.
1:0 (1.0) the Hamburgers owe the Mladen Petric's head hit (11.); and the fact that very weak Gladbachers could not hurt the weak hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summarized.
The Hamburg SV will be 121 on this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon the viewers already celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the lightning table on the video wall, which indicated their association as class prime.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to organize this," said Marcelle Jansen.
He suspects that the tabular evidence stands more for the incalculability of the league than for the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its late engagements - the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the Petric gatekeeper and the Jansen who has been expelled from Bavaria by FC Bayern - is slowly finding themselves, but can't yet shine.
"We need more flair and more dribbles," Jol demanded.
After the vote
It's about fear on Wall Street.
First news of the failure of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones to break up temporarily by 700 points.
That was the biggest loss of points within one day in its history.
Later, the Dow caught something.
At 8:30 p.m., the world's most important stock market barometer recorded just over five percent in the minus at 10,579 meters.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was more than seven percent in the minus 1548 points.
The biggest loser at this time was the Dow American Express, which lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of around 12 percent.
No title could be added.
The shares of Bank Goldman Sachs gave up almost ten percent.
Only a few days ago, Großinvestor Warren Buffett had participated in the company.
Under the rescue plan, funds are to be provided for the purchase of so-called lazy mortgage papers.
However, the sum is not to be paid on one impact, but on a gradual basis.
In return, the State should receive stock options from financial corporations that could be redeemed if price developments so as to reduce the burden on the central bank.
Stock prices in Europe and the USA in the downwards search
The billions of aid for banks in Europe and the United States do not resolve the doubts of investors.
The stock price of the German Grand Bank Hypo Real Estate falls and tears down the Dax.
The US index Dow Jones loses by the state despite the planned rescue of the financial market.
Spectacular price losses of the Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have taken a deep cut in the German stock index (Dax).
Despite the rescue operation of the German government and private banks, the Munich real estate financier lost approximately three quarters of its value, which Commerzbank left more than 20 percent.
The Dax clearly slipped under the psychologically important 6000 point mark and recorded with a minus of 3.7 percent at 5,839 points.
Worldwide, the stock markets went to their knees.
Wall Street opened in New York with significant losses.
Investors were afraid that the US government's 700 billion dollar rescue package could not be sufficient to bring financial markets back to fruition.
The Dow lost 334 points in the first trading hour or 3.3 percent to 10,809,25 points.
The U.S. House wanted to vote on the rescue plan, which could follow the Senate vote on 1 October.
The other European stock exchanges also knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE index initially decreased by 3.2 percent, and the CAC 40 lost 2.9 percent in Paris.
In Asia, the Japanese index of Nikkei fell by 1.26 percent on 11.743.61 counters, after winnings.
In Hong Kong, the slope-seng index dropped 2.1 percent to 18,286,90 points.
In India the index Sensex lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12.595.75 counters.
In the MDax, shares of Arcandor gave up after the announcement of a capital increase.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has drawn the 23 million new shares.
The commercial and tourism group also announced that the shares in Thomas Cook will not be sold.
Dark matter affects flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon of research has caused a lack of advice: Dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by manoeuvres.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity of Albert Einstein could not be quite right.
Nearly 18 years the space probe "Ulysses" flew through space.
Because of soon-frozen fuel lines, you are now threatened by the cold cold.
For years a mysterious phenomenon has caused confusion among scientists - the Swing-by-Anomaly.
The Swing-by is a flight manoeuvre of space probes in which they receive additional momentum in the gravitational field of a heavenly body, such as the Earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The Cassini-Huygen European-American research probe used this physical trick as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
But what the researchers have been amazed at for years: the missiles do not behave 100 percent as expected by the old-fashioned gravitational law.
Rather, there are irregularities at the speed.
The probes are unexpectedly getting faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They named him Swing-by-Anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even the general theory of relativity of Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction of matter through a crumbling of space, could not be quite right.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study from Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein was not mistaken, and tries to explain the Swing-by-Anomaly with the help of so-called dark matter that astronomers have formed in the universe.
"Less for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to the earth," he writes.
The space researchers have only known about the existence of dark matter for around ten years.
It obviously assumes an attraction whose effect on other heavenly bodies can be observed.
On the other hand, it itself is completely invisible, that is, it sends and does not reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
After all, the dark matter, according to the calculations of the scientists, accounts for a fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their abductors, the tourists to Egypt were to be free again, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros of ransom.
In a shooting before the release, six hostages should have been killed.
In the south of Egypt, five Germans were kidnapped.
Solving money negotiations should already be under way.
Germans kept coming to the sight of kidnappers.
WORLD ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists to the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported by the Egyptian state television, the Arabic TV channel Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release following reports from the Italian television station Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been liberated.
We're checking her state of health," said Frattini.
The five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions were well up and down, reported the Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are supposed to be already on their way to Cairo.
The backgrounds of a gunfire remain unclear before the hostages were released: hence, the kidnappers were prepared, according to information from an Egyptian security officer, to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom," said the official.
It was "just about receiving the hostages," when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers shot six of the captors on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt and arrested two of them.
The hostages had demanded from Germany a ransom of six million euros; the money should be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported under appeal to a German mediator who delayed the release of hostages because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers intend to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men should be detained until the kidnappers have a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo rejected an opinion on the report.
Misuse of the stepfather "leaded to suicide"
The years of abuse by her stepfather has led to the death of a woman has been reported to a court.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stitians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years in prison after having suffered eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Truro Criminal Court found out that he regularly tied his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession, "I feel responsible for her death."
The court found that Ms. Randle died at her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007 at the age of 34.
When she lived as a child in Coventry, Trerise had tied her up and connected her eyes before performing sexual acts while her mother was away to work in a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court found that Ms. Randle, who worked for the National Trust for a large part of her time on an honorary basis, was persecuted by the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife told the court that friends had said that Mrs. Randle, who had been an zealous surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and "gave up her life"
In April 2007, her real father Terrance Randle found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is believed that she killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that ended up saying, "I used to tie her up and connect her eyes."
"I didn't need them sexually.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "They are an extremely alien fetishist and for their victim it must have been terrifying, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the suicide of the victim.
Worse still is the fact that it is very unlikely that the matter would have ended in court if she had not done so."
He added: "I take note of the effects, according to Stephanie's father and mother, on her daughter over the years.
Otherwise, she would clearly have been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Officials responsible for lost data shall be charged with:
The BBC has learned that the Cabinet official, who had lost strictly confidential documents on one move in June, will be charged with the "Public Security Act".
The man was dismissed by the Ministry of Defense when he lost two extremely confidential documents on a train to Waterloo.
The papers were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no evidence of criminal intent.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the action had been a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "You would have thought that this would be internal to the Ministry of Defense and Cabinet."
The employee, whose name cannot be mentioned, shall be charged with the clause concerning the safe retention of information in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the Act.
The Royal Prosecutor's Office recommended that the officer be charged by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he presented included classified reviews of Al-Quaida and the capacities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his house to a secret place.
Housing companies see B&B costs in mind
British housing companies could face costs of more than 80 million pounds after the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government provided 14 billion pounds to protect Bradford & Bingley's deposits of 2.6 million customers.
Interest on this loan is paid by all companies receiving money from investors, including 59 construction companies.
The Director-General of the Association of Housing Companies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was "unbearable" that the companies and their members would have to pay.
The 14 billion loan will ultimately be repaid if Bradford & Bingley's loans are extinguished.
However, the interest accumulated in the meantime is charged to the 700 financial undertakings which receive deposits each year.
The programme of compensation for financial services confirmed against the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this figure.
It is bitter that those institutions that have acted prudently... are now called upon to take over some of the costs of those institutions that were far less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in relation to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies would have to pay around 18% of the costs together.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest on the loan will amount to 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that companies will have to raise 81 million pounds for the first year's interest.
Adrian Coles, the director-general of the association of housing companies, informed the BBC that he believed this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have acted prudently during the upturn in real estate will now be called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less prudent.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the existence of the records in 1945.
"We will monitor all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs."
The interest due in 2009 covers the seven months from the end of September of this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interest is due for a full year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are mutual organisations without shareholders, their members will have to pay for the costs either through higher fees or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk becomes five pence per litre more expensive
People in Jersey are faced with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two pence increase in February, and comes after investigations by a consulting firm.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether they want to pass on the price increase to their customers.
Before the price increase in February, the wholesale price of Jersey milk changed last year.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh is denied security
A court in Bangladesh refused a bail request from former Prime Minister Scheich Hasina, which means that she could be arrested if she returned to the country.
Their defenders said that the court refused bail regarding the charge of 50 million Taka ($729,700) to have extorted by a businessman while she was prime minister.
The case is one of several floating charges for corruption against them.
Sheikh Hasina's long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released from bail at the beginning of this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, demanded that the military-aided transitional government first grant her full freedom.
Correspondents say that, although their detention was granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear within the framework of their release whether they will be able to remain free when they return to Bangladesh.
Their lawyers say that they will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The upper court has refused Sheikh Hasina's bail claim because it says that she does not have to receive a deposit because she is already on detention abroad to be treated abroad," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will file an appeal against the Supreme Court."
Their lawyers claim that they need bail to return from abroad to the country to prepare for the December elections.
It is expected that Scheich Hasina will return home after October 17th, said an Awami Alliance party president on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the army-supported transitional government had taken over power, but had been released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheich Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fears of the Anti-Polio Initiative in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, almost 200 000 children have not been vaccinated in the recent anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan due to the violence associated with the Taliban.
Last week the United Nations implemented a vaccination programme in six provinces.
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a U.S. spokesman, this was the case despite the Taliban's promise not to attack or hinder the thousands of employees who carried out the vaccinations.
BskyB loses claim in the case of ITV
BskyB has lost its appeal against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share in the competing ITV.
The Competition Tribunal has ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission had claimed that BskyB's share distorts competition and allowed it to have an unfair influence on ITV.
BskyB acquired its share in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the purchase of ITV by BskyB raised doubts about the independence of ITV, which led the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the communication office Ofcom have voted against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV was an unreasonable and exaggerated measure, especially because BskyB had announced its intention to give up its voting rights.
New investigation in the U.S. Public Prosecutor's case
The U.S. Attorney General has commissioned a special agent to deal with the termination of the nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Justice, criticising the actions of the administrative staff.
The report criticised the officials of the White House, legislators and former prosecutor Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by fears that the lawyers had been dropped for political reasons.
The special investigator Nora Dannehy is now to clarify whether the investigators who were interrogated during the investigation have lied to prevent the judiciary.
Serious allegations including criminal proceedings have not been fully investigated or clarified, said the Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
One of his main recommendations was the appointment of a special agent with the power to force the witnesses to make a statement.
The conflict began when in December 2006 the Department of Justice deposed nine U.S. prosecutors from their offices.
At that time, the Ministry argued that public prosecutors would be released because of poor working conditions.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had not been judged worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to view the dismissals as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the judicial persecution of high-ranking Republican congressmen, while others had refused to investigate allegations of electoral fraud.
US prosecutors are assigned to investigate and prosecute cases before the government.
They may be released at any time but may not be suspended for political reasons.
The former head of the Ministry of Justice, Advocate General Alberto Gonzales, has resigned because of the redundancies and has taken up office in the final effect.
A number of officials from the Ministry of Justice have also resigned.
In particular, the report of the Inspector General has critically addressed the role of Gonzales, bearing the "main responsibility" for the redundancies, had shown his leadership role "dedicated" and "extraordinarily disinterested" in the process.
Other officials, including the former Chief Adviser of President Bush Karl Rove, were criticized for the lack of cooperation with the investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song is to be honored
The Rockstar Meat Loaf is to be honored during the music award ceremony "Q Award" for its epic hymn "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will accept his special gold prize next week in London during the award, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
"Coldplay" introduces the nominations for the award of this year after it has come into the narrower selection in four categories.
The editor-in-chief of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said that there were some songs that go beyond such materials as time and genre, and "Bat Out Of Hell" was certainly one of them.
The song written by Jim Steinman required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released as a single in 1979 in Great Britain and reached 15th place in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" has spent about nine years in the charts and sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years. One of them was an operation in 2003 due to irregular heartbeats after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007 he had to cancel concerts due to an acute throat inflammation.
Later it became known that he had a cyst on his vocal band.
Obscured street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon to sell
New York City has thousands of main roads, avenues, side roads and other surrounding roads, some of which are famous and others are just comfortable.
Nevertheless, it is difficult for experienced taxi drivers and long-standing local residents to say where Extra Place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is located in the East Village and runs from First Street to the north between Bowery and Second Avenue, without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alley than after an active pass road.
There are no signposts.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard road map.
This street still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It wants to refurbish Extra Place to create a clean passage to the shops and boutiques expected in the new buildings.
Among other admirers is the long-standing neighborhood, which says that it is fascinated by the short alley, simply because it is one of the remains of the past of the house block.
However, the city administration department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of the residential buildings and is responsible for the road, has no interest in receiving them.
During a meeting of the Municipal Council's Land Use Committee this month, representatives of the City Administration and Avalon Bay have designed a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
Nevertheless, the Committee prefers the street to remain in the hands of the city and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, the district administrator in the Council 3.
"Only very little space has remained in the possession of the city and we want Extra Place to continue to hear the city," she said.
"There could be offers on how to repair and operate the road, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to be guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that the small street would refurbish and refurbish seats intended, among other things, for a café where the company would like to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first made public during the session this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman from Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the street, but it doesn't want them necessarily.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this lost alley and make it a public meeting place," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesperson of the building protection department said it was actually the city's desire to sell the street and stressed that the task of the department was to develop the real estate rather than manage it.
Compared to its colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of its historical impression.
Some believe that the road got its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided between its numerous children and a narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punk rock monument that was closed in 2006, opened to the Extra Place and the street is most well known as a setting for the photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who had taken the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of scrap, rags and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, with the argument that this public property, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a virtually unchanged splitter of the city, which should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called "Jeremiah's Disappearing New York" (with the title "The Book of Complaints: A Bitter Nostalgic View of the Dying City"), has published a part of the conversation of the city history about Extra Place, which appeared in the journal "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at that time: "Extra Place is a small tight dead end, which remains dark even during the day and is marked by rusty metal doors of the warehouses, closed windows and flying weekly newspapers passing by raindrops."
With a few exceptions, the street has just looked like that in an evening.
A rat ran through the rear part of the road, not far from the door that previously led to the CBGB, where today is a more expensive clothing store.
Graffiti was seen on the walls and an empty beer bottle was on the ground not far from a fresh bundle of arranged newspapers.
Some passersby said they had rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road could be polished up a bit.
Fields, added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the attraction of the street in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, damp and disgusting.
Debate on bilingual education: Education in English-speaking environments
In this edition of the "Education Watch", Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, head of science in California studies and director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: why the middle class needs a selection".
Addressing the Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama's election campaign mentions that "the probability of successful school completion in African-American and Hispanic students is lower than in white students" - what is true.
In order to close this gap, Obama's education plan recommends, among other things, a bilingual transition phase in training for those who learn English first.
The question to Obama, however, is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on teaching in languages other than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the distance in education.
Consider Sixth Street Prep, a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of students are Hispanic and come from families with low incomes.
More than one third of students, many of whom have only recently been in the country, learn English.
Nevertheless, in 2008 an amazing 100 percent of fourth-class students passed the state exam in Mathe at a good level.
Also surprising were 93 percent of children from the fourth year of school assessed well in English exams.
This amazing success has been achieved with methods other than those preferred by Obama.
The Sixth Street School focuses on checking and exercising, on continuous control of knowledge and a position that does not tolerate exceptions.
The school also practises the approach of learning in an English-speaking environment. That’s exactly what Obama is supposed to take into account, says the headmaster Linda Mikels.
This approach places importance on the almost exclusive use of English language in specialist education.
Ms. Mikels, who rejected the idea of bilingual education, told me that the school had a remarkable success with a student who had just come from Mexico. 12 months later you would enter the classroom and not be able to recognize him.
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like the Sixth Street Prep as a model for other schools with a large proportion of Latin American and other English learners?
The achievements of the school would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational positions within its own party (the National Associations for the Arts have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and its own consistent support of bilingual education make predictions about Obama's response uncertain.
While agreeing to the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the subject by saying that people should stop worrying about the "only English" legislation.
Instead, he said, "You should make sure your child can Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close the performance gap, he should carefully consider educational models that work rather than despise and trivialize them.
Oil prices are falling as a result of renewed fears for the economy
The oil price on Monday has fallen strongly because of the fears that even the American financial market rescue plan could not be enough to revive the economy.
The oil futures at the New York Stock Exchange have fallen by 7 percent in the morning session to $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday, the price has dropped by more than $20.
In the last two weeks, goods markets have been shaken by both financial turbulence on Wall Street and strong cyclones in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prices in July had reached their peak of $145.29 per barrel, they fell this month to almost $90 per barrel, then to rise again, as a result of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday investors have shown concern again, although Congress representatives had announced that they had agreed on a rescue plan at the weekend, which should be the greatest in history.
This news was overestimated by new concerns that the financial crisis was still far from complete.
In the more recent chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government announcement on Monday, the Citigroup is supposed to buy up the bank operations of the Wachovia Corporation.
In the meantime, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place on the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it seems that it has not succeeded in revitalising the mood in the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, it is expected that demand for goods, including oil, will continue to decline.
Analysts from the Deutsche Bank have written in a communication to investors that forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe they continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
"From the perspective of goods markets, we are most concerned about whether the US virus is spreading worldwide, especially to China."
The bank's analysts have corrected their expectations for oil consumption due to the weak economic growth for the coming year, and their forecasts for the price of oil and gas for 2009 have decreased by 20%.
Team record created by series in the second quarter
Internal defender Shaun Ellis thought he saw everything after he spent the last eight and a half years more often than anyone else in the Jets tricot.
Then on Sunday he saw the second quarter, in which the Jets turned an unprofitable game into a triumphal move.
"I've never seen anything like this before," said Ellis.
After a sloppy game between the jets and the Arizona cardinals, which corresponded to the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when Quarterback Brett Favre's Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, it marked the perfect start for an afternoon in which her developing cooperation made a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, which one time took off as an outside defender and the other 10 seconds before the end of the half-life.
"I didn't make much effort," says Coles about the passports that went to Coles.
"He's a super player.
Our vote voted, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles were playing, the defense took Kurt Warner apart.
Foreign defender Darrelle Revis caught an unfortunate throw and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and caught him off.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss of Warner.
The last ball loss, forced by Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The cardinals had captured the ball with another 10 seconds left in the game when the jets recaptured the ball and Jay Feely turned a 20-yard shot to a 34-to-0 lead.
That was most of the points the Jets had ever scored in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini replied, the coach of the jets "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
To both of the answers, because the Jets had 21 points in the third quarter without achieving a single one, Mangini said, "Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were achieved in a short time."
Rebellious Gebrselassie beats his world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has shown again why some people think he is the best long-distance runners of all time after breaking their own record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first man to make the 42.2 km track in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved its previous result of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had reached last year in Berlin.
Gebrselassie, 35, has thus set up his 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he has reached at least a world championship title or a world record on each route from one kilometer to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie released the Olympic Marathon in Beijing, out of fear, which was perhaps exaggerating in posterity, that air pollution could aggravate his asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - at sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the finish - Gebrselassie won at an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have switched to long-distance trains, the record time for marathons in the last 10 years has fallen by more than 2 minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had had cramps in his Wade two weeks ago and could not therefore train a week.
He was obviously refreshed after a break and did not return rusted.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"Everything went perfectly well.
I resumed the training a week ago and had some concerns today, but at the end everything was great."
He was criticized for this - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's rival from East Africa - that he overly orchestrated his races, many of the world's best marathon stars generally avoid relying too much on the race leaders as if this were a race, and world records about the competition.
However, this criticism hardly harms the size of bürselassies as long-distance runners.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the center of the line in 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi have continued to challenge Gebrselassie after leaving the pacemakers behind.
A little more than three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie made his last start to separate from Kwambai, who arrived second in 2:05:36 and thus improved his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi became third-party at 2:07:48.
In women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, completed a remarkable year by showing with 2:19:19 the seventh fastest result of all times.
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from the UK.
Last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko had won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing because of problems described as back injury. However, she recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She planned her run by having a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners kicked out, but overtaken after 30 kilometers.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia was second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya arrived as third in 2:25:01.
The pride and rigors in the lives of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden between the expanses of leisure parks in the vicinity of Orlando, a few miles from the glittering, loud and gigantic drive, is a quiet city where the pride and complications of African-American culture come to light.
Eatonville, the first black city in the country and the home town of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three hot spots, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison."
Today it is a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, the city that describes it – and which made it a tourist outing destination by including it in the Florida travel guide, which was produced at the time of depression by the Federal Writer Project – is in many respects a place of the very special variety.
Eatonville is so independent, virtuous and private as in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man, who "knows so little about us that he does not know what goes wrong with him."
Even today, in a year in which a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open conversation about racial relations, many are still sorry to be observed by outsiders.
"We are very concerned about how our story is told," says Hortense Jones, 59, from the birth of a resident of the city and a member of the community of the oldest church in the city.
It has to be true."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historical example of the black movement and a municipality of nearly 2,400 inhabitants, where the poverty rate is twice the country average.
It is, on the one hand, a stronghold of literature and, on the other hand, an example of the black culture, sometimes condemned, sometimes praised, of rural south, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that residents here are both proud and on guard.
And so correctly, the concerns about Eatonville's image began with Zora, as all Hurston call here.
She introduced her hometown to the world in books that came from the heart and were written in Mundart, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida tour guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road that leads through the often forgotten centre of Florida, to the sites of black history and human drama.
Naughty as Oskar in both real life and literature, Hurston’s readers led to the store of Eatonville’s first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private affairs.
"Besides the street to the left," she wrote, "there is the brown white painted modern school, with its well-kept gardens and playgrounds, which always takes care of Howard Miller, although he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new man of Witwe Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "drinks of any kind sold and what-also-fits to hour rooms."
In just a few hundred words Hurston thus brought Eatonville into contact with self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
This was certainly not a guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by all.
"Zora described the things as they were," said the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls who immortalized the Hurston by quoting the men who sang songs about their beauty that were full of sexual adulations.
She added, "Some people didn't like this."
One still remembers Hurtson as a lively eccentric who returned regularly after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that when Hurston came to the city, she did so mostly without warning, in a noisy chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants, in a city that today imagines something of its venerable style of dress.
According to Mr Franklin, most of the inhabitants were fascinated, whereas many despised them.
"The people were always glad to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But "she never stayed too long," he added as he rocked in his chair, on a back-facing terrace overlooking the Sabelia lake, where Hurston was baptized in all probability.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were lost.
Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them together with most of the world.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived, in an anonymous grave.
In Eatonville there was no great commemorative celebration, no public readings in great style.
"I don't think they understood their contribution in the world or their heritage in the least," says Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography about Hurston that was published in 2003.
The turn came in the 1980s.
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-track highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-track main street of the municipality.
Orlando's suburbs had already pushed the 4 motorway through the western outskirts.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult phase in his history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the congregation.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixture brought hatred to the community.
"At this time a lot of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff at the people sitting away," said Mr. Franklin.
"There was even a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In 1955, Hurston questioned in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel the demand of the Supreme Court to force integration by calling its decision "respecting rather than my race" in the case of Brown against the School Council.
Citizens today say that although the withdrawal of racial sentiment was positive in some respects, it weakens the group's cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember - they hugged his teacher in the morning and they hugged his teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and managing director of the non-profit group to protect the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained for so long, she added until teachers and students were no longer from the same place.
"You didn't embrace his white teacher, because he was a white teacher - I mean there is a cultural divide," said Ms. Nathiri.
However, citizens' rights have contributed to the creation of space for further Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actors and artists who have turned their backs on prejudices, as she did, with positive self-confidence and statements such as: "How can anyone deny the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker headed for Hurston's nameless grave and began to fight for the revival of her fame.
Five years later, a highly acclaimed Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway was found in the bookshelf, and made it again part of the American literature canon.
The long-distance project came exactly at a time when Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again in the light of the public.
And this time Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The municipality began planning a Hurston festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy by building the motorway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road plans.
"The plans of a five-track long-distance street revitalized the city, accelerated the whole thing at top speed, aroused real citizens' pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd put it a little easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the long-distance project has contributed to a change in the city's self-image.
There were more and more train trips, such as Rachelle Munson, an attorney who has been going to church since 1993 and locals began to appreciate the past.
Eatonville was registered in the national historical register in 1998.
A new one-storey library (of course named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a special feature in Florida: only 6 miles from Orlandos city centre, it can sometimes feel like a back alley in summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It is 90% black nowadays.)
Outsiders in search of Eatonville's history and its significance are often treated with caution.
For most interviews, authorisation is necessary in advance and certain things - such as the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man and representing black men in field work - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a courageous, self-conscious teacher with a preference for dark red, still fear that her shielded community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time that the Hurston Festival grew, a higher degree of home pride was also born.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw their whole race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither worse nor better and just as proud, creative and diligent, silly and mixed up as any other race and ethnic group in America.
It is the genuine love of this city that you can hear in Mr. Franklin's nephew's voice, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who has planned to return to Eatonville after college, to work in the city administration or in the police, who according to him could use some help.
And even the younger ones, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who only pass through here will think, "Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others," said Alondra Kenon recently on a Sunday after the church.
"But if you actually stop and look at his story for a moment, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, we speak fluent financial Latin.
Nothing has changed at first sight.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspaper stands and the huge TV screens in Times Square, they would not even notice that they are in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shoebox-like offices with the glass façades, bankers and hedge funds managers who have the monopoly in New York, daily have the worst horror work day since the fall of 1929.
The suppliers are still pushing the metal teaws along the sidewalks and transport tablets loaded with muffins for the breakfast sessions.
Latinos still slump between apartments, as human packers loaded with around the 50 curved T-shirts hanging on a yoke-like bar lying on their shoulders.
Office workers are still waiting for their breakfast stalls to rise to their citizens and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a day of the week between 16 and 19 o'clock.
It didn't feel like a crisis at all until Thursday afternoon, due to all the world's downfall speech, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had decided to lay my duty on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase tribal branch, there were already about 20 people snakes.
Not at the money counters to collect or pay money, but at the customer service desk where regular customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for the way to Macy's department store and where new customers open accounts.
Most in front of me, I later learned from Starr, my "personal banker with license" for the same reason as I was snake.
In contrast to me, however, they had already removed their savings from smaller banks, from places where they commuted, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had abolished money from so-called Thrifts (a little like a building savings bank), cooperative banks and those local savings banks that only have branches in a state and say they treat their customers like family.
Last year, 15 of these banks went quietly and quietly.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with facilities worth $327 billion, went to bankruptcy and went home over the weekend as the last Friday of New Yorkers, was Wachovia, another bank that owns savings facilities worth $440 billion, looking for a saving buyer.
In fear of another crash, the office and shop workers who stood before me brought their bars to a bank that is considered a secure port, a bank that is responsible for most of the rescue purchases on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorker has acquired a flowing latent in the last few weeks.
A woman who phoned in my Chinese parent market took so much familiarity with Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and its demagogic Chairman Dick Full, as if she were blatant about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my apartment block, has escaped from our usual entertainment themes about Brad and Angelina and my food supply.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds," she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I changed, I'm not going in a risko anymore."
Muslemic graves damaged during right slide in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing judge of the Austrian Right-wing Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, member of the Belgian Right-wing Pertei Vlaams Important, take part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008, in order to represent the organisation "Cities Against Islamization".
They wear signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is depicted, painted with a red line.
The police accuse right-wing extremists of grave damage at a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend at the extreme right party, of having significant profits in the country's choice of parliament.
During the night from Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves at the Traun Cemetery near Linz were severely damaged in an organized action, according to the police.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols such as the David Star on some of the graves, but criminals consider this to be an attempt to conceal the motive of the extremists driven by hatred on Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way in connection with the elections.
A speaker of the local Islamic community said she was "deeply shaken" about the news of the burial which took place as the religious month of Muslim Ramadan tends to end.
At the same time, a round of conscience research is taking place in Austria after the country slipped to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The FPÖ and Allianz for the future of Austria, the two far right-wing parties who received almost 30% of the votes, stood in their election campaign for a strict anti-immigrant law and some of their electoral claims were criticized by opponents as aliens.
Heinz-Christian Strache, Chairman of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the votes, advocated a ban on headgear and Burkas and even expressed his aversion to food that is generally associated with Islam.
At his last rally in Vienna, he spoke of a "European Brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets with the argument that these political symbols are a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the election indicating that the extreme rights are the most politically strong bloc in the country indicate that this new development is based on young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Exterior barriers for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star who has been convicted of sexual abuse of children, was legally forbidden to travel to France and Spain.
Judge Glitter posted a six-month lock after informing the controlling authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
The Kent police were granted the last Thursday to impose a travel ban after they presented proof to the judges of Glitter's criminal punishment for the sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, the real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford District Court in Kent, but was represented by the law firm Corker Binning.
Ein Speaker of the Court of Justice stated: "On Thursday, 25 September, the police requested Kent from Ashford County Court the permission to prevent travel abroad from Mr Paul Glad to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not personally present."
As required by the register for sex offenders, Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could lead to a prison sentence of 5 years.
The Kent police said that they would not discuss individual cases or glitters of possible residence in the country.
A spokesperson from Kent's police unit said, "The police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad."
"We believe it is easier to control someone who is in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks."
"It is the prime concern of Kent police to protect Kent's inhabitants and we work closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sex offenders in the country to minimize any risk that might exist for the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of 2 girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he felt unwell and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through the passport control and he flew to Hong Kong after some to and from.
The Chinese authorities also refused him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he return to Britain.
Last but not least, he arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge District Court in West London, since Scotland Yard had successfully requested permission to ask him to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had previously been detained in the United Kingdom for 4 months in 1999 because of the possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, Interior Minister Jacqui Smith was calm and satisfied that Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
`I receive the master behind the stage to capture his character', Günter Brauer, photographer.
No heels, no skirts, no costumes for appearance.
The nature of the great flamencot dancers who refrain from concentration and devote themselves to interpretation in order to get a relaxed appearance as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand, artists
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, into those moments that are foreign to the audience, I know when I can find typical gestures for the personality, the depth of a stolen look or expression of the hands that are concerned because they are not going to enter the stage.
In his project `Flamenco-people', German photographer Günter Bauer presents a variety of theatrical performances on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this page he was still little known for the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flamenco presentation at different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the program of the month of photography of flamenco, reflects the international importance of flamenco, which is growing from day to day, the artist explains and makes it clear that 'flamenco-people' can be any person, but when you look at the photos, the viewer realizes that there are no typical images of artists on stage.
Very normal people on the portraits are artists who are able on stage to convey passion, sadness, joy and thereby move the audience.
In order to capture the personality of these artists, you don't have to take photos on stage.
Her personality and character are in her heart.
What interested me was to create a personal atmosphere that would allow me to capture the characters of the greatest flamenco masters with the camera.'
Bauer, inspired by the festival `Cante de las Minas', made a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, created images that remind you of classical photography.
The application of various stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, thereby giving the image the modernity and the idea, as the farmer understands Flamenco: 'Music with traditional roots that change and surprise every day'.
This is not only the dance, the singing or the instrumental play in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain something that becomes visible in the form of listening, of being, was and was the firm aim of this work, which will be presented in the next time in the gallery of El Fotómata.
Known personalities in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Moreente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the close selection of almost seventy artists who were photographed.
The project became an anthology of flamenco and will soon be published as a book, with all portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for the portraits led him to pick up this idea two years ago and to realize it as 'portraits of the veterans of the sport' ('SportART project').
Although the concepts of the project `Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer gives me a lot of pleasure in photographing people, getting to know them and putting me in their state of life, whether for a short moment or for a longer time.
I think in the field of photography the portrait is the most difficult type.
You meet or meet people, personalities you don't even know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a picture.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer I always try to realize my ideas.'
Today's collection of portraits of the flamenco called 'Flamenco-people' is exhibited in the gallery of El Fotómata, which is located in the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules. You can visit the exhibition until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admits that the Roma he's just writing is 'a great quality'.
He doesn't know where the novel is going and what it's about, but Mario Vargas Llosa is persistently trying to advance the project he's currently working on, a novel with protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon area.
Yesterday, during his presence at the festival Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel Prize winner admitted that the project with which he is engaged is 'a great quality' and 'everything indicates that he would not have to write the novel'.
`If I was mindful, I wouldn't have done it, but I will do it and hope to end the novel sometime', so he concluded his participation in the festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within the four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of `La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who won the premium of the Hay Festival and gave her voice to most of the present, will be compared to the old edition of `Our Mutual Friend' and will be seen at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and found that he had an audience in front of him, who noticed that the Peruvian, who has a wonderful memory and a great sense of humor, was not given enough time to go through everything again: as his appeal to literature was created from 'extraordinary adventure', from 'joy reading' and from 'more experienced than before'; as he writes and 'discipline observes', to complement 'the lack of inspiration', his intensive work with documentation, numerous corrections and revisions that he makes; as Faulkner, Víctor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his appeal and what 'memory images' are the basis for his stories.
The Hispano-American novelist admitted that there is `no way' to measure and how to know whether books change life, 'but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience', said Vargas Llosa, who claims that it 'produces effects' and 'brings people even more apart', so I asked the writer 'don't leave his ease' and 'take responsibility' for his vocation.
At the festival in Pozoblanco, the weather did not play with: Bullfighting fell out in part.
After the bullfighters announced that the ground of the square was in bad condition, the bullfighting festival, with which the festival was to be concluded in Pozoblanca, was transferred to yesterday morning.
The organizer, with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to postpone the bullfighting festival.
Thus, the feast was put on unsteady weather, which is why two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it was raining that the second proposed bullfighting festival could not be celebrated.
The Matadore group consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bullring.
That's just how there was a party on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut down three ears and triumphed after he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
On the same evening Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the bull, which he had achieved more by galloping than by his bullfighting.
And even worse was El Juli, who passed through the arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After fighting so badly, most of the audience responded to his second fight with Buh-Rufen.
In Álava two persons wanted to escape the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow: five minutes before ten.
Transport controls in Ertzaintza, Armiñon (Álava) city area.
Two policemen called on the drivers of the car to stop, and they took refuge.
It looked as if they would not have to stop with the cargo of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
The police followed her and arrested one of the drivers, the man who was 28 years old, known as A. A. J., as announced by the Ministry of the Interior of the Basque State.
The arrested person was accused of drug trafficking and counterfeiting of official documents.
The incident occurred when the traffic police officers of the region of Álava had already completed traffic control on the N-1 and passed through the city area of Armiño.
She decided to stop a car to perform the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to avoid the control.
The police began the persecution until the car stopped at the edge of the road after a few kilometres. At the moment, the drivers got out of the car to flee across a country road to a forest area.
The police in the town of Ertzaintza finally picked up one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, drug traffickers transported 2,178 kilos of hashish, which was confiscated by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with hashish bundles, which were later directed to the exact laboratory analysis and deflecting the bundle to other police departments.
In addition, the officials found that the mark was 'doublet', so that it did not match the markings given in the car papers, which is why there was also a arrest for falsification of official documents.
The police in the city of Ertzaintza continue to investigate the arrest of the second suspect, who, as mentioned earlier, could flee, but also to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
The 28-year-old A. A. J. was taken to a police station to be heard and brought to the jailer in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the effect of an unknown drug.
The actress Heather Locklear, known for the role of Amanda from the series "Melrose Place", was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the effect of an unknown drug.
A Witness observed how she tried to get out of her park gap in Montecito in a rather strange way, California police spokespersons reported the 'People' magazine.
The witness explained in detail that Locklear 'pressed gas pedal after 4:30 p.m. and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car back or forward from the parking gap, and when she drove back, she caught herself several times on her sunglasses'.
A little later, the Witness, who at the beginning probably had not known the actress, saw Locklear staying on a nearby road and getting out of the car.
The witness was the person who notified the emergency service because she had 'afraid of Locklears'.
When the police raid came, they found the actress sitting in her car, standing across the street and thus blocking the traffic.
'They seemed to be unorthodox', so they brought the police to a special drug and alcohol centre to test.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress showed cooperative, excessive alcoholism was ruled out from the first moment. `Concerning the first observations of the officials, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug', the speaker said.
Locklear was arrested under the suspicion of driving under the influence of an undetermined substance that could not be determined and brought to a local investigation about 7:00 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released from the Arizona clinic, where she was treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the United Left Andalusian Association will be responsible for the case of Silva.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and members of the United Left, has today assured that the regional association for education will be the one who will make the decision in the case of the former Council for Youth and Sport of the City Hall in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who had resigned last week after he was accused of doing business with family members.
`In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one who has to take responsibility for it,' Llamazares pointed out, which approach the party must have against that which has so far been sitting in Seville City Council.
Nevertheless, the president of the VL defended the need for 'transparency' in the possible investigations of the regulatory breaches that Silva might have started: 'The VL always insisted that such cases should receive the maximum transparency'.
With regard to this issue, he stressed that education has 'a strict ethical code for all public offices'.
`Sangre de mayo': Hero book of Garci
Inspired by `Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in `Sangre de mayo' represents the revised version of the famous Spanish uprising against the French. This is an admirable film in filmography, with about 15 million Euro investment for the shooting.
In this way, the Cinemast has tried to depict 'a lot of personalities and social analysis', which he has always admired at the works of the famous novelist, today Carci explained at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long directory of the performers.
`Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, will be presented this Friday in cinemas and later shown on the TV station Telemadrid as a four-hour miniseries.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of Galdó's literature, assures us that thanks to this film his 'Kindheitstraum' was fulfilled. He owes this to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago from the autonomous community of Madrid to film a memorial film for the second century celebration in Madrid on November 2. Especially because history is based on 'Episodios Nacionales', he accepted the order.
The total contribution of 15 million, made for shooting by the autonomous community of Madrid, Garci offers, as he has provided, the 'one-off opportunity' with the help of decorations and corresponding clothing, the image of 'disturbed Spain', which chose the wrong leader for the struggle, because the people had been brought back to life through the struggle for independence and under the rule of Ferdinand VII.'
However, the cinematist regrets that it was not possible to count on the funding of `Alatriste' or `Los fantasys de Goya' (two times as high as at `Sangre de mayo'), so some scenes from the screenplay with Horacio Valcárcel, with which Garci almost worked his entire career, could not be filmed.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in 'Volver a empezar', took part in his usual way of working: he appeared on stage to the actors with whom one has to test first before one starts shooting and for those who had not made casting, he appeared 'humiliating' and respect, 'a part of the job of the film director is to provide help in theater and cinema to know what is happening in the cinema industry in which one works.'
Many performers he encounters in `Sangre de mayo' must repeat in front of his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (of which he won one), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates represented in Spain before the Academy of Hollywood this year represent a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither `Sangre de mayo', nor `Siete mesas de billar francés', nor finally the selected film 'Los girasoles ciegos'.
Garci doesn't expect any awards for this movie.
`At the beginning, you believe you're working for the offspring, later you'll know that it's only for growth, and now you're satisfied if you've produced a movie', explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional activity.
Isabel Bayón calls back the memory of the dancer from Seville Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville honors a dancer who is also from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Katalane (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the Triana district and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and expert for oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters to emancipate the woman, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, a vegetarian, and opposed the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free female movement.
The life of this woman, who left her traces of the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe in the time between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
`I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role to me, which seemed impossible to me.'
'We're not trying to tell about her life without keeping her Esprit,' said the flamenco dancer.
Your dance bases helped me in Flamenco a lot.
`The dance of the butterfly' appeared to me, for example, like Guajira, or 'the dance of the snake' like Tango.
Her dancing was sensual and I've been told that my dancing is also in this aesthetic area', she claims.
The staging is based on two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing for Isabel at one of their performances, as he did in `La puerta aberera'; and with flamenco master Matilde Coral, who wanted to work with one of her ex-students.
`Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature personality.
I am happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I feel very honoured.'
The staging also counts with musical composition and guitarists Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Juarez, he assumes the role of the companion of the artists who were Divas, in whom he repeatedly falls in love.'
This work also tells in a certain way of the life of this woman, who has been known in such far-reaching places as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, although she has normally lived in London.
'I wanted to call her back in memory, because I think she is one of the women who have a huge influence on a particular era and whose works are no longer of value today, and therefore they know even less', says Bayón.
The show will take place today at 20:30 at the Theater Lope de Vega.
The publication of the book `Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of `Diario de un poeta recién casado' in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married in 1916 Zenobia, offers a corresponding atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture to celebrate the 'Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008). The goal is to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the day of death of the two.
Thus `the Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' will be completed with the new edition of this work, with the international congress taking place in New York, with the restoration of the house-museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the hiking exhibition `Juan Ramón Jiménez: `Aquel chopo de luz', which was opened in May and, after which it was in various places in Andalusia, now reached New York and is presented during the course of the international congress.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of `Diario de un poeta recién casado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The aim is to make the person and the work of the Andalusian world poet better known.
The USA can imagine badly without Paul Newman
Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them."
This sentence comes from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in 'sensation reporter', and from the then dominant idea of the American cinema, which was abandoned, came from all America to Newman with his enthusiastic idea and followed it.
Now, look what it cost him to give him the Oscar.
And when he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Nevertheless, it was a big blow for everyone.
`What one sometimes feels is much more than an expression, and now I've lost a great friend', Robert Redford said crying, `my life and my country were the greatest fools of his life.'
No one was afraid of either making himself ridiculous or exaggerating.
As the 'father' of cinema and the fatherland, he died in a sad moment, in which fear of terrorists and of the collapse of the market prevails, in which the downhearted self-esteem of the US Americans is in the hopeless search for reasons to retain dignity.
If in this hard time without virtue only a few people can be admired, you don't necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied almost a Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered as various losses both gains: from the foundation that dedicated itself to the fight against drugs and in honor of his son from the first marriage, who died of overdose, was founded up to its own brand of homemade and organic products.
All of this is a gift for the country in which it took a lot of effort for him to go against a deadly culture of nutrition.
A wide wave of surprise beats haushoch about Hollywood without taking into account nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one person died but the whole era.
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar Prize winner, said that the work with Newman was no more or no less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
'We have left the greatest of all of us', confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of a few who are confident of living today as Paul Newman lived: high standards of integrity, a responsible private life, lead far away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there is someone who tries, and Paul Newman was an example of it.
He divorced once and was then married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, who he was faithful, although there were certainly many possibilities not to be.
`Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have Filet at home?' he joked himself often.
In heaven he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily customary in America.
"From all the great roles which he played, he was not so proud as the faithful husband, the loving father, the attentive grandfather, and those of the Philanthropist," they say.
The streets in Madrid are defective for the Olympics.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to organize some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure of 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder: 'Are we prepared for it?'
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it's not true!
She was called the perfect road, and in my opinion, she was the worst road with everything in and around it.
Of course, it is a lot of nonsense if you take note of the evaluation and I could check it, that would clearly not have happened.
But, let's go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the ticket pick-up that allows you to go first.
It doesn't seem to me to be bad either, but if they let you do it, they should give you everything (including a chip to avoid the traffic jam on the road).
I don't think so.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first nonsense that consists of just going there) and (after an infinite queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in size `S' (a second nonsense because I need size XL)
Where do we actually live?
Or is it that after the crisis it was decided only to buy small, much cheaper shirts made of less fabric?
All right, things like these are a little bit compared to the days on the street.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a waiting line of at least 15 minutes and, moreover, you have to leave the backpack.
Waiting has taken more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a street where 11,000 people are expected.
Finally, as it was expected, the road started and we had not left our backpacks in front of it, even if it had succeeded once, but it would have been more difficult to recover.
In addition, it looked like a 40-minute wait for rain, so it came to the temptation to organize a popular uprising and attack the house.
I think tomorrow will certainly have some 500 people pneumonia and some like me because of this chip that I've got not even appear in time for the classification, I can imagine that the outcome has been incorrectly stamped out.
Of course, if you were to ask me for a perfect road, this road would never bother me.
So I think we're going to dream of a city that is well prepared for the Olympics.
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the `Emerging Technology Conference', organized by MIT, Microsoft has presented the progress of the new image identification system and human interaction, a essence of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which is however capable of performing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or, in the case of Microsoft, it is a route planner to move on to the campus of the company).
Thanks to a camera and a form and face recognition system, this `receptionist' can see how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their entertainment.
It can also arrange for those present to join the groups after the talks.
In the presentation video, `the receptionist' notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not associated with the group that leads with her conversation and that neither is a company employee.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone here and answers that she will listen soon.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impressive
That is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week they talked very superficially about Microsoft's strategy change.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have so many embedded programs.
Steve Ballmer noted that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary, instead of filling them with the commercial waste, they would work five times faster. Human, Steven, that will only be for the few.
Everything is just a statement when you consider that Microsoft has added some feature and `Extras' in Windows versions.
The change of direction is worthwhile
The Microsoft is right to lose the operating system gradually in importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, it was part of the theory that it was the first step by Google to compete with Windows.
Skillfully, many point out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary for hardware and software to work at the same time.
The operating system fulfils the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to communicating something to his mother-in-law.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but one must think of its 'death', not as an absolute, but as relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is confirming this idea.
People give less attention to the operating system every time, more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run the Firefox, the Explorer or Chrome and every day we spend more time surfing than in the environment of the 'windows'.
What does half of the computer use in existing applications?
Less Is More
And Windows 7 needs to be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Lighter, less exaggerated, less complicated.
The interest of Microsofts is more to integrate its online services, which can then eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need this, without doubt. I give a small example of it.
The photo of this place I made in Redmond, in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
A sign is attached to the refreshing beverage automatic: `Your search. Our future'. It prints out a request to use your own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of the employees of Microsoft, Google, used research on the web.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather even in 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the possibility to simultaneously launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso had it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in `Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in `The Pate' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time, it is part of the clothing of a well-built pastor.
If we start counting the countless stars appearances, we can go back to the image of a very strong man, with a pointed beard that had raised heavy weights in a hiking circus.
Basically, this is a typical male t-shirt made of cotton, sleeveless and waisted.
The English-speaking people call it 'tank'. However, Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles surpasses all other brands.
First of all, because of its great name, although it is called in the narrow circle `Marcel'. The legend tells us that the birth of the name is linked to sport and stems from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
`La Marcel' excels all because of its excellent cotton, because of its distinctive unisex cut and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (narely recognizable) that these T-shirts have as detail on the neckline.
And attention, the Belgian company not only focuses on the production of 'tanks'.
They also have college sweatshirts, boxer retro, cardigans and cashmere, trousers made of cotton, t-shirts with stripes, babes, mini shorts
Modelled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it is very bad to use them as underwear.
They're very attractive.
'I want to be a young mother; I don't worry about the candidate.'
Her great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mondica Cruz is lovely, but full of joy.
At present, the siblings Gruz take their new business very seriously in fashion.
For Mónica, this means much more than for some pretty and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the company Mango, moved her residence and also made the presentation of the most important prizes in fashion that sponsors the Spanish fashion house.
Mercy and shy, winner on short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I have designed for Mango, and I also visited the presentation of the second edition of `Mango Fashion Awards' and took part in dinner to Valentino's honor.
A very intensive working time, which is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, both I am fascinated by the cinema of the 50's and 60's; there we find many ideas.
I would like to go through a city and observe women how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I often do that.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I believe, but finally, everything meets in one and these areas have many similarities.
Since I was little, I was thrilled by the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to roll around my aunt's wardrobes and see her clothes.
That was great going almost better than going to a amusement park.
Later, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to the clothes.
You know, we dancers like it so much to have our own style in classes and at the rehearsals to look into the mirror and feel good at it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you put yourself in the real role.
Finally, everything is connected, it is so, much respect for the costume designer and their professionalism.
You just turned 30, didn't you fall into a crisis?
Oh, shit.
I feel better than ever when I'm 30 years old.
I find that the woman becomes mature, has experience and can enjoy life with less mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological clock.
I've been doing the things I've been doing since I was a kid, and that gave me a lot of inner joy.
So, you think about becoming a mother, don't you?
For a long time now, I have known that I am going to be a mother because that requires my body and also I want to be a young mother; I don't want to miss that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I'm not worried.
I will convey great happiness to my child and educate it with much love.
As far as film art is concerned, you keep in mind the works you took part in and the last year was filmed.
That is exactly the way it is and I very much want it to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theatre, am very impatient and restless and want everything at once, which of course cannot be immediately.
I very much wish that `La última hora' and `En busca de la tumba de Cristo' are performed for the first time.
Let's see how they like you.
A couple of days ago, you appeared on the driveway with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's okay, don't say that.
It's not like I went on the driveway to model.
Naomi Campbell, who I have known for some time, has just called me and invited me to London to attend a parade for the charity event of her organization 'Women for a Better World' and the clothes we show. I know that two pieces of clothes from our collection were auctioned for Mango to collect the money for Naomi’s NGO.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
There's a lot of things being told about them, and I, as the one she knows, would tell you that they're not right.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which she is involved.
She asked me to take part in the parade for this great thing, but if she comes and asks me to make a handstand, I will do the same.
To support women in the Third World, whatever is necessary.
The car drivers, who can fall back because of the alcohol level, will have to install the `Alcolock'.
The authority orders that the driver, who had three official penalties for alcohol levels, install in his car this system, which forbids him to start the car in a drunken state. If he is alcoholized, then the car does not jump.
The initiative has already been announced last month in June and is already part of the report of the Public Prosecutor General's Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last for a year.
The purpose is to re-socialise the driver, which is why he is given a price for re-education of the traffic.
In addition to the Public Prosecutor-General's Office, the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for the Safety of Automobiles will be involved in this.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of drivers, who were shown more than once as a result of driving under alcohol, went back to work.
The `alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the breathed air and prevents the start of the car when the driver has performed the alcohol test; or if an alcohol concentration is found which is higher than permitted.
It costs more than 1 000 euros, the costs are borne by the person who imposes the penalty.
In this context, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that already in the first year after its introduction, equipped cars prevent up to 65% of the regulatory breaches.
In Spain, 115 lives could be saved annually.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to attack this behaviour before it becomes a criminal offence.
And in order to facilitate its implementation, a legal reform can be implemented in the ordinary way, and yet a reform of the basic law is required which is necessary for the prosecution process.
The device is still available on the Spanish markets, in no business, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and vehicles of public transport.
Tomorrow, the House of Representatives will vote on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, which has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 17:40 a.m., at the time planned by the program, next to the presidential hangar of the Benito Juárez de México DF airport, the aircraft of the Spanish Air Force landed with the prince and prince of Asturias.
The sun went down, but their rays were still forced to use the hand as a parasol to see the royal pair that got out of the plane.
Directly on the Gangway: the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities
A few hours earlier, I had asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the prince and the princess of Asturias were visiting the city to formalize the official journey.
- Ah, very good, so there can be no people at the airport at this time you are from here or so
No, she's the Spaniard, but she's lived here for a couple of years.
-Oh, that's very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the prince and the prince of Asturias are and knows the importance of the journey.
There are many waiting in the hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, also military protection of 27 Marine soldiers who give off the ointment of honor.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, with long hairs weaved by the wind, without ordinary 'peep-toes', may have been told that a thunderstorm is expected in DF.
Before entering the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official succession awaits.
At the door of the hotel in which they are housed, one of the four largest in the city, a reporter from Mexican television is waiting for her, who likes to joke.
The best premium of fashion
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no significantly outstanding fashion designer and Bonvivant than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the 'el Bóton-Mango Fashion Adwards' fashion competition for the promotion and international expansion of young fashion talents.
This is awarded with a money price of 300 000 euros.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings yesterday in the showhouse of the Mango branch at Boulevard Haussmann Number 54 in Paris and almost cried because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the company's second largest business in Europe and has recently been opened. It offers a sales area of 1,335 m2.
The largest business is in London.
So many events have happened that are linked to thanking the fashion designer Valentino for his jury chair at the competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the vicinity of many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed to be spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart, which was broken by the pain, because his brother died recently, got torn together. He dressed the suit from the fashion house and had some jewelry from Elah that were stunning. He held himself at the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall and accompanied Valentino at the dinner, to his honor.
Andik, the owner and lord of Mango's house, greeted the guests and was such a cavalier, so he ended up with the baron of Red Shield without jackets, because Jackets they lent to the ladies.
Mondica Cruz, has hurried to the shop and had a trousers and shirt on which she herself modeled, and to the dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. During a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballet samples, so she got excited, remembered the old times, grabbed a bar and made a sort of 'grand plie'.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the palace premises, but before that she showed us the photos of her son on the cell phone.
The next morning, we were able to look forward to the presence of Oliver Martínez, a person who always evokes a stormy enthusiasm, and to Jon Travolta, who, after his arrival (with his own bedclothes and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without smells.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.
1001 advice against stress
There is not a 1000, but one more way to forget about chaotic everyday life.
And if there are few, all are collected in a book where it says how to relax. The book comes into the bookshops on September 30.
The alarm clock is a punishment when it rings at 7 a.m., but even worse the idea seems to come back into the hectic rhythm that demands the current life.
The office means the tension and the computers that lead to back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are no one and not two methods to tackle the daily exhaustion and the problems that are being eliminated from the working world.
But the number increases, no more and no less than 1001.
In addition to yoga poses, classical massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents in the book the whole list of possibilities that are adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress is called `1001 opportunities to relax', and so the calm which the book conveys comes into the bookstores of Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Anyone who believes that it is impossible to achieve peace in areas such as workplaces with the help of personal contacts, then refutes this manual of such faith.
In addition, the methods are offered how to stay in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenaline in your veins no longer rises to restore the body's balance and the stress has become a problem, then the moment has come to sit on the sofa, turn off the brain and focus on reading.
Talking in Sleep
Some children speak at night
I mean not those who wake up and tell us something about what happened the day before, but the children who speak during sleep.
If it happens to you for the first time, in the best case you will be frightened, but in reality it has no meaning.
This is a positive sleep disorder called talking in sleep.
It is quite widespread, especially among children and young people.
Of course, more than one of you was told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (once in life, for example, during the high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the child can remember nothing the next day.
There is no single reason that causes this phenomenon.
Often relationships with other appearances are sought in sleep, such as nightmares, panic anxiety at night, Enuresis noctura (betting noses at night), talking in sleep, but there is no reason.
As we mentioned earlier, it may be very high fiber, stress situations or overburden.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It can be that one speaks quietly in individual words, whispers or it can be quite an opposite (scream, wines, long discussions).
In cases where the expression is very intense, it is recommended that the child be observed and advised by a specialist to check if there is a problem which causes and thus causes anxiety.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it will not be treated, whether it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with the sleep apnoea or with stress).
What you can do is carry out a series of simple prevention measures:
Try not to excite the child before sleeping.
So, quiet game for the child choose and avoid stressful TV programs that are terrible and too wild.
For the nervous children who are recommended for relaxation, relaxation methods can be used to help them get some inner rest.
This helps the child to sleep quietly.
When the speech occurs in sleep once, it tries to maintain peace.
Remember that it is harmless for the child and the next day nothing will be able to remember what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, for the child is unconscious, so you will tear it out of sleep.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it rests.
Remember, if it turns out to be frightened by a few appearances, it is recommended to let yourself be advised or to find out what reason the child is afraid of.
If they understand what it says (which is not so common), the child does not put under pressure to conduct a hearing and obtain more information.
Thus you will not be able to achieve anything because when the child sleeps, it is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Besides, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it is dreaming about and why it says that they are careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions it draws from it.
Maybe, don't tell the child that you hear that night and know his secrets.
Not even joking.
It causes a lot of fear.
So, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's a moment that only lasts a few minutes.
Houses ... finally
After a long stretch of thirst, Illhäusern is finally back on a successful course on the field.
Without great effort, the yellow blacks played many Torchances and managed to implement one of them, thus winning the game.
The pace of this encounter in which the attackers tried to show their ability was not very high.
After a first attack by Gastkapitän Kaufmann, whose telescope passed near the corner, Illhäusern should easily dominate the game, and it succeeded in alternating only Fonderflick with a television shot, then Hirn with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the foot tip to challenge the Danish defenses.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field and left only the lively Riahi at the top of the storm.
The beginning of the second half should be decisive with first two Torchances fought by Riahi and Temporale, and immediately afterwards with the first gate for the Illhäuser through Marais, who stood exactly right to assume a ball that had been defended in a first attempt by Diebold.
But the ill-hausian goalkeeper should not be able to enjoy his luck long and be sent to the bank about twelve minutes later, which forced his teammates to continue to subduing.
Denmark, however, did not take advantage of this and did not face any major problems of an ill-haeutic Elf, who withdrew only a little to 'digest' their defense, except in the very last seconds of the game in which the ball passed very close to the latte after a big mess.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another detour to Brittany.
In view of the determined attitude of fishermen who blocked access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French President decided to meet with their representatives at the port of Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning.
The latter promised to receive him with a constructive spirit and hope that he would come with concrete proposals.
The President's visit takes place at the same time as a General Assembly of the Crisis Committee, which was established by the Breton fishermen to enforce measures in view of the extreme rise in the price of diesel, which has reached a record value of an average of over 1.14 euros per litre.
According to the press spokesperson of the Elyséepalast David Martinon, the President will discuss possible solutions with them to help their businesses become competitive again, and to secure the working conditions and the payment of seafarers.'
Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen with determination.
On Tuesday morning they led protest marches in Morbihan and Calvados, which caused congestion of nearly ten kilometers in length.
Quiberon's sailing port was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not stop.
The Quiberon peninsula was delimited with a barrier.
On Monday the sailors gave expression to their determination by burning tires and pallets from the early morning before the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread on other ports of the Atlantic coast and the Channel of Sables, such as Sables d`Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fishbutter did not go out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the maneuver of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique dissolved the blockade of the important total refinery in Donges in the evening.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the meeting to be held in the Ministry on Wednesday before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the Committee on Crisis in Guilvinec must decide on the reactions to the movement and on its participation in the discussion planned in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the national fisheries committee who did not support their movement.
'The strike will continue', because 'the fishermen will not yield at any point' and 'will not go to Paris', for example Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently cost the liter about 50 cents, but they believe that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman of the Wonderful
The unforgettable actor from `Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died at the age of 83 from the consequences of cancer in his house in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, or Sam Mendes, adopted the cinematic and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer concludes its 2008 delivery forecasts
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft delivered this year, despite the threat of recession, to be a threat to the world economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, holds his 2008 delivery forecasts with 215 aircraft, reaffirmed his president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer supplied 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of size from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider giving up more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times, the Insurer American International Group, which was financially supported by the U.S. Monetary Authority, considers that more than 15% of its assets should be used to repay the 85 billion dollars that were charged to it.
AIG is willing to tax the sale of a large part of its business, beyond its life insurance at international level and its retirement provision in the United States.
According to the FT, the Board of Directors of AIG met on Sunday evening to verify possible sales.
No confirmation could be obtained with the AIG.
Among the assets that AIG might be segregated from are its aircraft leasing-Filiale International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% share in Transatlantic Holdings reinsurers, as well as its real estate assets and investments in private equity, the FT continues to explain.
As regards these sales, no final decision was taken, the FT continues.
AIG must act as quickly as possible in order to repay the loans over 85 billion which it has granted to the Federal Reserve, including the risk that the US authorities will receive 80% of their capital and the current shareholders will be lost to the same extent.
Analysis Historical Paris of the meeting Historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported on Monday after the Chamber of Representatives had rejected Paulson's plan to rescue the banks, a historical case of courses: The Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of nearly 800 points, and Nasdag 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has dropped by 777,68 points to 10,365,45 points.
With regard to the points, the strongest case of its history (684.81 points) was recorded earlier on 17 September 2001, the day of the trade decline following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
According to the final rejection figures, the Nasdag index, mainly concerning technology, has dropped by 199.61 points to 1,983.73, and the widely used Standard&Poors 500 index by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
After the unexpected rejection of the plan to rescue the banks by the Chamber of Deputies, which was to restore stability in the markets, Wall Street collapsed, which had already been beaten at the beginning of the quarter.
By 228 votes against and 205 abstentions, the Members denied the funds he had requested to the Secretary of Finance, Henry Paulson.
Almost two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
`A bad picture is circulated here, which makes the congress incapable of adopting a plan', said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
'This shows how much the market counted on this plan', added it, and fears that a project adopted in several days 'too late' will come.
`If the project is actually condemned to fail (...), it will soon be the task of the Fed (the US Central Bank, Note D. Red.) and other central banks to deal with the crisis, which would limit the credit conditions even more', Brian Bethune, chief economics at Global Insight warned.
And Ms. Piegza stressed, while raising the feeling of extreme urgency, 'that every day that ends brings the ruin of a financial corporation to the United States'.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the American authorities planned to purchase the bank operations of Wachovia by its competitors Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated and thus led to emergency measures in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, in the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, indicating that the markets are not just facing an American but a global crisis, the analyst of the FTN Financial added.
The market for basic consumer goods has grown strongly.
The government's revenue within ten years has fallen from 3.632% to 3.827% on Friday evening, and revenue within 30 years of evening from 4.161% to 4.357% on Friday evening.
Obama, winner by points in the first television screen
At the first debate of the two candidates for the White House of Friday another followed to find out who emerged as the winner of it, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, QGs announced their own victory in this television campaign, which was to be followed by a third of the American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, although quite handsome, was not 'brillant' enough to enable him to stop his decline in the polls five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, of which a five-point poll was published on Saturday (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that the democracy clearly makes the better figure.
In the still undecided voters, that is to say, those to whom it now comes, Obama emerged with 39% as the winner of the polls, while according to a CBS survey, 25% of them see McCain as the winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected by his competitor Joseph Biden at the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin
'It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts, but warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain did not stop putting his indisputable experience in the field of foreign policy in the foreground, and in doing so clearly underline the 'neighbourliness' of his opponent with regard to these issues, which were the focus of this first television dual.
`Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that...', he emphasized several times.
'I don't think Senator Obama has the necessary experience and the necessary knowledge to become President', he also assured me.
An attack point that has been preached in Republican election spots since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He expressed himself briefly and precisely, without being put to the vote.
He put his ability to make good decisions and to renew the image of the United States world.
'McCain has still not understood, but Obama has already', this weekend opposed a democratic election campaign campaign in which Republicans were accused of not having recorded the full extent of the crisis that is being imposed on the 'American from the street'.
`During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you', Obama yesterday appealed to 20,000 people who had gathered in streaming rain on the occasion of an election event in North Carolina.
He did not even mention the words 'middle' or 'workers'. 'The financial crisis gives Obama, whom Americans consider most suitable to save the economy even on the edge of the abyss, a clear advantage.
`The coming week could be a crucial turning point', estimated yesterday by the influential democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
The democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the government of Clinton, compared the 'good economic instincts' Obamas with those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidates, the current crisis is 'the final judgment of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain'.
After once again stressing that he would even manage to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite fluctuations on Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois pointed out that the creation of possible energy independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energies, together with the introduction of a health insurance system, were his top priority.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a 45-power plant by 2030.
The two candidates considerately address the questions raised in the plan to save the financial market over 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros), which was adopted by the Congress yesterday evening and which is extremely unpopular with the people.
`Did you notice that a choice was made in Minsk?'
Young people and oppositionals demonstrated Sunday evening on the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening since the closing of the polls in the Minsk marketplace to protest against the fraudulent character of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result had yet been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: 'The dictator shall resign'.
Some admit that they didn't choose at all: 'What good is it if they do with my voice what they want,' says one youth.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown itself to be in the best light to foreign observers to resume negotiations with the European Union, is ready to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-return of visas for 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the raising of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were deemed clean by the observers.
According to the opposition, they were not.
'We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the numeration', lamented Juri Potemkin, the press spokesperson of the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous merger of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, emphasizes Alexander Milinkievich, a former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the Pro-Europe movement, because it is important who counts the votes, and with us this is the executive.
If members of the opposition move to Parliament because they have been appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can mean broadcasting time on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals. '
The opposition is therefore guilty of getting involved in the political game, because 'dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, is in crisis and we do not reform, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent.
The opposition fears that the European Security and Cooperation Organisation, which has followed the electoral process, does not recognise the election as valid.
It emphasises that the electoral participation figures appear too high, and that the extension of the voting fee in advance (26% of the voters of Minsk) has paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
`Did you notice that a election took place? ask the leader of the social democrat Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners who were released in August of this year.
Nobody was in the polls.
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in Parliament, those who are closest to the government's ideas.
The silence of the night recedes again over the October square.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulated on their success.
Discussion - From blood that has been safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated yesterday the 10th anniversary of her founding, and her president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, it regained public confidence, which was shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As we know, the national blood reserves administered by the blood donation service of the Canadian Red Cross were contaminated with the HI virus and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In view of this drama and public dissatisfaction, in February 1994 the Government of Canada launched a public investigation led by Judge Horace Krever, aimed at bringing light to the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and working out guidelines to prevent a further disaster of this kind.
While Judge Krever was still reluctant to report, several provinces then set up a committee to develop a new system for the administration of blood preserves in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mission.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, who is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood company to provide the other provinces and the two territories.
`1998, when Hema-Quebec started working, hardly 38% of people had confidence in the blood-staining system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood preserves and through the work in this area over the following years, we have regained public confidence', she says, before she proudly emphasises that by the beginning of 2008 almost 94% of the population of Quebec had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
However, Dr. Décary keeps aware that 'trust is something extremely fragile'.
Since its founding on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has acted on the principle of caution.
At this time, we experienced the occurrence of numerous cases of the human form of bovine madness in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, tells this woman, who has been in charge since its founding in 1998.
`And we didn't have the slightest idea whether this disease could be transmitted over the blood.
So we called for one of the main guidelines of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, which says that exclusion is applied if you do not know this and if a disease progresss only slowly, as it is apparently the case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is expressed by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
So in April 1999 no blood was taken from people who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, without any doubt, it was proved that this disease was transmitted over the blood.
So this event has shown us that the principle of caution we were applying is quite meaningful.
In 1999 a much more precise technique for detection of HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid tests (NST), which enable the virus to be detected directly in the donor’s blood, and not the antibody against the virus, as was the case with the tests previously used.
The NST allowed to shorten the incubation time between the time the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected by our techniques in the blood, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to less than a week.
Thus, the risk that certain donors might be infected without knowing it and one could not recognize it was significantly reduced.
These improvements made it possible to reduce significantly the risk of transmitting AIDS via a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people is at risk of receiving HIV - infected blood.
`In other words, you would have to distribute 12 million blood preserves before someone would be infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood canisters each year, it would take more than 24 years before a case occurs in which HIV was transmitted via a blood canister.
I think you can feel comfortable today when you get or write a blood transfusion to restore your health', says the director of Hema-Quebec.
`Our challenge for the next ten years is to get the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen can get into the system.
Only last year has the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the Western Nile virus, is transmitted by insects over the blood.
We have to keep monitoring', Dr. Décary continues before stressing that Hema-Quebec must also provide a sufficient supply in addition to a secure supply.
`The need is increasing because the population is ageing.
Since anticancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood-supplier network, which averages only 3% of Quebec's blood-supplier population.
Every healthy person who is 18 years of age or older and who meets the fitness criteria can donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of the people who supply their blood are not expected to be ill with AIDS or malaria, for example, and those who have travelled to a country where malaria is spread are excluded from the donation for one year.
`With this 3%, we manage to obtain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Missing supplies are very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network when they get older and can no longer donate blood.
It is hard to convince people to donate blood, but above all, to keep it and to make them regular donors.
Life is so hectic nowadays that you rarely find the time to spend an hour in blood donation', Francine Décary regrets.
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars, Hema-Quebec supplies not only blood preserves but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which are used almost exclusively in severe burns.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public cord bank in Quebec.
In the umbilical cord, considered earlier to be biomedical waste, there is rich blood on stem cells that can help treat severe diseases, such as leukaemia.
A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our thousands of cord blood samples, and we are planning to drop more than a thousand annually.
`We should probably start making it available for transplants at the beginning of next year', Dr. Décary further explains, which describes this program as very popular for the removal of navel cord blood.
'Many mothers are convinced not to have access to it', because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costly program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in semi-finals
Montreal’s impact yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1 win (4 to 3 with all goals) against the Seattle Sounders at the second and decide the game of the quarter final series in the Saputo Stadium, where the overall goal ratio was to qualify for the semi-final round of the U.S.L.’s first league.
The middle field player Antonio Ribeiro shot the crucial goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a first half-time without goal for both the one and the other, the midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other matches for the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who put Matt Jordan in the way for the Sounders.
Let's remember that during the first game of the pre- and replay series on Friday Impact, the Starfire Complex in Tukwila in a suburb of Seattle had brought a 2 to 1 down.
In the semi-finals, impact will be measured with the Vancouver whitecaps.
On Saturday evening Thunder was able to balance a 3 to 1-deficit with a 4 to 3 win in the back game in Minnesota, but the Whitecaps went into the semi-final round with a total gate ratio of 5 to 4 yet.
Impact will probably have to face the Whitecaps Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series will be set today.
In short - Victory by Kovalev
The number 1 trio of the Canadian team is ready to attack the season.
Last night, the unit formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn advanced the attack on the Panthers from Florida with a storm fire, leading to a 3 to 2 win.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, shot a gate, Plekanec delivered two templates and Kovalev turned a pass in this victory game, the fourth of the tricolors into six preparatory games.
Kovalev won by shooting the only gate of the entire shooting.
'I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
I need another game to make me feel good.'
`He got too caught up in the first half of the year, said Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He got stormy applause.
Charest sets on the north
The Prime Minister does not rule out the opening of elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the General Assembly of the Liberal Party came to an end, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left) tries to be elected in today's partial elections.
`Move the course of our last big border to the north': This is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday with visual means at the General Assembly of the liberal party of Quebec in Levi, where he followed entirely the guidelines.
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric plants, mines, looked from Quebec in `Google Maps', maps, etc.
Large funds, such as during the term of office.
In contrast to the press, the Prime Minister refused, by the way, to exclude him from holding the elections this autumn, even if he had been told that his schedule was very full.
The 'Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a 'Vision', which the Prime Minister allegedly has for Quebec, namely the 'new economic space', which provides for agreement with France on labour, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has recently been frequently mentioned in the speeches of the Prime Minister, the opening of the North - the northern part of the 49th degree - has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister limited himself to explaining why the North was 'a jewel with enormous potential', but did not mention a date, no investment sums or precise priorities for the projects to come.
Most of the prospects for what could be done more: above all, water, the forest, but especially the mining sector, favoured by the growth of emerging economies and the renewal of public infrastructures.
According to Mr. Charest's census, the north has `Nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'.
This `area twice as large as France`is in our vicinity, is in Quebec.
It is not only in our vicinity, it is in us', he stressed how to show clearly that he is seeking to achieve a national founding dream.
Quebec has grown very much through its connection with the north, he stressed: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technique of Quebec, the James book.
'It belongs to us, it is our future', he added after he had put in a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of the Quebec area, includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always requested, declared the prime minister of the press.
`This is a traditional attitude that all governments followed.
There is a borderline where there has been no agreement for a very long time when the opportunity arises, and I will take this position again on behalf of the government,' he said.
In addition, 'with climate change, we need to rethink our vision from the north', he explained and spoke about the Northwest Passage, which due to the meltdown will be traversable all year round.
In the face of this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is precisely a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the land, the natives, and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the government of Quebec would deal with them very carefully, and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former specialist ungava) have already started discussions with about thirty communities.
A ministerial committee led by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Land Treasures) takes an important place, took up the work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large assembly, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity where 'you will create a common vision'.
The development of the North will, moreover, take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be 'discussed, regulated and environmentally friendly', he promised.
Jean Charest described this 'vision' as if it were a continuation of the liberal prime minister who was in front of him.
Like the Liberals who were in front of us, we have changed our minds to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.
By the way, this was one of the recurring topics of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a big cocktail party for the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the takeover of the party leadership by Jean Lesage.
One of the decisions adopted provides for the conversion of Beauharnois' power plant to Adélard-Godbout-Stauddamm.
`From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, about Lesage, who has reached the silent revolution and the nationalization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James book, our party always knew how to determine the future', Jean Charest explained.
He addressed the press to another conservative project this time, referring to the 'roads to the North' program by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the project hydropower dam Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr Charest emphasises that its commissioning was scheduled for 2012.
`This remains among us, but I intend to be there', he entrusted his party members with what was a result of those applause storms.
In fact, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly also in 2009, has not yet been excluded from this autumn's election, which is possible from the law.
He stressed, however, that his calendar was full, mainly because of a mission of the Council of Europe in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The Weekend General Assembly provided the Liberal Party Head with a platform of nationalistic plans, mainly from 'the constitutional objectives', which were adopted without further notice: the PLQ specifically calls for the recognition of the 'speciality of Quebec' in the Constitution.
It would also like Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to have a veto regarding the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, the guidelines of the North Plan were taken up with scepticism.
The head of Québécois, Pauline Marois, has reiterated the policy for the development of the North-du-Quebec, which the Landry government introduced in 2001.
According to you, when the liberal government came to power in 2003, it refused to apply it.
If she had done so, we'd be much further today', Ms. Marois judged at the side of her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election takes place today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ is committed to supporting the adoption of a North Plan by the government.
`But what we want is that this will not only be a great idea,' said the party leader Sébastien Proulx in representation for Mario Dumont, who is coming back from the holiday today.
Letters - A Entrepreneured Country
Mr. Vic Toews, ex-'Justiz' minister (who irony) in the cabinet of Harper was the one who last summer allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour that she was a 'damage' for Canada.
This woman, who has waged an unending struggle for justice and deserves all our admiration, so to speak, to cover with shame, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government which, as the only country concerned, has not brought home its countryman trapped in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a youth when the things that are being accused of happened to him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and causes a child soldier to wade away under inhumane conditions.
The only ones who turn to a judicial parody in order to assess the defendant's guilt.
Let us remember that, above all, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the association of Canadian lawyers are pleading to bring Omar Khadr home so that he can get a fair trial in Canada.
This same government also closes its eyes to torture: they are not interested in the fact that after so many years a young adult will certainly have been mentally broken for all time.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are experiencing a hideous circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word that Harper constantly carries before him like a flag, and that sounds so unspeakable from his mouth.
The time has therefore come when there is no more morality: a Canadian citizen may be arbitrarily abused, tortured and imprisoned, according to the wishes of a head of government, who is still only supported by the minority (may he be a minority after 14 October...).
Many voters believe to find their salvation in a party that preaches virtue, law and order, but they do not see that this government has renounced what made up the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, lies in this discharge, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwellian Speech of Barrick Gold
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Deputy Director General of the Canadian Gold Mine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, and pursues an orwell-based logic that the world's largest gold-gathering society sought to open up a 'public transparent debate' over six million charges against three authors and a small, mediocre publishing house.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of slanderous charges, but the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely obscured by Mr Garver.
For Barrick Gold is the best way to conduct a public debate, to drive anyone into the ruin who dares to represent one of their opposite views.
No matter how the process goes, the authors and editors of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers paid out of the nearly inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine.
Moreover, the tactics of these unequal struggles are often to ruin the defenders in order to force a unanimous arrangement which causes the opposite to die and also deters anyone who dares to re-examine the question.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have had to present her view of things before the public opinion.
In contrast to what is going on and going on in many countries where Barrick is Gold, debates are usually held in Canada by exchanging ideas and not by bumpers.
It would therefore have been sufficient if the gold mine had disclosed its books and documents and opened a real debate, through the newspapers, the media, publications and the financing of independent investigation teams, which could have brought this issue to light.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and wipes the petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement aside.
Could Mr Garver perhaps explain how he can at the same time ask for a 'public' debate and, at the same time, ignore the opinions of this public?
It seems that this word in the world of Vice-President only includes generously paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a very narrow view of the term.
In a democracy, even slanderers have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public who supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada does so mainly because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many perceive as a gag (in the course of the 'public debate' Barrick Gold has just addressed a request to the authors of Noir Canada in which they demand that they no longer use this term...).
Apart from Mr. Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's lawsuit is a direct attack on freedom of academic research and truth that are fundamental to any democratic society.
It completely denies the right to quote credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to explore and discuss issues that do not please the rich company of this world, then who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could lead it by following the scientific norms used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment we belong to has long been aware of getting hold of debates and disagreements and resolving conflicts.
The disproportionate charge of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, contrary to what it says, it does not desire a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate, and it is time for governments to take measures to limit this kind of unjustified complaint.
Rescue for Wall Street Democrats and Republicans
The Bush administration and the leading congressmen, Republicans and Democrats alike finally reached agreement on the most extensive economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan, over $700 billion, which is supposed to stop the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months, still needs to be adopted by the two Congressional Chambers.
The main elements are: better control of the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to secure the repayment of the public funds used, new provisions to limit the number of houses planted due to delays in payment, and the right to monitor the salaries paid to managers of the aided enterprises.
American financial secretary Henry Paulson, the president of the Chamber of Deputies Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative present at the negotiations, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiating marathon.
'We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be market-effective', said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
'It all happened to protect the real economy and the American people from the course crisis on Wall Street', explained the democrat.
`This is the fundamental point: If we don't do this, the trauma, chaos and unrest in the daily lives of the Americans will be enormous', declared Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had accelerated over the last two hours because of the fear of the effect that a new failure would have had on investors' moods.
The deadline agreed was the opening of the market this morning.
The two American presidential candidates, who were only late in the negotiations, showed themselves rather as supporters of the agreement, but without failing to express their dissatisfaction at the fact that they had to be met in this extreme way.
The Democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted on the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, in particular those intended to enable owners to keep their homes, and those relating to the salaries of the senior employees of the companies saved by the State.
'If you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the responsibilities of certain people, that is nothing to be congratulated on.
But these measures are necessary', he explained on the American television channels.
When he was asked on another station whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: `I would like to know the details first, but I hope so.
`The guidelines that I have read [show] that this is one thing that we all need to digest, and with which we will be able to advance.
The option of not doing anything is simply not acceptable', he said.
The 700 billion dollar plan is aimed at using the taxpayers' money
It comes 14 months after a crisis triggered by the placing of a real estate bubble, which initially led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans (subprime), before it extended to further forms of widespread bonds (PCAA), and eventually into freezing of financial power and into the ruin of banks and financial institutions.
A group of Republican MPs failed last week's first attempt to reach agreement.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain 'poisonous' assets of societies should only be secured by the government and not be bought, it is believed that the dead end will escape.
To round off the perspective for all in Congress, one has also added an option that says that, if the government were to make losses with this program within five years, it could then raise new taxes in order to retain its invested capital.
The new plan envisages the payment of a first sum of 250 billion to which another 100 billion can be added, if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion must be adopted in a new vote by the Congress.
In return for his help, Washington receives shares in the supported companies that bring him dividends in the case of winnings and that can sell it again when the storm has passed.
The Federal Government will have the possibility of suspending the settlement procedures relating to the dwellings linked to the real estate loans covered by this plan and also to set deadlines for the repayment and settlements paid to the senior employees of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of Deputies to vote on it today, and the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get green light.
In fact, there were still other votes against this project yesterday, both by the Republicans and by the Democrats.
'All obviously Washington doesn't understand us', declared Republican Scott Garett, member of the Board's Finance Commission, his constituents.
'Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not those who are asking taxpayers to pay the check-in.'
Democratic MEP Brad Sherman, head of a group in Congress called 'the Caucasian of Skeptics', presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
'Four hundred excellent business professors, including three Nobel Laureates, have written us to inform us: We are asking the Congress not to be pressured, and to think carefully about which way is going', he explained yesterday.
At the same time, we in Europe again received evidence that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refrain from buying up its competitor who is in great difficulty since losing 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) in the crisis due to the risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the 20 largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
'This is not a lost money, yesterday the Dutch finance minister Wouter Bos explained.
To offset this, we get a right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what savers and households appreciate, now that uncertain times are coming to light.
During this time, on the other side of the Channel, the British government was about to put another bank under pressure from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans from the Bank Bradford and Bringley, of which over 41 billion (75.5 billion US dollars) from real estate loans.
The Spanish Bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy up the branches and customer accounts of the British Bank.
According to Northern Rock, Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank that the British government has had to govern since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a dedicated icon
His beauty with the azure blue eyes was his trump for a long time, no one would say his weakness.
Did the American actor escape from the narcissistic mirror with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His delicate feeling, his sensitivity and an obvious talent have also kept him away from a position of power that brings the truly terrible monsters to the world.
But what a great permanent runner!
On Friday at the age of 83, Paul Newman, who died of lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, for whom he resembled and for which he was for a long time a kind of rival on the canvas, more carefully in his play, certainly also more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the bombardment of dramatic Turkish conventions.
Mixed blood often results in wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian mother.
One of the glorious faces of the American dream should emerge from its European roots.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality.
Because in him a whole country, in love with the Self-made man, reflected itself in the fighter who was injured in the Pacific war, who studied acting in Yale at the beginning of the 50s and then went to the Actor's studio in New York before he had success at the theatre, on television and soon in cinema.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also the driver who was in 1979 at the 24 hour race of Man's second, and also a sex symbol, even though he lived in a show-off relationship with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With it, the unknown facets of this mysterious, restraining, engaged and hypersensitive star, whose mystery will never be solved completely, disappear.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman put cinema lovers in twilight this weekend, while all his big roles were played on the dark screen of memories.
More than half a century of American film art is constantly changing with him.
The charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) once again pushes into memory, and the young man who returns his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) to Die Katze on the hot sheet roof, which was filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
It will wake up a much shorter-backed memory (1990), which is disturbed by a wedding that did not fulfill all its promises to his sensitive Mr. Bridge at his old age.
There were so many other Paul Newmans in the course of history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (a hand full of dirt) by Robert Wise, a role that was intended for James Dean after his death was taken up again and the Newman announced correctly in 1956.
This sympathetic ganov in the outstanding The Sting (The Clou), which was awarded the Oskar for the best film in 1973.
As a bitter and rich billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
This face through the times, he was.
Still him.
In his resume, epochs unite.
The youth knows him mainly from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Brothers Coen in 1994.
With a final role in 2003 as a pat of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes, the circle joined.
In contrast to several cinematographers who withdrew early enough from the film world, Newman should remain in the saddle for a long time, thereby betraying Hollywood, his fortune, his prank and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to the 'underplaying' when he judged his all too expressive achievements.
The Metier was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles for a long time just flew.
However, he rarely played Sunnyboys as an outsider: neurotic, alcoholic, fiddle or desperate, with whose perfect representation he reflected his slide and his rebellion.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown aspects of his real sensitiveness.
His Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (after the novel by the Canadian woman Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, recorded a subtle women's portrait full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott by an overdose, dedicated his film Harry and Son, a work full of sensitivity and sadness.
In the flood of honours that took place yesterday about Newman, his close friend and former weapons companion Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) explained: `His present has improved my life and this country.'
Splendidness and joy of life were essential characteristics of the dead actor.
Apart from his legendary career, there is now also a great defender of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of Hollywood's abduction.
We may have seen him standing in a bowl with his foot full of vinaigrette, in sauces, pastries, or other foods, and thought this was rather tasteless, even though we at first found it funny.
The profits from his sales nevertheless flowed into his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman committed himself to shooting.
He left his five daughters a letter with these sentences: `Always and until the very end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here."
And it was an honor for us to pursue the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest sense and in the widest sense.
What was produced in the invoice factory by supplement &amp; Co.?
On October 8th, negotiations will begin in the criminal proceedings against Jáno's surcharge and his accomplices.
In particular, the defendant is accused of participation in organised crime, grossly negligent damage and commercial fraud, and other criminal acts, including forgery of documents.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the funds withdrawn from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often charged with fake invoices.
State funds and subsidies from the self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - are partly to be transferred to the funds of the Fiatal Ballidal organization, partly to the private funds of individuals.
As the investigation authorities announced, fictitious invoices were submitted when the tender fees were collected, and the associations should not have complied with their obligations either.
According to the charges, most of the invoices were faked.
The invoice blocks were purchased on the market of Józsefváros, the round seal was made in Kiskunas.
The decision on which companies to issue the invoices was taken on that tour north of Lake Platten, to which István Lados was sent by János supplement.
In the course of this "exploration tour", Lados should find pensions and restaurants.
He requested invoices on consumption in order to be able to issue invoices for the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour and the self-government of Budapest later on.
These invoices are to have been manipulated by the majority of István Lados and his accomplice András ?ri, the latter being responsible for the constitution of the relevant reports according to our information.
One of Lados' "exploration tour" goals was a beer room.
As two invoices issued by supplement and co in 2003 can be found, the catering company is to host the ninety-member group of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
But now the manager of the farm states that such a large group would not have suddenly entered the premises.
Another invoice, issued in summer 2002 at the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also showed serious mistakes in form and content.
In a guest house in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and can not accommodate more than ten people at the same time, 130 guests should have stayed, according to the bill.
The imagination of the account counterfeiters was apparently not as limited as it was about the Pigal Kft., a catering company, in whose accounting documents of the customers Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá did not appear at all, according to the prosecution authority.
As Managing Director Győző Farkas informed Hvg.hu, he immediately realized that these were fake documents when he was presented by the Public Prosecutor during a survey.
"Our company name and tax number were wrong on the stamp."
And further: Apart from faults of form, the fact that the company must have accommodated one hundred people after having eleven rooms in total, which are impossible to accommodate.
Also mentioned on the bill was catering, in which the restaurant was no longer in service for a long time.
The responsible account counterfeiters have also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency they visited only offers travel abroad, and so they stated Hungary travel on the cash bill, which was also contrary to the accounting practice of the company.
In addition, as has been reported in the course of the investigations, they also pointed to VAT, although VAT is free from VAT on travel agency services relating to a country outside the EU.
The total amount of VAT was wrong on four invoices issued by the Hotel Révfürlufen Kft. to the Foundation Jobb Jövőért, since the company is charged with only 15 per cent VAT instead of 25 and only machine invoices are issued by the employees, but the fake documents were handwritten.
Another mistake that had been made by the "accounting armies" was that in a case of "good transport" they had declared service provided, although this is not offered by the company specialised in investment advice, the prosecution informed.
Further errors of form - incorrect invoice format, false stamp - were due to the fact that the invoices issued to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as to XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be revealed as counterfeits.
Also in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sports camp Kunfehértó, whose managing directors had to never issue the invoices.
Another "miss" is the falsification of the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: this society was in dissolvation at the time (2001) when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület should have eaten there - the mass administrator therefore indicated that the bills should not have been issued by itself.
Known forged
The other group of accountants are people who were quite aware that they would have to settle fictitious bills.
At the request of the Fiatal Ballidal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation has issued invoices for the Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Foundation, at a level of approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the Managing Director of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, for the exhibition of fictional invoices.
The Biogate Kft, which is currently also in liquidation, will also have worked with supplement and co.: In 2003 the GmbH will have supplied the Stiftung Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány, as well as the associations Atlas Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesület with counterfeit invoices in the total value of HUF 5 million, which relate to unsolicited services.
However, there was also little payment traffic, as the invoices were cancelled immediately after their issue, which the parties concerned forgot to mention in their documents.
The third group of accountants shall include persons directly associated with the defendants.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian manager of Delta Trió Kft., a company based in Budapest, but not located there.
This company is expected to have issued several invoices for the sale of IT components in the total value of HUF approximately 18 million between October and December 2005.
According to the investigation authority, the cash investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas has been a buyer of these invoices since 14 September 2005 in liquidation.
The managing director of this company was a Romanian company to which the company documents should also be submitted by Iván Kubatov between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Cubatov has been exhibiting invoices on behalf of the GmbH. to the clubs Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and having collected its own counterpart value.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. as well as the Jos-Investment Bt. should have been founded by Romanian Maurers on Iván Kubatov's express request.
In truth, however, none of these companies were active, which according to defendant was due to lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: At the request of his complicity, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was responsible for preparing the company's founding documents, he issued invoices to the associations associated with the award, such as Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
In total, Kubatov has issued 15 invoices in the total value of HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organisations.
The public prosecutor assumes that Cubatov could have collected 10% of the invoice sum as well as VAT.
Cubatov is said to have even abused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of fictitious invoices - in this case the invoices were deposited with the applications of Biztos Pont.
The company Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications in January 2006 to the non-profit organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 forints, but benefited from these amounts for non-profit purposes.
To hide this, they submitted five fictional bills to the TMA of Works Team Kft.
By the way, these invoices were secured during the search of the office of Árpád Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
In the course of the negotiations, some defendants are charged with a confession of the way in which they have been falsified before the prosecution.
A sensation could be if the main defendant Jáno's award was a complete confession.
His previous information was less detailed, and although he had promised to report extensively on everything, his confession is still pending.
The question remains, therefore, whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have concluded a pact with him on the reparation of the bulk of the damage caused by HUF 50 million, and whether the grant is ready to take responsibility in return.
However, it is quite possible that strike now plays the "injured" after his attempts to alleviate the detention and house arrest had been hit on deaf ears.
While other criminals, who have done far greater damage to economic crimes and have not paid them, are on the loose, or at least under house arrest, this possibility is denied.
The psychology of oversupply - or why we are willing to pay more
In the case of auctions, buyers tend to spend more and therefore overvalue the fault bid.
Neurologists and business researchers at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological-economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behaviour.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people do not want to give themselves in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even excessive prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
A group of volunteers should play Lotto, while the others participated in a playful action - in both cases the active brain regions of the subjects were investigated by means of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
The participants were able to win money at both games, but an increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the brain cortex, was measured in the event of the auction’s failure, in which the opponent’s excess played an important role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-reward" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore said that the price increase was explained by avoiding overreaction to the striatum.
In order to substantiate their thesis, economists in the research group have also carried out investigations to track the money.
In this case, three groups should compete against a partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, after which they made their contributions.
Another group was also promised 15 dollars of reward, in case they emerge as winners from the game.
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, which were also lost in the event of a lost game.
So the difference between the two groups was simply that the emphasis on the one was on winning, while the other was on losing.
However, as evidence of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, the members of the "counter the losing" group were prepared for higher stakes than those of the control or "win" group.
"These results cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
In fact, these have so far been the reasons for the behaviour observed at auctions only with the joy of winning, or risk avoidance.
The contradiction between these two theories was resolved thanks to the imaging neurological methods, so that we now have a third explanation prepared" - said Andrew Schotter, Professor of the Faculty of Economics of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should the doctor visit?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of people infected is estimated at a hundred thousand in this country, but only seven thousand are treated, which is because the patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for various virus-induced infectious liver disease.
The symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and diseases differ.
Depending on the pathogens, hepatitis viruses spread in two different ways: in hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g. through contaminated food or water), in hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted through blood and other body fluids (such as sperm, cleavage or saliva).
Travellers are recommended to immunise the viruses A and B at least, there is no vaccine against the virus C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A occur approximately two to three weeks after consumption of contaminated food and are generally accompanied by malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and vomiting.
Then yellow fever appears on the skin and in the eyes, the chair becomes bright, the urine darkens, and the recovery can last up to two-three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million people die every year from diseases such as liver cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only every 10 people infected are treated with medication.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: it can lead to untreated liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, as the pathogen destroys the liver cells in a debilitating manner - in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular checks, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease is more common: those who have undergone a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattooed.
At present, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease is already detectable in a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to visit the hospital doctor at the first signs of unknown origin.
In a timely manner, the disease is curable, the virus can be eradicated, thus banaging the risk of infection and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30th is the World's Day of Hepatitis, first organized in 2004 by patient representatives worldwide.
The aim of the action is to raise awareness of this chronic inflammation of the liver caused by viruses, their development and the importance of early detection.
Do Believers Have Less Pain?
As the latest research shows, religious faith acts like a kind of "painful agent" that must have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment: It has been investigated to what extent belief in God affects human pain, reported the British newspaper "Telegraph".
During the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists received electric shocks each while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
As the results showed, the believers were able to eliminate much of the pain.
Even brain scan technology has shown that Catholics have been able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for pain control.
The study was the first in a research project in which scientists, in addition to philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university, participate.
During the test, a sparkling device was attached to the left hand, which the electric shocks gave off.
The participants were asked to focus strongly on two paintings: on the one hand, a picture of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and on the other, Leonardo da Vinci's "Dame with Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the vision of the Virgin Mary would produce a kind of religious trance among the faithful, while they chose da Vinci's image, because it was hardly different from the other painting and felt calming.
The test subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and received a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages during that time, while they should either view the religious, or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that they felt "in security" at the sight of the Mother of God as if they were "careful" and felt "peace and peace".
While viewing the religious painting, they reported more than 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo's work in mind.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, said that similar effects could also be produced among the atheists with other highly active images, but only the corresponding photo would have to be found.
"We would have to find an image that triggered very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father," says the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"Practifying the faith should change our personality, and does so in many cases," says Wright.
After these excellent results only remains the question of what effect a Madonna image Leonardos or another similar painter would have on pain control of the faithful.
Would the quality virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You are what you say about yourself.
On the occasion of their tenth birthday, Google can rightly claim that it is in people's pockets as well as above their heads in heaven: she knows where people have spent their holidays, to which specialists they go, and what moves them.
And that's not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google's managing directors.
In the direction of skeptics, who are plagued by Orwellian horror visions, he lets them set out: These would overlook the very essence of the Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said that the main goal of Google was to collect even more personal data about the users and thus to get closer to the company's original goal, according to which she wanted to "order all information of this world".
Schmidt said that after ten years of work changing the world, Google was still at the beginning of the information collection.
Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said: he wanted Google to be able to answer questions like "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What job really suits me?" but not yet able to answer software programs because they didn't know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that in the course of their internet searches the search terms would be registered, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched, and the pages visited.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to store his own search process and to use it later so that the hits can be generated much more precisely later, and the same logic also relies on the so-called "Recommendations", with which the system recommends tailored products and services based on previous preferences.
However, users wonder what happens in the event of a data abuse - "If you look at what I'm doing" - some are concerned about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is more of the company’s represented potential power that acts intimidatingly, and less of the guilt or fear of punishment, the striving for freedom or the reluctance to reject the power that is in the hands of many Internet users.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored but also passed on to third parties in the event of an incident, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A parade example of this was recently the action against pedophilia in Brazil, in the course of which Google provided information to the Brazilian government, which was collected by the community site called "Orkut", and also enabled the pedophilia to be identified.
However, users concerned with personal rights could still breathe in May, when Google, together with the civil rights organisation EFF, successfully filed a lawsuit against the FBI: that way, Google cannot be forced to release information to the FBI on secret request in the future.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully generated the issue of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms, referring to the Youth Protection Act adopted last year, but the list of individual users, or their web and search terms, has been withheld for two months.)
Google's image thus remains controversial: those who do not disclose their personal data because they fear the loss of their privacy and privacy by using the Google services, the company has to contend with the revolt due to the conservatively performing companies.
However, the American geek culture, which is present in many countries and is enthusiastic about computer fans, activists and users, sees the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, as opposed to Microsoft, which is thanks to Windows market leaders, even though both are fighting for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that in contrast to Microsoft, Google does not require identification codes and provides its services free of charge, so that an open, constantly updated source code and program package appear to be far more attractive, youthful and cooler than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the Geeks see the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet, a relationship that has been brought to the fore especially in recent years thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
For "Web 2.0" is nothing other than collaboration, that is to say, users leave deliberately traces and use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are individually different, the main thing remains to show themselves publicly.
An average youth can manage his profile at the same time on several community portals - from Facebook via Xanga, it can connect with other services, such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can eventually integrate all of this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can provide blogs that automatically represent the latest photo galleries that are located on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other exemplary cases prove: When considering the party photos of last night, the girlfriend will soon find out who has enjoyed her unfaithful friend, or the employee will be released because in his blog he makes only too honest his anger about the management of the company air - one thing is certain: the term "privacy" has now been completely reinterpreted.
Anyone who leads an online life is what he says about himself - you could put the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And who tries to keep something secret, or even bypass Google's monopoly, can do that - like with Scroogle, a tool that does access Google's search engine, but intentionally does not leave any traces.
Not a few people deliberately do not register on community sites so that they are not inventable, but also the online applications of Google, such as word processing and graphical tools and RSS feeds, can be handled with alternative versions that are not bound to huge server parks and therefore also not generate the best possible profile from the user.
The public opinion, however, waits for Google to show her true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even facing IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising sites threaten the revenue of advertising agencies, and the increasingly fast-implemented services not only cause Microsoft but also other software developers to break their minds.
Critical viewers, however, also find the disturbing counterpoles: For example, the Group’s management has rejected a protest by employees completely after the fees of the company’s kindergarten were doubled, and the management said that the employee’s several meals were too expensive. However, this all was quite mild in contrast to the fact that Google went to the knees in 2006, even before the Chinese government, and agreed to an agreement that all the regime-critical hits, or those that violate the good taste, would be filtered out.
The Group's internal rules are that no new services will be applied in advance, but only if they are already available. However, the events of the coming months and years could be strongly reversed: While some think that Google's book and magazine scan project or archiving project is now taking on a scale that would soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, others are concerned about the "Health" system, which allows the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database already gives the next generation of Sci-Fi authors the fabric - for example "Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes in best orwell manner a future in which a person, thanks to Google, becomes horrificly approachable.
Two young people help the double murderer of Ózd to eliminate traces
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, the police have now interrogated two young people who are suspected of having helped eliminate the traces, the spokesman of the Borsod police commissioner announced on Tuesday.
The young people were fit and are currently being charged with the aid.
According to information from the news agency MTI, they are two girls who defend themselves freely.
Aid is threatened with a prison sentence of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was arrested on Sunday.
The man is accused of deliberately murdering several people out of greed for money.
In the course of the investigations, it became clear that the 23-year-old owed a larger amount of money to a 53-year-old.
The suspect, however, did not want to settle his debts, so he lured his creditor on a site in Ozd last Wednesday, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to MTI, the man has planned the act of a long hand - this also proves the fact that he committed the murder with a gun hidden at the crime scene.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange Offers Purchases for Prague Stock Exchange
Around 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, have offered the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the 100% purchase of the shares packages of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, reaffirmed the offer made by Poland despite the fact that they were formerly excluded from the Czechs as possible owner of their stock exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange belongs entirely to the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, but it wants to sell more than 60% of the papers in the coming months.
Following reports of the Czech daily "E15", the offers of Poland include the highest purchase price so far offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
As the newspaper reports, so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Transatlantic, New York Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have offered.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange was probably the worst new owner of all the interested parties, and he did not rule out that this could even lead to the closing of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders' agreements, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent stake, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their comments on the ever-increasing international financial crisis, on Tuesday, a number of leading European papers already spoke of the "second September 11".
We owe the global financial disaster to the American president, said "La Repubblica" - the president was not even able to put his own party behind him for the draft law, which should bring some relief to the frightening situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as the billionaire investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a "second September 11th".
Parts of the press in Madrid also located the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership is responsible for the world economy now on the verge of collapse.
The American financial system threatens to collapse more and more, and the whole world will suffer as a result.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now, after the Congress vote, threatens that Washington has no political means of crisis management.
The world economy hangs in the air, just at a time when one of the greatest transformations of the history of capitalism is taking place.
One can no longer ignore the threat, for example, the Geneva "Days Advertiser".
While some states may still be able to provide their money institutions with rescue packages and save banks with taxpayers' money from bankruptcy.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and there are no more banks going, then no further financial injections or other immediate measures will help.
In the long term, EU Member States would have to jump over their shadows and centralise control of money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion were paid out of weakening financial institutions, the Wiener "Der Standard" recalls. Furthermore, according to the newspaper, the concerns are becoming increasingly realistic that, according to the Americans, European taxpayers would now have to intervene a little deeper in their pockets in order to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not seriously addressed the crisis, which is now sweeping like a tsunami over the old continents.
Although the "radars" would not have to "turn" immediately with several hundred billion euros, it would be advisable to state in which case it would be reasonable to charge taxpayers' money in order to avoid even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the bumblebee
What would be the best method for developing new technologies to avoid accidents if they did not imitate the obstacle sensors from nature?
For example, those of bees.
At CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was presented which inspired the Nissan engineers of Hummeln in creating new systems of accident prevention.
In cooperation with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C biomimetic system controlled by Autobots, a mini-car, equipped with the properties of bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In flight, each bee forms its own, oval "private" area, which is very similar to our own "protective shield", said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, at the exhibition.
The compound eye of the bee, which can see in any direction and at an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role.
To imitate the function of the composite eye, the researchers picked up the idea of the laser-controlled distanceometer.
This identifies obstacles before the BR23C in a 180 degree field of vision within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately initiates the collision avoidance process.
The obstacle is registered in fractions of seconds, and the Autobot immediately changes the price, similar to the movement of bees, by turning the tires around the corresponding angle.
In contrast to previous systems, this maneuver takes place purely instinctively.
"If not, the author could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, Head of the Mobility Laboratory and the Autobot Project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer in which accidents are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect the behavior of bees when they avoid other bees.
And that has to be done in the fraction of a second.
However, in contrast to the bees, the deviation cannot be made down, or even diagonally - it can only be two dimensional, i.e. only in the direction of the rotation of the tires.
While the bees are endlessly open here to avoid other bees, the researchers were able to use the Autobot only the rotational movement, or acceleration and braking.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy efficient and therefore have a longer life span than conventional lithium-ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it comes to the instinctive, intelligent response, and less to the processing of the data, and even less to the ability to store it.
This device only needs to process a few inputs per second and react accordingly to them.
It does not have to store them, or produce an intuitive, logical response using previous maneuvers, so that it is currently only a handful of KB memory.
There is no need for gigabytes and megabytes of heavy memory.
This is the first step in the development of immediate collision avoidance technology, which according to Nissan's assessment will be in production as a whole within the next ten years.
Another application could find the technology in GPS satellite navigation by deliberately steering the car driver around obstacles and thus leading him to the goal.
A name for the disabled child
Now, the written version of the 700-billion-dollar rescue package law, which will be applied in several stages, is aimed at buying bad banks' loans.
In the first pass, half of the money is to be spent.
In a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight Local Time East Coast, Congressmen, after several days of debates, agreed on the 700-billion-dollar rescue package, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the American House of Representatives, and said that the agreement should only be put to paper.
The compromise reached on the rescue package supported both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
Minister of Finance Henry Paulson said the result: the program will have an impact and it will be efficient, but it will have to do even more. According to Pelosi, this was not about saving Wall Street, but about tearing away the business rudder.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e., Washington's time Sunday evening 8:00 (Central European time Monday 2:00 a.m.), but did not trigger a high-speed flight on the stock exchanges.
On Monday the House of Representatives will vote first on the 2008 Bill to stabilise the economy, then the Senate will be next in line.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday evening, and also the White House welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress made at night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our markets and to protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, spokesperson of the White House.
The program, however, deviates from the original recommendation of the Bush Administration, according to which the $700 billion should be issued at once for the purchase of rotten securities with loans of burdened securities.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the 700-billion-dollar sum will be spent, 250 billion will be available immediately after the Congress will vote on the Causa as expected on Monday. This sum will be spent on the purchase of credit-storage, bad securities, and the further USD 100 billion will be decided by the President.
The programme will be reviewed by a separate Commission, which will also be part of the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on another congress decision.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance can also apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously purchase bad loans, mortgages, and securities charged with mortgages, or other "toxic" loans.
As reported by the competent persons of the Ministry, the purchase can take place both in an auction and directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the concerns and pays the companies the expected damages.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary means so that up to $700 billion can be made available as emergency aid for the American financial system, whether it is for the large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of a systemic risk caused by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We are taking the necessary steps so that we are ready to introduce the law as soon as it has been signed, says Paulson.
However, the managers of the banks in difficulty and now dependent on state aid can expect their disposals, called "Golden Handshake" in the overseas snake salopp, to be shortened by the government.
There will be a reduction in salaries only in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps each.
The reduction essentially means that when the ministry buys at an auction, the "Golden Handshake" is taxed, unless the bank manager served is transferred to the pension.
In the event of a direct purchase of the foul loans, the government will aggressively engage to ensure that the management salaries are not exaggerated.
The picture also includes that the existing Golden Handshake contracts will not be amended - the restrictions only relate to new agreements, so that more people participate in the program.
This is the first case in American history that cuts in management salaries are regulated by law, commented Democracy Barney Frank, Chairman of the Financial Committee, the measure.
The State gains participation rights in participating banks so that the risk to taxpayers decreases as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus also the rescued bank goes back.
The draft law foresees that the President will have to make a proposal to the Congress over the next five years, as taxpayers will have to recover their lost money from the financial sector.
However, there were sceptics on both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
This is not what the American citizens expect from us, the plan does not protect taxpayers' money, says Californian Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said: The measures were advanced by the same people who are also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to increase
Like the Central Statistical Office, domestic sales prices rose by 0.1 per cent in August 2008 compared with the previous month, compared with August 2007, by 12.9 per cent.
Export prices were 1.1 per cent higher than those in July 2008 and decreased by 3.9 per cent compared to previous year's prices.
As a result of the price changes in the domestic and export sectors, production prices were 0.7% higher than in the previous month and 3.2% higher than in 2007.
Domestic sales prices have only slightly increased by 0.1 per cent compared to the previous month.
Sales prices of the manufacturing industry have also risen little - 0.1 per cent - since July.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was for leather goods (2.8 per cent) - mainly for bags and belts - an increase of 4.6 per cent, while for shoes, prices rose by 2.5 per cent.
Higher prices of plastics and chemical raw materials significantly increased prices of chemicals and production (1.6 percent).
Price reductions were recorded in crude oil processing (1.4 percent), electrical and technical equipment (0.9 percent) and small in wood processing (0.1 percent).
Prices in papermaking, publishing and printing remained unchanged.
In other branches of the manufacturing industry, a price increase was measured between 0.2 and 0.9 percent.
In industry's major domestic markets, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices rose by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly as a result of the price increase in gas introduced on 1 July.
Looking at the domestic sales markets of the manufacturing industry over the year, prices in crude oil processing have risen most (32.4 per cent).
In the metalworking sector, a 13.2-percent increase was observed, while the increase in the production of food, beverages, and tobacco was 11 percent.
Price reductions were observed in the textile industry (2.5 percent) and electrical and technical equipment (0.3 percent).
The level of cost in the other manufacturing industries was between 0.6 and 9.1 per cent.
In total, prices in manufacturing industry climbed by 10.2 percent last year.
Electricity, gas, steam and water prices rose by 18.7 percent compared to the previous year.
On the domestic sales market, the highest price increase was recorded in August (0.7 percent) in the investment goods sector.
In the consumer goods production sectors, prices rose by 0.3 per cent, while in the energy and further processing sectors they remained the same compared to the previous month.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was observed in the energy and re-use sector (16.8 percent compared to the 2007 comparative period).
In sectors producing consumer goods, a price increase of 6.8 per cent has been recorded, a price reduction of 1.4 per cent for fixed assets.
The export prices of the industry measured in Forint rose by 1.1 per cent in August from the previous month, but in comparison, there was a decrease of 3.9 per cent in the year.
The domestic currency became 1.7 percent weaker compared to the euro, the dollar was 7.1 percent weaker, and compared to the price of August 2007, it became 7.5 percent stronger compared to the euro, even at the dollar by 15.9 percent stronger.
No more visas in the United States from 2009 onwards?
Kinga Göncz sees good opportunities for the US-Hungarian visa agreement to enter into force on 12 January, as the Foreign Minister declared before the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In her view, "it is only now that everything depends on the timely introduction of the electronic immigration or control system in overseas."
However, she also stressed that there would be no entry permit in the new system, but the tourists would have to register in advance.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy is currently conducting negotiations in Washington.
She meets Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will hand over the "Middle Cross of Merit with Star" to the Republic of Hungary, and she also talks with foreign political advisers of Democratic Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support rescue packages for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, pledged their support on Sunday for the 700 billion dollar rescue package for banks, but there are also politicians who demand the resignation of the finance minister.
The Congress and government representatives announced on Sunday that they had reached an agreement on the banking bailout package after days of marathon consultations.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the collapse of the frozen credit market, have become the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better than the opponent in question to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
After recent surveys Obama was able to further expand its lead thanks to the economic issues, while McCain's Hoch, who gave him the presentation of Vice-President Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, melted away at the same time.
At an election campaign in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the Congress will quickly adopt the law on the 700 billion dollar package.
He stressed that the plan also included those passages of consumer protection with which he supported.
"We must now act responsibly (...) - your jobs, your savings, the entire industry, and the stability of the entire economy are threatened" - he told 35,000 spectators.
He has not failed to call McCain's economic visions "obsolet".
In an interview given to Sender ABC, McCain explained: "We will all have difficulty in (...) but nothing is certainly no alternative".
The Republican Senator said that the plan also prescribes the establishment of a Control Commission for the Minister of Finance, as well as the restriction of the executions for top managers - something that he has insisted on.
The CBS told Obama that McCain had not played a definite role in the negotiations, whereas he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, the speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, announced that the House of Representatives will probably vote on the draft law as early as Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking area
The right camp is intact, only the voters were more confident within the camp - so commented "Der Spiegel" the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror (spegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-hand German news magazine, Franz Walter analyses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bayern's Revolution annihilates her fathers".
According to the renowned politician, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over his offices.
The Christian-Socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
The breaking of the epoch is at the same time a problem of Christian democracy, as well as of Angela Merkel.
Surprisingly, the CSU's disaster did not come to an end, but on Sunday something came to an end, which, however, was already quite exactly ten years ago: the indisputable hegemony of a state party
Ten years ago, 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent and has been falling below the fifty percent mark for the first time since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, which is still in the much quoted Stoiber era.
Last but not least, the modernisation carried out by the CSU in the federal state has destroyed its own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had already predicted this 40 years ago, but at the same time it was very slow. However, without any impact, the secularization, the educational success, the influx of East and North Germans into the prosperous regions of Bavaria could not remain true of the CSU electors.
Modernization always goes hand in hand with option multiplication, and that has political consequences.
The right camp is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and more willing.
It is striking that in the last few weeks, the classic groups of citizens have expressed the greatest distance from the CSU: the free professions, the commercial citizenship and voters with a degree such as university degrees.
Here the support of the CSU dropped to less than 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Wiener Tagezeitung reports in her "Who with whom? Party leaders withholding in coalition questions" article about the chaotic domestic political situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the integration of the SPÖ into internal affairs.
The BZÖ shows itself open to discussions in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to determine themselves in relation to a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debates on public-law television, the party leaders hardly had their cards looked at.
SPÖ-Chief Werner Faymann reaffirmed his desire to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between both parties is very possible - in some Länder and in the social partnership this is already the case.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current Head of the ÖVP as Vice Chancellor, was left to Faymann.
As he said, the voters would have chosen the Schüssel-Meller course.
A repetition of this direction would not be in question.
Molterer reacted carefully to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said if Faymann tried to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
Whether his party is in opposition or in coalition is currently fully open, and these issues should be discussed within ÖVP.
BZÖ-Chief Jörg Haider showed himself open in all directions.
"To prevent red-black, we are ready to assume government responsibility," says Haider.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities, which will be hosted by the EU Presidency country of France this year.
In her speech addressed to the plenary, Lívia Járóka, Member of the European People's Party of Fidesz, paid particular attention to education segregation, since it is one of the most serious violations that Roma children encounter, and that is the biggest obstacle to their need for application.
The high-level conference was opened by French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs Xavier Bertrand on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European legal protection and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
As reported by the press office of MEPs at Fidesz, Járóka pointed out that, in addition to discrimination in job search, Roma would be displaced from the labour market due to their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma youth have no secondary education, and thanks to poor primary education, only a small part of them can reach a university degree".
Járóka also stressed that education was a fundamental human right, a key factor in the application of other human rights.
Investments in early training of Roma children could strengthen the economy of EU Member States.
In the view of the honourable Members, it is important that these relations become aware of the broadest possible circle - Roma and non-Roma.
The earlier a Roma student starts school, the more his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market are increased; and through income and turnover taxes they contribute to national spending.
"As citizens of the Union, the Roma must be guaranteed the right to high-quality education - the poor and segregated teaching must be discontinued" - says Lívia Járóka.
As the honourable Members have said, a joint, goal- and action-oriented approach by the European Union is necessary to accelerate the process of desegregation in the education sector and to ensure that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives are properly complied with.
"We need to break through the vicious circle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment and give Roma children democratic opportunities to contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens," Járóka demanded.
Since the Berlin Congress last year, the summit has been organised annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the achievement of the objectives of equality of opportunity and freedom of discrimination at European and national level, in line with the "European Year of Equal Opportunities".
CSU: Grace on Time
At the end of October the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided
Despite the electoral debacle, no heads are rolling, at the top of the Bavarian CSU staff debates have been postponed.
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the question is just how long this grace will last.
The fate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17 percent loss of vote will be decided on the last October weekend at the extraordinary day of the party.
The much educated duo, however, had already seen that it does not want to stick on her armchairs.
In this way, they want to reduce the annoyed group and the party base, which demanded a day after the Bavarian tsunami, in view of the loss of the absolute majority of personal consequences.
Five years ago - admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at his top career - the Christian-Social Union reached 60.7 percent. Now, however, one year after the coup against Stoiber, they were able to secure only 43.4 percent of the votes.
For 46 years, the CSU was a sole regulator in Bavaria, which generates 18 percent of German GDP.
Although conservatives remain the decisive force in the southern country, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, they will have to rule in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of intra-party restructuring, the potential successor of Hubers, Vice President and Federal Minister for Agriculture Horst Seehofer will also be involved in the investigation team, which will conduct exploratory talks on a possible Munich coalition with the liberal FDP, or the "free voters" in court.
A irony of fate is similar to the list of "free voters" that Gabriele Pauli enters the legislature, whose anti-substantial appearances the Huber-Beckstein duo first used to serve the determined politician mercilessly.
The CSU leadership is now concentrating all its forces on the stabilisation of Beckstein.
In this transition process, Stoiber, who has so far drawn the threads from the background, has an active role to play. The former Prime Minister and CSU President called September 28 the "bittest day of his political career".
On Monday, Huber made a few toxic remarks towards CDU - his view that the CSU would have earned far more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a signal to the CDU and hence also to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which has contributed much to success at national level in 2005, is not put back on its feet with a joint power act, Merkel cannot become a chancellor again after the Bundestag elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who was disappointed by the Fiasko, believes that the CSU's loss of land will not have a negative impact on the great coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of the social democrats will continue.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD has achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukaschenko Opposition: 110-0
In the Sunday elections, no member of the opposition was able to stand in the Ukrainian parliament.
Russian observers believe that this is in the prosperity and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects that there are illegalities in the counting of votes.
The OECD, which has sent out 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognised the elections.
De Legislatur of the 10 million inhabitants has been without opposition for decades. Nevertheless, the opposition gathered under the name "United Democratic Forces" (ODS) before yesterday's elections has seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who had already renewed his Presidency mandate for the fourth time in 2006 with a constitutional amendment, would "let" some members of the opposition in Parliament this time.
That is why the ODS has even taken a distance from the previously planned boycotts.
Ukraine is becoming increasingly dependent on the economy thanks to the rising prices of natural gas imports from Russia. Even loans were accepted for the reduction of price increases, and the country has also agreed to divest the Beltransgas, the owner of the country-leading gas pipeline, to the Russians. In the light of the opposition's expectations, the hope was that Ukraine would improve its relationship with the EU after Lukashenko and other senior politicians had banned entry into the EU due to the political system that was considered to be anti-democratic.
The OECD's evaluation report, in which the emphasis was rather on positive movements, instead of on the shortcomings, such as the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidates from the elections, provided temporary relaxation.
However, the OECD's rapid report already on Monday criticised the campaign - which is why oppositionals do not appear in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present in the counting of votes.
Despite all this, the opposition is able to recognise an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been set free, for example, and Minsk is even prepared for smaller confrontations with Moscow by continuing to deny the independence of the apostate Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine on paper forms a federal state, has been considered independent for one month.
"We have taken two steps forward and backward, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," said Alexander Milinkevich to our paper.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential elections, a continuation is desirable, although "the powerful have been afraid to leave only one oppositionant in Parliament".
The opposition is not planning protests in the light of the results, but rather tries to clarify the need for economic reform to voters.
"We have many problems to deal with here - the opposition newspapers have to be printed in Russia, the local authorities put us in the way of selling stones, but yet I see that more and more people are supporting change, even the older ones" - Milinkevich pointed out that not even the most supported layer of pensioners is agreed with the Lukashenko regime, the only merit of which is the production of social security.
"Thanks to the country's indebtedness and the rise in trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the "social security" which urges the silence of a cemetery begins to crumble," Milinkevich said.
Unlike opposition politicians, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergej Lebedev, Head of the Mission of the Community of Independent States, explained to the news agency Ria Novosti: "People believe the deeds, and not the words." Therefore, the lack of opposition is a proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast is served before work"
For the first time in the history of Palazzo Chigi there are rotating doors for the entrances and exits of the officials.
As of today, the measure will come into force against those slubbers who first stamp off and then go drinking coffee during the working hours.
The new Anti-Faulpelz Act was presented today by Renato Brunetta, the Minister of Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers.
">"Driving doors were a means of increasing labour efficiency through a higher rate of presence and more services," said Minister Brunetta.
"Now a new era of responsibility and transparency begins.
This is reformism," says Brunetta once again.
With the Palazzo Chigi the installation ends in all the buildings of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: "The choice of the rotating doors is also of great symbolic value".
On the part of the officials there was no resistance, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all those who cooperated on all sides".
All in all, there is now no breakfast during the working hours; end with coffee or croissant.
Brunettas advises on this with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 a.m. works wonders".
During a meeting of the General Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Publica Amministazione)
in Rome, the minister announces that "within three months, officials' absences have been reduced to 50%, i.e. 60,000 people per year are more present at work".
He added that it was necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the Italian public administration
"their pay dynamics - according to the Minister - have been twice as large over the past 8-10 years as the private sector and far above the inflation rate".
In the meantime, thousands of officials have joined forces to counter the Brunetta Decree in the context of the appeal supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister for Public Service profiled himself with figures on lower reductions in work - according to the Consumer Centre - the people of the "real fools" are growing continuously.
In fact, thousands of right and valuable officials of the public service have gathered together to explain the war to the unjust standards of the decree."
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related illness; the planned extension of the mandatory house arrest of the sick worker, during which control visits can be made and further aspects of the Minister's renewal are being challenged.
Napolitano: "Preventing accidents at work is crucial"
Every day in Italy 2500 accidents at work, three people die and 27 remain disabled for life.
For 2007, the data from Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal accidents at work were approximately 1200.
These figures prove the seriousness of a phenomenon which causes almost twice as many deaths as murder.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalididi del Lavoro) in all the provinces of Italy will commit the 58th National Day for the Victims of Accidents to draw the attention of the social institutions and the media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data disseminated by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," affirms the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in his communication to the President of Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to the prevention of jobs, the protection of injured workers, the support of the families of the victims and the awareness of the public opinion".
"An insolent "basta" has stood up to this; understandablely, in the case of tragedies, which, measured by their scale, trigger some whirlwinds in the media and public intervention. However, everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even be repeated in their own dynamics".
Napolitano does not hide that "there is in any case a resource problem: there must be a decisive investment in education and information."
A special importance is attached to the numerous initiatives to become more directly aware of the school frameworks of young people who feed on the labour market.
It is our duty to focus attention on this phenomenon and not to divert it from its social seriousness. A legislative standard must be put into force and improved.
On the other hand, the President of the Chamber of Gianfranco Fini stressed "like the phenomenon of work-related deaths constitutes an urgent social emergency, which offends the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work towards decisive rules that aim to put an end to the problem".
"The data of the accidents at work seem to signal a slight improvement, but this does not rule out that the number of accidents at work is much too high," stresses President of Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this "positive tendency" to mean less attention. That's exactly what causes tragedy at the end."
"How do you think that you are essentially doing too little to counter the phenomenon of accidents? You can fight against it through various actions.
We believe that stronger controls and inspections are necessary – according to Mercandelli, but also stronger measures to inform workers who are already starting school".
"An additional effort is needed - so he adds - in terms of communication and awareness-raising of the public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers is called for in relation to a phenomenon that is a social emergency".
Mercandelli also pointed out "the progressive deterioration of protection for the victims of accidents at work" and addressed the "disposal of the social system against which we have been fighting in recent years".
"The aim, therefore, is to return a guarantee to the worker on insurance so that the fate of the victim of an accident at work does not depend on voluntary or accidental donations, which are decided by a legislator at the moment".
Mp3 Player Under Charge: Danger of Hearing Damage
Sound music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as Mp3 players, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is what the European Commission reports, which cites the opinion of the Csrseri (Scientific Committee on Current and Recently Identified Health Risks) of the EU in a report published today in Brussels.
"From the report – as stated in a note – it becomes clear that 5-10% of those who hear loud music with portable music for at least five years per week, with a permanent loss of their hearing, are at risk of hearing for at least one hour a day".
"I'm worried that such a large number of young people, who usually use portable music devices and cell phones, put on a high volume to damage their hearing without knowing it irrevocably," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From the scientific findings – that is, from the European Union – there is a clear risk that is pressing for rapid action.
What really counts is to raise awareness of consumers and turn this information into a common resource.
In the light of these scientific findings, we need to re-examine the existing control systems so that they are fully effective and keep up with the new technology".
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable musical instruments among young people.
"The scientists - thus concluding the EU communication - confirm that we are quite concerned and that the European Commission, together with the other members of the European Union and those concerned, will now examine the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise coming from portable music devices and similar devices."
There is already a European standard, which limits the level of noise from portable music devices to 100 dB, and concerns about the damage that could result from excessive noise pollution.
It is possible to limit these damage to solutions such as the reduction of volume and the length of noise exposure.
In her report, the Scientific Committee of the European Union points out that if users of portable music devices are only five hours a week (more than 89 decibels) music, so that the legal limits are already exceeded, the maximum noise level at the workplace applies.
Those who cross this border risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
This represents 5-10% of users of such devices, whose number can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno gives the launch of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We're starting today, it's supposed to be over in March, in June, balance is drawn.
This is the process laid down by the Capitol for the work of the Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome. This morning, the Commission met in the new seat behind the Caracalla-therms.
In six months the President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draw up the guidelines for Rome.
As soon as the project is completed, the City Council and the City Council will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present in June the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and Gianni Alemanno Mayor.
"The Commission is absolutely independent, and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," emphasizes Alemanno. "It will make proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political leaders remain the City Council and the City Council.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where one can develop a large project for Rome.
In March, their task will be completed and the Commission will be reconstructed, as such a project must have a certain end point in time.
In June - as the mayor announces - we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work done by the Commission."
Anyone who doubts the Commission's competence, as it lacks a commitment, which Alemanno says: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, as in France, the Attali Commission delivers quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics deals with everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to have a longer period of time in mind to work seriously in a deeper perspective on the development of Rome and the future of the city".
The Mayor of Rome places great emphasis on clarifying the following: "This Commission is neither a useless institution, nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a cent and it will bring us to reflect. It will employ the best minds of the capital".
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static in order to enable our city to jump in quality - which it really needs - and thus to take a joint step into the future".
A future, according to the Mayor of Rome, which "will not only be confined to the current local borders, but will look much further," not only with regard to the role of Rome as the metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here is a statement
A well-known American politician, much to be regarded as independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who decimated by his decisions, the economy of the United States, and who maintained (and still does so as a private man) with the enemy Islam.
The attacks against Obama are becoming increasingly violent, right now, where the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote in an Internet page: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very naughty: he thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation who has seen two black governors and five black senators in total!".
However, these attacks do not have much to say; they are racist attacks and they do not answer the electorate's question: will he be a good president? And then there are also the polls; everyone says that Obama will win with a great advantage.
Even in this case, there are people who talk to the heart and not to the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, has written in her editorial: only in the polling booth will we know who the real American Patriot will give his voice.
Here comes a mentality of the United States that has been kept up to last hidden.
"Tell us what you want, then we will decide for whom we will make our Kreuchen, whether for Obama or for McCain."
There are people there who swear: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you never heard before – only now that the success of the black candidate seems so secure.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: What mistakes did Bush make during his term of office? 89% replied: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent back home with one step in the butt.
In Iraq 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for the majority of Bush's weak point.
The one who will take his place is faced with a huge task.
The financial collapse also leaves its mark on journalists: in the newspapers one can already feel the cuts. And many accuse the Internet, the "killer" of the printing press.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control regarding the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nevertheless, they did not really express concern about the general credibility of the information concerning the authorities.
They don't feel as alone as they used to.
The problem for American journalists is money.
The 2008 crisis is an economic model that has been destroyed for these journalists.
In addition, the major problems are caused by the cuts in the newsroom, i.e. the space in which the editors work to compile the paper.
This is a problem that must be solved – as the interviewed journalists do – if you want to prevent the traditional journalism, as the big audience understands it, from shrinking significantly.
A clear but complicated pessimism today fills the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executive seniors of the printing press believe that journalism is on the wrong track at national level.
In the local area, the executives are even 65%.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine the direction in which the web is going.
The most important publishing groups are paving the way into the Internet, which is considered by many to be the "killer" of the printing press.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists has risen by up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted to wanting to join the new technology, hoping "to bring something good for journalism".
The biggest crack in American journalism is now between the editors-in-chief of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of chief editors at national level are confident that their reporters share their values with them, while at local level it is only 23%.
Some think it has to do with "security in work".
The managers who are afraid to lose their jobs within three years are 47% at national level.
The number of journalists is 30%.
The theme of "safe work" in the team (our "editors", Note: Red.) is always an up-to-date topic in the US.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation, like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV channels and Internet operators, employers offer them how they like it and so it will be a question of take it or leave it.
The editor-in-chief often gets very high wages, but the editor can sometimes get only 10,000 euros per month, along with pension and insurance money.
As for the holiday, the thing is complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, such and so many after the third, to finally reach 15 holidays after a certain number of years.
But the American journalists will, as they themselves admit, often "sick" during the year.
It is a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: JUDGMENT IN ROM: DANILO COPPOLA BETWEEN GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the Second Chamber of Criminal Court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudio, has decided to reject the property broker's request, which had asked to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is determined against Coppola for bankruptcy in the context of the anti-corruption investigation in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
In the course of the trial against him during the last week, his release from the house arrest was turned into a residence duty in Grottaferrata.
His attorneys Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate agent to be transferred from the provincial town to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such relocations (against which the prosecution had expressed itself) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and reach him indicting evidence.
The Elite is in danger
The phenomenon had already been revealed a few days ago when the Chamber of Deputies voted against the 700 billion dollar saving package of the White House: a large part of the Americans was and is more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
This confirms yesterday's edition of the New York Times, which tells of how the crisis progressed the Republican party, which is becoming increasingly divided into its old and moderate East Coast Seele, which always favoured the state institutions and the business community and those neoconservatives who are hostile to "those in Washington" and the financial world and, above all, in the south and the center of the states voters.
This part of the party owes its rise to the voice of what I mentioned above.
However, this example just mentioned is only a small part of the major changes that announce the current economic earthquake or even already represent: not only in the United States, but also throughout the West and perhaps beyond these will be affected by it.
Both in the States and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long-afraid events that finally take shape and come to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the new discovery, the unheard renaissance of the state in connection with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline in the banking and financial institutions, which have close links with abroad and at the same time manage an enormous amount of private households' assets living in a single state.
This is an immediate political problem for governments: how to deal with the families affected, which is a huge electorate.
The economic crisis is therefore global and politically opposed to it, it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have fallen short of itself and lost its right to speak: the clear proof of this has been given by the EU, which, because of its division into various national and international conflicts, does not know how to find a common way.
For this reason, everyone is counting on the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and, above all, the distribution of aid funds: since the crisis has become more and more serious, only the US in the economic situation can be saved without foreign aid.
And besides the funds, they also have the legitimacy to use them: thus two unsurpassed conditions – under certain circumstances – that otherwise will not be able to rely on international organisation and no market in a similar way.
The new emphasis placed on the state-national element is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance which is most recently linked in the economy to a most closely related sector: territoriality.
Paradoxically, it is precisely now that we were so convinced that we have long since entered a connected empire, into a realm of ever-differentiated technologies, intangibles, that we need to determine at once how our future will increasingly depend on essential material things: water, harvesting and oil.
While these can certainly all be transported from one place to another in the world, they are nevertheless extremely connected to a closely defined piece of earth – a territory.
Therefore, the one who has such a territory is in favour of another who lives in a cropless, waterless or oil-free area.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, presupposes a brief introduction.
Those who say territory, who government, who politics, say so too Leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis appears to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, there is knowledge about the need for respected leadership, so the need for someone who knows how to regulate things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of disenchantment over the existing leadership, including that of the economy, which has emerged as insufficient and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a profoundly rich and worrying aspect: a loss of trust, an impatience, an image of inadequacy, a feeling of distance, all aimed at a whole class of managers of the Western countries.
This seems to pave the way for conviction among large parts of the population that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their Way of Life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content is the majority as an ever more alien and superior.
The demand for leadership thus subterraneanly nourishes a defying but powerful movement of the demise of the leading class and of the conventional political establishment. This manifests itself in unforeseen "revolts" of voters and in the immediate upheaval of the collective state of mind of recent times: starting with the rise of the Conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, over the collapse of the Labour Party in Great Britain, towards the rebellion of the American MPs against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy also plays a role here).
One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, as well as their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, more and more problems of understanding and therefore less representative value of what is going on in the lower social strata of the West today, and is being driven even more and more by the financial crisis to over-dimensionality.
In view of all this, it would be simply exaggerated to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
But keeping your eyes wide open is certainly not.
The superglue that goes up on walls
To defeat the forces of gravity thanks to a adhesive and to be able to climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which seems to have reached almost the target.
With a glue applied on an area of only 2.5 sqcm, the researchers succeeded in fixing a 100 kg body on a vertical wall.
STUDIO – an American magazine, has published the results of the researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of a stack of spaghetti arranged pipes," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of Geckos, which are covered by microscopic herds that give the animal a perfect hold.
The tests carried out with various materials such as glass Teflon and sand paper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the durability of the feet of the reptiles and at the same time "makes it easy to remove from the wall," said Liming Dai, researcher of the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
"This material could be used as a perishable adhesive," Liming Dai adds.
Like Spiderman, to get up on walls? Perhaps already, but the researchers think of less fascinating benefits, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also conductors of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application may fall within the space sector.
So for the moment, the superheroes still have to wait.
The other kind of research – also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new type of adhesive.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, the California scientists present a adhesive made of microfibres that, like hair, cleanses itself from dust by moving on a surface and thus always retains perfect liability.
Medicines: never take fruit juice
Be careful with grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed in summer due to their refreshing quality and richness of vitamins, can cause serious health damage when taken at the same time as certain vital medicines, as they can have an extreme effect on the absorption of these drinks by the body.
David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points to the risk of packaged fruit juices as well as fresh fruit juices in connection with drug consumption. At the 236th American Chemical Society Meeting in Philadelphia, he again called for an alarm: a glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice suffices to reduce the absorption of certain essential medicines to the point of practically eliminating them and thus endangering the health of the patients.
Grapefruit juice was already under suspicion of being responsible for increasing the effects of some medicines such as antibiotics, antiasthmatics, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolytics and neurologicals, up to toxic levels.
MEDICAN MEASUREMENT – The same Agency of the drug had warned doctors and patients in a report two years ago about the risks of this mixture, and stressed that what is being drunk in conjunction with drugs such as diazepan or methadone.
ES IS NOT GREEP FRUIT – According to the experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the medicines.
The list of active substances that are inhibited by fruit juices is long.
Therefore, the appeal of Michele Carruba, Director of the Università Statale di Milano: "Such results are usually forwarded immediately to the various international manufacturers, who are thus free to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is recommended that you always read the package leaflet and, if there is any doubt as to whether you should ask for a pharmacist or a doctor", the expert of the Ansa Agency emphasises.
Nobel Economic Prize goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize is awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the settlement of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of Bush administration's economic and external policy.
A few months after the attacks of 11 September 2001, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman had claimed in an editorial of the New York Times that this second event was more decisive for the history of the United States than the attacks.
A prediction, which received little polemics as an answer and was held to the economist even years later, but today proves to be completely correct.
"I am surprised and also shocked at how quickly the memory of scandals in the context of Enron's or Worldcom's collapses has disappeared from public view," Krugman explained at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "economist of great value", but also a banalist with a "very aggressive style, especially against the extreme liberalism of the Bush administration."
Open Office, it appears the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package
The date of publication of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has arrived; the Open Source software wins an ever greater number of users, both at home and in the office, both among freelancers and in the public administration as free replacement for Microsoft's Office.
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers supervised by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is now presenting itself with some new features to the audience: besides a revised and now Spartan-designed start menu, one of the reasons for ensuring compatibility with Apple's Mac OS x operating system is finally reached, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.e. the latest standard ISO version.
In addition, the compatibility with Microsoft's Office 2007 was countered, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Also interesting are some new features, such as those that allow you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which makes sending via email easier. This also includes the possibility to import PDF files into graphic editing modules while keeping the original appearance of the page.
Thus, "hybrid" PDF files can now be generated, which expands the typical graphics of Adobe format around the elements of a table and a text processing system.
The cooperation is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be processed by several users, avoiding conflicts with changes; in the case of the text processing system, each processor is assigned a basket to ensure a better correction process.
Some companies are just about to publish various functions of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while the final result is to be published in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available on the following link for download: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0/download300.html. Thus, it follows the English version, which has been on the mirrors since Friday.
Except for Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, you can have the installation CD sent to your home or office.
However, if the freedom of choice is an incentive for the distribution of the programme in the private households, it is precisely in the business area where OpenOffice could succeed in the big throw: after all, various institutions of public administration and schools have already moved to OpenOffice.
In fact, it is not even lacking a training offer, which means optimal help for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even opening business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word Text Generation Program; Calc, the spreadsheet program, which aims to push Excel; Impress, to create presentations like PowerPoint; Dbase to operate databases instead of the more known access; and lastly Draw, a graphics module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads – a goal that can easily be exceeded at already reached 3 million and 600 thousand.
Also Kohl tested positively and thus the fourth doping case
A new doping case opens up in the past Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner, who is a third-classified winner and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
The news published the daily L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl from Team Gerolsteiner is the fourth driver, who has been tested positively on Cera, the third-generation EPO. Previously, this had already been achieved by the Italian Riccardo Ricco and Leonardo Piepoli as well as by the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from the blood samples of Kohl are among those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the countersamples confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place and will be excluded from the races for two years.
The head of the French Antidoping Commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive epicest, and, according to the Associated Press, also the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian climbed on the podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans and also claimed the jersey of the best climber for himself.
THEME CHANGES: THE NEW YORK TIMES ASKED: IS ITALIA RASSISTIC?
Italy, "the former country of migrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are only accepted with opposition.
Do this from Belpaese a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times asks in a long article dedicated to the whole subject of racism in Italy and the case of young Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered a month ago in Milan after stealing a pack of biscuits.
The case testifies to what the Times refer to as "Paradox of the North": the northern regions are those in which there is "most integration and work opportunities" and yet "the highest degree of anti-immigrationist sentiments and the greatest support of the Lega North".
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times call for further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation against immigration introduced by the Lega and for the swifter expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement that also underscores the Pope and the President-in-Office: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting on the Quirinal to cooperate between the Church and the State to combat racism."
Students victims of up to 900 Euros per room high rental prices
The market for apartments for students knows no crises.
According to the latest study of the Sunia, the tenants' union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken on very serious moves. All the crowds of students lose their right to study as, in fact, their families are unable to support them at this height" – says Sunia, Laura Mariani, "in these cities, the great demand from the students leads to a deformation of the market that has also damaged the other inhabitants.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of breaches: free contracts, missing registrations, no rental price limit, unauthorized sub-rents.
For the Sunia there is a need for exceptional measures, which result in lower rental prices due to a revision of taxation.
In more detail, it turns out that in Milan a sleeping place in the Brianza district is needed about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the Netherlands quarter) and ends with 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera district, or even 900 euros in the Vittoria quarter.
In Florence, a sleeping place costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room of 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate around the university in the quarters, 250/280 euros are for a sleeping place of need, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, prices in the neighborhoods around the university are around 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a sleeping place in a double room.
Only a little deeper are rents in the quarters around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those who choose outdoor areas can save money: 300 euros for a sleeping place and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a sleeping place, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive neighborhoods, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari a sleeping place costs 250-350 euros, a single room costs at least 350 euros.
Prices are lower in the smallest cities, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In the cities where the phenomenon of renting non-European students is more common, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a rent that is 25-30% higher than the average is required by foreign students.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso – the cities close their historic cinema halls
The historical cinemas close due to the favored multiplex cinemas.
"A city without cinema halls is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This image of the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is happening at the moment in the large urban centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-sail complexes in the periphery, means in the long term death for the single cinema in the centre. A process that not only seems inexorable and irrevocable, but also carries the trains of a cultural crime.
Affected are mostly historical places full of memories, "it is like losing a friend with whom a piece of street has been covered with emotion," said the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", who brought him the Oskar and the great prize of Cannes 20 years ago. It is the story of an urban cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a probably forever lost cinema world.
The figures provided by the Anec, the central trade association, speak a clear language: over the past five years, the enormous amount of 316 traditional cinemas have had to close; these pieces paid for most of the cinemas in the big cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions are Emilia Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This testifies to the fact that the main culprits are the multiplexkinos, because it is precisely these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas have been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years the Lombardy has introduced the lists, 81 are both in Tuscany and Emilia Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," said Paolo Protti, President of Anec, "it is useful that new structures also arise, but first of all, the preservation of the already existing, because closing a hall in the city, are not all his regular customers willing to visit instead of the old one multiplexkino in the periphery.
And here is the lack of a budget for the external trade union fund: the debt burden recorded by the state is about EUR 10 million.
It is a disgrace from the ethical and moral point of view that the government does not observe the existing laws.
In order to obtain the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros a year would be necessary".
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which, because of the fears about the old cinema halls, has decided to protect it by means of an agreement between the municipality and the Anec; it is the first such agreement in Italy, which aims to protect and support traditional cinemas, both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
The measures envisaged include tax advantages for cinema operators as well as benefits for the public in terms of local transport: it will be possible to travel to the traffic restricted areas of the centre and also to park at less favourable parking fees.
"It is a gratifying initiative," said Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will join our example and also design new concepts.
But certainly we also need better audio and video equipment to be able to set up something against the superpower of multiplex rooms, because finally the audience of today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closing of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point that led me to found the "NUovo cinema Paradiso", even though I had been playing with the thought for ten years.
For 25 years I have been living in Rome; when I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn aside to see the dusty posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the decisions of the community to the interests of the Mafia group Piromalli.
The charges of the attorneys of the Antimafia authorities of Calabria against the mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for involvement in Mafia business, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the older mediator between the Clan and the public administration, as well as his nephew, was also handcuffed: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the boss of the Clan, had already been sentenced to a sum of 10 million euros because of the involvement in criminal associations of the Mafia.
"Any kind of moral and legal standard disregarded," the lawyers wrote, "the two local authorities had decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli money for consulting activities."
"This made it possible for the Mafia Group – the judges – to enter the Council houses on an official basis and to participate in public administration policy."
The President of the Regional Committee of Calabria Agazio Loiero does not deny that in his region "there is nothing but an exception to encounter connections between local administrations and organised crime." "There are places where the concentration of the Mafia is greater than in others where such connections are practically unavoidable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of 'Ndrangheta: heroes who get a white vest."
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July, with which the police of Clan Piromalli was decapitated.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but already in 1991 – and also because of alleged connections between organized crime and local administration – local politicians had been removed from their municipal offices.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, has been elected head of the Central Judicial Coalition since May 2006.
He shouted scandal as the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He was interested in finding everything for political and strategic reasons in the Deputy Minister Marco Minniti, but the judges, in connection with the arrest order of this morning, explained that the Piromalli clan had even dared to request an amendment to the A3 project.
From a hearing action in connection with the investigations in the Dal Torrione case, the willingness has shown to respond to the wishes of an entrepreneur, who is known to be a representative of the large group around the piromalli – thus making the actions of the public administration identical with the interests of this clan."
When the energy comes out of the waves, suddenly the greats come up.
It is an unsealed source of money that covers over 70% of the surface of the planet and only now seems to understand the great energy companies of the world.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that are now looking at all, and are also looking to occupy, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and investigated for 70 years; these studies have not by chance intensified significantly since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil broke down around 1980, the idea of marine energy was forgotten, but now the environmental organizations and the increased oil price are pressing for new impetus in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the worldwide energy demand could be met by ocean waves.
This would equal the double of the current energy produced by nuclear power stations.
In addition, the currents and tides would be added.
Giants in the attack.
The first company that now relies on marine energy is Enersis, which signed a contract for the construction of a power plant in northern Portugal in 2005.
When this news was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies from the traditional energy industry are relying on marine energy production.
"Chevron investigates these technologies" – the speaker of a U.S. giant-known company in the Wall Street Journal – and weighs the opportunity to work with us."
It is about obtaining approval from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a project off the Alaska coast.
This is an inestimable sign, especially considering that oil is still being promoted by the US in Alaska and President Bush recently initiated the plans for new drilling.
Besides Chevron, the Verdant Power Inc. companies from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; the details are also unknown, so do observers speak of an increasing interest.
Irreformable technologies.
Experts speak of a technology that is still emerging, not least because the last doubts have not been clarified by the environmentalists.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are of rather small dimensions and do not seem to cause any serious ecological problems.
However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, technologies with a far greater impact on the environment are needed.
There are various possibilities: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of interconnected buoys.
The thrust of the waves, which move the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the swimmers via pistons and cylinders.
This drives a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The electricity is then sent via underwater pipelines to the coast.
So far, there are four planned installations of this kind, which are only waiting for state approval. Part of the energy gained could also be used for military facilities.
Verdant Power, however, already produces energy for a department store and a parking lot with the help of underground turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the tides stimulate the turbines, which feed the generator through the resulting rotational movement.
According to Verdant, a long queue of potential clients is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Electricity Generation Research, a special interest is immediately worthy of the potential that exists in the tides.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the tides are more predictable than wind currents, solar radiation and waves, and therefore a more reliable source of electricity.
It is precisely the tidal energy that led states such as New York, Maine and Alaska and other coastal states to invest already 7.5 million dollars in 2008 – up to 35 million are planned for 2009.
