What should she do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "Conditory".
The new councillors of the capital from the ranks of the ČSSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to be able to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city representation at all.
The Aktuálně.cz newspaper has a little "beat-off" from the ČSSD, members of the new council, as they have mastered the notorical snake, which has become a citizen in recent years, where today's coalition partners in Prague have been on the row.
The codified vocabulary introduced by Prague's political elite in the lost era of Mayor Pavel Bém is defrayed by some of the most famous actors, situations and causae.
Surprisingly it turned out that the new councils in relation to these new terms were falling slightly in the dark.
At least they claim that.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I don't know."
"I am rather a newcomer in Prague's policy," responded Lukáš Kaucký, the new Councillor for Culture, to the test of the "Paten-Wortschatzes".
But also the councillor Karel Březina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.
For example, on the term "Golfloch".
"This is the only expression of those you present to me that I use every now and then."
"Otherwise, I don't like snake."
From the vocabulary published by the Tageblatt Aktuálně.cz in this year of June in front of the ODS Election Congress, the editors picked out six terms, especially those associated with the Magistrate of Prague.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "largest Prague golf hole", "go to the pastry", "Stienracken", "treason of the capital" and "bleach".
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - promised first his participation in the conversation, but then did not even take the listener.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
"I don't care about these things and I don't judge how civil democrats talk to each other."
"For me, it's important how we understand ourselves in the framework of our programs," he said.
As already indicated, Lukáš Kaucký was allegedly unaware in the above headline that the influential entrepreneur and friend of the former mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek, is the speech.
The term "Voldemort" says Kaucky nothing at all and the only term he got right on the test was "the largest Prague golf hole".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," Kaucký says, adding to safety, "but I know more about that from the newspaper."
And funny: "I'm going to have to take a language course."
The "Golfloch" is then correctly delineated not only by Matador Karel Březina, but also by the councillor for environmental issues Lukáš Plachý as the tunnel Blanka.
Both social democrats also know who the term Voldemort stands for, and Lukáš Plachý even imagines where this figure is to be found and what it means to "go into the pastry".
"I think that means going into some Prague gastronomy business," Plachý is pretty close to the puzzle solution, if you know that it is the headquarters of Janoušek's companies.
In agreement with Březina, however, he claims to have drawn this knowledge from the newspaper rather than to have it his own vocabulary.
According to the test participants, there does not appear to be a similar civilised snake among the social democrats.
"I have also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is something like this in us."
"We call on the name, sometimes we also use shorts or nicknames," says the president of Prague's ČSSD Petr Hulinský - called "Hulda" by his comrades of the party.
"In school I was called Bříza (Birke), but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel Březina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz has tried the name and see where - it works.
Ratsherr Weinert is kind to the party comrades of the "opa" or less friendly of the "old", the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to himself before the elections by means of machinations at party sponsorship, is called "Igráček" (known Czech Lego figure).
Thus nicknames are the only one that allows the social democrats in the use of internal party language.
Hulinský does not seem to like it if he is called Hulda, but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname of the Prague Chairman.
His nickname "Doktor der Gummknüppel-Rechte" allegedly has to do with the fact that Petr Hulínský has acquired his title Doctor juris at the Bratislaver Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "witches" and published a brochure
Women who are stamped to witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social characteristics.
They belong to the older generation, they find no work - for example for health reasons, they are available and have no children.
If one of these women becomes witches, she is strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are very rarely affected by this fate."
"Even young and healthy women will be spared as they help with their work and give children" describes the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a special home of more than a hundred women who have been expelled from their communities.
The local government has now decided to oppose this abnormal "social measure".
And for this reason, published a brochure to stop the witch persecution.
But it's got a hook.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso can't read," said the newspaper "the standard" on the dilemma of written information.
The accusation of witchcraft, however, is also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighboring country of Burkina Faso, the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured by three women and two men to death - she poured them over with petrol and just lit them on.
Among other things, the server BBC reported on this incident.
The perpetrators, however, claimed that the matter was only a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances.
According to their version, oil was ignited to be used for ritualal anointings.
And after the group tried to "execute a bad spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of witches supports people here without regard for their education.
"The standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Fressers of human souls are a danger earlier than today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to defuse the witch hunt, last year the President of the Republic of Zambia himself has mixed quite well.
"President Yahya Jammeh, after his aunt's death, launched a monstrous witch hunt, as this allegedly contributed to their death and would now try to kill the president himself by black magic."
"He called out to help shamans from nearby Guinea, who, accompanied by policemen, soldiers and the President's bodyguard, were violently abducted women and men from gambican villages and brought them to the president's farm in Kanilai," said Amnesty International in her report.
On the farm, the ingrained people were forced to drink an abscess of plants with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested people did not survive the stay on the farm.
Only because of international pressure were nearly a thousand prisoners released again.
A tenant of Bakala: He heats in the oven - still pays higher rent
An elderly man is leaving the client center of the company RPG Byty of the "Coal Baron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a portfolio with three new leases to three apartments: for the own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who is just paying a prison sentence.
All three were increased in the context of the so-called "deregulation" of rents.
Instead of 3500 crowns, the son is scheduled to apply for a 2 bedroom apartment with kitchen of the second category 4100 crowns next year.
"And there is not even flowing warm water in the apartment and you have to heat in a simple coal furnace," he with his finger tipped at the new son's lease, for which he has a mandate.
"But what - I signed," he said half in agreement and half in signature.
The BytyOKD.cz Association, which called the new lease conditions "inappropriate and immoral", advises the tenants not to sign the new contracts and to wait until 7 December when they intend to publish an instruction on how to proceed against such contracts.
But the man's just waving off.
"One says this, the other does so," he makes a dark face.
The Ostrava region thus becomes a large "deregulation laboratory".
After New Year's Deregulation, most of the rental apartments in the Czech Republic are expected to pay their tenants no market rentals.
Aktuálně.cz decided to visit this "labor" personally.
The RPG storage room in Havířov is one of four in the Ostrava region and already nine o'clock in the morning on this Tuesday.
Right next door are the bodyguards of a security agency and a caller.
"Mite 2011", a special touchscreen button is illuminated.
Shortly tipped and already the device spits out a number label.
We barely signed the number "157" and already beeped on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later, you're in line.
A little later, an older couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the rush in the waiting room does not seem to apply to the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair applications, insurance matters and the like.
From mid-November in the region of Ostrava, the envelopes with the new leases flatten the most tenants of the 44,000 apartments of the portfolio of the RPG into the letterboxes.
The RPG Byty proposes a rental increase of about 15 to 38 percent in the letter.
The special switch for the new rentals at the client center has been opened since 18 November.
"The action is going on over a week, that is, it's only the beginning," the ladies behind the switch say after a moment when the "client" turns out to be a journalist.
The deregulation and Bakala's former mountain worker apartments are a brilliant theme.
Before the elections, the Vice-President of Parliament Lubomír Zaorálek from Ostrava had taken up this issue quite loudly, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of them.
"Twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"Not even nee. WC glasses could change them," the man mentioned in the introduction turns out to be air.
So far, according to the employees, pensioners are mainly on the switch to convince themselves that they will actually receive the promised rental discount that they promise RPG when they sign the special offer in time.
The other tenants who signed the new lease by 15 December will also benefit from a half-reduced February rent.
Until now, "deregulation switch" in Havířov is anything but overburdened by demand.
"From yesterday's 360 clients were only about 40 to 50 of the rentals in 2011 due here," the tradesmen estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on its websites, as well as wall panels where it appears necessary.
However, if the rental parties did not agree on the new rent, they would be determined by an independent court.
"This should not be a threat, but should be understood as information about the only possible and totally legitimate legal procedure," RPG explains on his websites.
"No one is going to court here," says one of RPG Byty's employees and a man on the street in front of the client centre gives her at least some right.
"I have 13,000 (krones) pensions, of which 5,000 are left for food, where should I take the money for a trial," he says.
Then the employee will be insecure.
"Look at this."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them about the media, they shouldn't sign and so the people wait yet," she says.
According to RPG Byty, the increase in rent is an economic necessity in most of the Czech Republic for the new year 2011 and RPG Byty.
"The existing level of rentals is not even sufficient for the maintenance of the housing fund," said Pavel Klimeš, the director of the housing portfolio of the company RPG Byty, and - precisely the neglect of the housing fund criticised by the tenants is, in the opinion of the owners, the main reason for the increase in rent.
While RPG was able to invest four billion in the apartments between 2005 and 2010 out of the rented rentals, in the four years from 2011 to 2014, it is expected to be 5.2 billion.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstered armchairs in the waiting room of Havířov, a few red glowing information appear in between.
"The rental increases in 2011 by 15% and less concern 31,200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of the apartments of RPG."
"Always this means a maximum of 7.50 CZK per square metre and month" can be read on the LCD monitor.
Only in 400 apartments from the portfolio of RPG, rent increases by 38 percent.
"In these cases it is about increasing extremely low rental prices of 19.66 CZK per square metre," argues RPG.
For 2600 apartments, the rent will remain at the same height next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation does not jump into the height of rents, but gradually takes place within four and eight years.
What is more - the company imposes a further obligation: all the revenues from the rental increase (see diagram) wants to put the company back into the apartments, especially in thermal savings - into new windows and into the thermal insulation.
But - priority should be given to those people who sign the agreements on the tenant increase.
The architects saw - the office also includes a kindergarten
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a kindergarten here, with everything that includes: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini playground on the outside terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to the staff of Arch.Design since last year.
The design and architecture office Arch.Design, from which studios come a number of well-known Brno buildings, calculated from the first designs for the new Avriopoint building with the premises for its company mini-kindergarten.
In wise perspective, because most of his 90 employees are in the Babyboom-age and the company is based on the fact that the projectors return to their workplace as soon as possible.
Together with the possibility to work shorter, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of its social program.
The construction engineers have so much easier to keep their demanding profession and child care under control.
The Minikindergarten is an original idea of Arch.Design's employees and with the support of management, they managed to win funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The operational kindergarten is financed by the Human Resources and Employment Policy Operation Programme from the European Social Fund and from the Czech Republic's national budget.
This funding (subsidies amounting to CZK 2.8 million) enabled the necessary facilities and equipment to be purchased and qualified staff and operations to be provided for a period of 2 years.
After the utilization of the funding (2 years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue operating the Minikindergarten for 3 more years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took place for a whole year, with the Company Economy Rating providing strong assistance in the processing of applications.
The children take care of fully qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can visit children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is about a mini kindergarten, only 5 children can be present at the same time, but the day over several children changes from one to the other.
The kindergarten facility is flexible to the needs of parents, the children of all employees have the same rights regarding the use of kindergarten - without regard to the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is individual education and care, the content of the programme in the mini-kindergarten is nevertheless comparable to the framework programme of pre-school education.
The children don't just play here, especially they are given excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to preschool education, by the way, they also learn English.
The classroom is equipped not only with toys and creative games, but also with a computer that is available to the children.
What is more - the presence of young children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment.
Parents can take a look at the children at any time and thus avoid the stress of delaying the children's pick-up from a far-off kindergarten.
Parents therefore use their working time more productively.
No wonder that natural and loyal employers-employees-relationships develop here too.
Arch.Design thus joined the Czech companies, which offer significant benefits when recruiting new employees, which are family-friendly and strengthen their personal marketing through such programs.
A bone house also fascinates after 100 years. Check out Gaudi's interiors
The roof mutates like the back of a prehistoric echse, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are torn-up fish mills.
This is Casa Batlló of Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
Of the local inhabitants, the house with its organic forms got the nickname "Knochenhaus".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile splitters and mosaics, the shed-like façades and ubiquitous soft lines, all these are typical features of Antonio Gaudi's Art Nouveau style.
The façade of the house plays with dreamy lines, tender colors and textures that remind of nature and living beings.
It is only when you look more closely that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
At night, the whole façade is still more plastic, more dramatic and the special lighting enhances the shine of the colours.
The same swinging lines and intertwined forms also dominate the interior of the house.
Wave-shaped wood copies the window frames, rails, decorative elements of doors, even holes and bars.
The house Batlló in the Eixample district on the lively shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43 was created by the conversion of a house from 1877, which architect Emilio Sala Cortese carried out.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy Industrial Josep Batlló, originally stood on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but ultimately he agreed to Gaudí's idea of an unusual and cheaper conversion.
However, Antoni Gaudí was not alone in the Casa Batlló rental house.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
The decorations for the representative apartment of the real estate owner and the use of mosaics on the facade were precisely on its rift board.
However, numerous other artists and artists also worked on the design of the façade.
The joint work on the designs for Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful cooperation between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also took part in the construction of Gaudí's House Casa Milá in the Park Güell, where there are other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after his completion, the house was given by the local inhabitants of its organic forms because of the nickname "Knochenhaus".
Others in turn called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "additional house".
It is also said that at the very top of the building was the sword of Saint Georg, the patron of Catalonia.
But other sculpture elements also symbolise hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed a central heating system with ventilating channels and typical fireplaces for the time being.
A bit bizarre, she's already mutating her 45-degree slope.
Gaudí consistently ignored all the building regulations at that time and was not guided by them.
Before the construction began, he obtained from the city the corresponding building permit but the information he provided on the planned reconstruction was so vague that two years later, the city fathers were so dismayed at the completion that they demanded relief.
The councillors, among other things, also pointed to the fact that the building with its pillars even intervened in the public sidewalk.
On the contrary, however, there was no change - only fifteen days after Josep Batlló made an application to hire the two highest floors of the house - and it was promptly granted to him.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the Gallery on the 2nd floor there was a social salon, on the 3rd floor there were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey building runs through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
Due to the basic elements of the conversion, all right angles and straight lines were removed and replaced by curved and curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept for the interconnection of rooms.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the salon doors and thus a larger society could easily chat without having to refrain from a certain intimacy in more confidential discussions.
The house was also given a rather unusual roof and two other floors by Gaudí's reconstruction besides a new façade.
Gaudí's game with the light is impressive as well as the blue and white glazed tiles, with which the courtyard is dressed and the light courts.
The game of these two colours gives all the floors of the house a maximum of light.
He simply took advantage of the principle that white reflects the light better than dark colors that absorb the sunlight on the contrary.
The House Casa Batlló, which was included in the World Heritage List of Unesco in 2005, can be visited by anyone today.
On the first floor, the most spacious and magnificent apartment is made available to the public.
The owners of the house decided only in the year to this step and this on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous Creator.
When it was found that this is a fairly onerous business, the visits were maintained, yes, they were extended to other common and attic rooms, including the roof terrace.
The price to visit the monument is not a pappenstiel, however, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and owners of tourist exhibits receive 20 percent reduction.
This amount exceeds the entry prices for other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers, try to make friends with one of the residents and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed rest? Women have other wishes than men
Not the greatest bed frame, but the quality of the deck - so mattress and rust make up the good bed.
However, they must be harmoniously complementary in order to meet the needs of the specific user.
In the selection many things play a role - the weight, the size, the state of health and, not least, the sex of the sleeper.
The interior in which mattresses and rust have to be subjected is equally important.
Typical example?
In a weekend house where latex mattresses are not regularly heated, they are not suitable because they need much longer to be "warm".
In addition, they are significantly heavier than usual polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be used regularly.
If they don't have enough venting ducts in the core and still lie on a solid plate, moisture is adamant: It is therefore not excluded that they form under their mold.
Of course, the choice also plays a role in what you are used to.
Those who have spent a long time abroad, where very high mattresses with soft layers are common, will be able to get used to a low mattress with hard surface.
"Whether all the hockey players who came back from the NHL have complained to me that they can't sleep here anymore."
"For their peeled shoulders, heels and hips, they simply need a soft layer of Visco foam (Memory Foam - a shape memory polymer)."
"I recommend these people, among other things, also diabetic people who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can receive the "information" from the joints and skin poorly," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstery furniture.
That's why years ago, I've brought these mattresses with Visco foam (Memory Foam) to many ice hockey players, but also to other customers.
"Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses offer, among other things, the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don't have to be a famous hockey player to appreciate the benefits of the Visco foam.
This "wonder" actually works quite simply.
The foam optimises its hardness and shape according to the heat absorbed, otherwise, it actually lubricates on the warm body.
There's no pressure anywhere, at night you don't roll around like after a hard fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
The viscoelastic foam also offers protection against decubitus (wound fire).
When choosing the mattress size you should still count the length of the soles, i.e. 21 to 34 cm.
Man like woman, who is 180 cm tall, needs a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the sleepers should have a minimum width of 90 cm available, i.e. 180 cm together.
For single beds, for example for singles, 120 to 140 cm are fitted.
Its comfort half and also for any visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb applies to the ideal bed width: "If you are lying on your back, there should still be enough space for the slightly angled arms," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the master of the upholstery and space equipment, who has devoted himself to the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture for years and has also presented this theme to specialist schools.
With a double bed, everyone needs a own rust and its own mattress, but watch out when shopping, so that the mattresses are also equally high.
Otherwise, nothing else remains, but the rust to be installed at different heights and this is not possible at any bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with spring skeleton 15 cm, of which should be at least three centimeters to the shape layer and the fine cushion.
"With your hand or when you're hit, you can't feel the feathers," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special type of rust.
Fully padded beds with mattresses and flooring like co-developed siam twins have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and the relation cannot be washed, which is already going on and going on today.
And since one night one loses between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress slowly becomes a giant (and stuffed sieve).
This is also why professionals reject advertising slogans, which promise a lifetime of up to 25 years in mattresses, even lifelong warranty.
Every thing has her if and but.
And therefore a practical advice from the dealers: in mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width one should not spare the hygiene of the washable, retractable covers, yet it is recommended to use a mattress shoe that can be easily pulled off and washed.
Even if today mattress covers are usually made with round zippers, so that after opening you get two halves (essentially important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially done alone, often like the unequal battle between David and Goliath.
Do you have a solid plate in bed instead of a rose?
Get out of here!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Even so, they should prefer to use the plate with ventilation holes (if there are no in it) and mattresses with spring skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket springs and fine cushions.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a substrate.
Latex or sandwich mattresses (including combinations of latex and coconuts) are suitable for non-adjustable lattice rusts with 14 to 18 spring bars (Lamellas), always paying for rusts with a larger lattice number, i.e. from 28 and more spring bars, with Lordose support in the lumbar vertebral area and the possibility to regulate the lattice hardness.
There are no mattresses with spring skeletons on adjustable lamella roses, as they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to adjusting the stiffening of the spring bars, special flexible shoulder modules are also required.
This is a special fixation of the spring bars, which allows the spring bars to be pressed or even curved so that they allow the pointless inlets of the shoulder of the sleeper.
Namely for men with wide shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started to use soft spaces for the shoulder area in "men's mattresses".
The women are also thought of - they are treated with these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, pointelastic wing suspension systems (Lattoflex) or rust with pointelastic contact pads are designed with so-called multitorsion suspension.
The pressure is distributed over several points, reducing the tension.
But - if you use a bad (too big and full) pillow to the right mattress and the right rust, most benefits are lost again.
Here, too, a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, its tips should only reach up to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideally, therefore, a 50 x 60 cm large pillow appears, as it likes, for example, the Scandinavians.
In the side position, the head cushion (together with the shoulder relief zone in the rust or soft zone in the mattress) should compensate for the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something bad with the former (filled with hay) straw bags.
Modern manufacturers increasingly use natural materials or at least their additions.
The new magic word "bio" is also used in mattresses.
Instead of petroleum oils, polyurethane foams are increasingly used in the production of natural oils, such as castor oil and soya oil.
Soya is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio is called in mattresses that are their core of natural materials," explains Petr Vašíček of Tropico Plus.
But natural substances are also used in the manufacture of mattresses - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
However, you can also enjoy microcapsules that spread fresh forest or foliage dust while sleeping.
Here, too, one makes a difference between man and woman.
While a "cooling" plant extract made of birch leaves is used for men to absorb the heat and cool the body, the covers for women have "warming" effect.
Extracts from red pepper shoots stimulate the blood circulation, so the weaker sex becomes pleasantly warm while sleeping.
And today's favorites?
Mattresses made of cold foam (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore breathable as commercially usual polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the different stiffness (hardness) of cold foams and visco foams creates multiple zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hips and heels are located.
For a high-quality mattress, however, you have 7000 crowns and more to apprehend.
However, health mattresses are usually burdened with less VAT, as they are considered medical aid.
As the first Czech company, Gumotex was granted this advantage.
You can see saving on the mattress and on the rust isn't that easy.
Occasionally, there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers who offer two mattresses at the price of one.
The Magniflex brand offers the mattress duofreeze with a hidden visco foam memory for 11,990 CZK.
You get the second one for free.
It was the material temperature that initiated the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at almost cosmic pace.
No wonder, they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads during the launch.
Tempur becomes soft at heat, in a cool environment it fastens again.
Thus it adapts perfectly to the human body and distributes the body pressure optimally.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing a fire of pressure, but generally increases sleep comfort.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses, but also for other health products, such as for special foot pads intended to facilitate leg and vessel relief.
For example, local manufacturers use foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want to control people's surveillance devices to keep the kids under control
The fear of your own children is growing, and so more and more parents are considering monitoring them via GPS.
The system that was originally invented to catch cars can also locate people, which would also be helpful in such cases, as it was recently when the nine-year-old Anička Janatková disappeared.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette box, but soon it will not be bigger than a wristwatch.
Many people have put the case of the missing Anička in fear and horror, so they look for means and ways to protect their children better.
Also for the price of impairment of their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about spying around, but about an effective means of reducing the likelihood of tragedy," says Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that in individual cases such devices can be misused, for example if you put it in your pocket without knowing it, but we had no such case so far."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," Pilin adds.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what purpose the "box" serves and how to use it in an emergency.
However, child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that a child, if he does not like to wear such a thing, will simply get rid of it.
"Also very small children show great creativity when it comes to losing certain things intentionally if they don't want to be controlled."
"At first, even the mobile phones aroused great expectations among the parents, but they can be switched off just as easily as these new monitoring devices," says Bočková.
In your opinion, it is also controversial whether such an institution actually helps in the event of an attack.
"When abductions are planned, the Kidnapper practically always checks whether the child has any electronics in his/her hands that could be used to arrange it."
"Today it's the phone."
"If such surveillance devices could be used more widely, they would also be looking for them, as their sales would be accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, the criminals of the police are always one step ahead," says the psychologist.
However, it admits that similar devices can be helpful in the event of a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to the company RC Monitoring, Roberta Čech offers car and person tracking services, such a device can also help if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be set in such a way that it reports the respective position in certain intervals."
"Even if it was destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the data subject is available."
"For more expensive devices, even a tilting knife is integrated, i.e. if you fall down and remain motionless, the device immediately sends a warning under the heading," claims Mr Čech.
In his opinion, similar services could also perform intelligent mobile phones with navigation, one only needs to record a special software.
The problem with the current tracking devices is that it is either about machines in match box sizes that resemble trailers or about smaller phones.
There is always a danger of losing them.
According to Mr Pilin von der Macro Weil, in the present day one is testing devices that look like normal digital watches.
"This has the advantage that the possible attacker does not at all have to recognise that it is a surveillance or positioning device.
"Or he doesn't notice what the police have to do until a while," he adds.
No matter what direction the development is going in - to bracelets or pendants, the same technology is always used in the process as in vehicle placement.
So the combination of tracking function with the help of the GPS system (just like the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many ignition cords that you could wrap the whole Czech Republic around you but only hold for two years
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers of ignition cords, with explosive inserts lit.
In the year before, the Ministry of Defense had delivered 224 kilometers of ignition cord to the army camps.
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have provided for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of ignition cords - two, but not more than four years.
The army bought the ignition cord of the Aktiengesellschaft STV Group, a. s. for lappische 40 million crowns.
In his explanatory statement for the purchase of this huge amount of ignition cord, the Generalstab MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume the 60 kilometers of ignition cord every year.
According to the research carried out by military pyrotechnics, the MF DNES spoke of this statement that the entire army would have to undergo an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all the generals and officers of the army command to the secretaries and cleaning women.
Defense Minister Alexandr Vondra and army general Vlastimil Picek were not excluded.
Only in this way can the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometres of ignition cords be partly justified.
By the way, this length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But this too would be enough for more than ten years.
However, if the old rule of experts still applies that for the training of each new professional soldier, two metres of ignition line is sufficient, then the army has created a calming supply for the 225 years already mentioned, even in view of the increased needs of the pioneer and special units.
The soldiers of the Rapid Operations Brigade have recently complained to Vondra, Minister of Defense, that they had almost no more cartridges for handguns, so that the shooting exercises of the missing means are severely limited.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"I don't agree, either, why they're buying spark plugs from us."
But this is ultimately their decision, they will already know to what they need."
"For us, the army is a good customer to whom we want to meet as a dealer in the broadest possible way," says the sales manager of the STV Group Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, the spokesman of the Ministry of Defense, explains the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of ignition cords, that the army would have covered itself with this "muniition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký from the STV Group speaks only of a four-year term of use of the ignition cords and police and army pyrotechnics only of two years.
"In perfect storage, the four years mentioned may also be possible," admits one of them, but who wants to remain anonymous in order not to be accused of criticism of the army as a soldier.
After the duration of use, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested, whether it is still reliable and not endangering the lives of the soldiers.
These tests, however, are not for nothing, but cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the quantity discount for the 445 kilometres of ignition cord.
"They cost us sixty percent less than the last year's 244-kilometre delivery," says Peyšek, a spokesman, to inform us of the position of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
For comparison only: the annual consumption of fire cords by police officers, the ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet Brothers Army is barely over 1,500 metres in length for a few years.
And the police always order only those quantities of this ammunition that they can consume before the end of their useful life.
Already because of the safety of the pyro technicians, one also keeps open the possibility of flexible purchases of more modern and therefore reliable ignition cords.
After all, the Ministry of Defence has enormous problems in the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from times of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand-headed Czechoslovak People's Army prepared for their campaign to the Rhine.
According to the Pyro technicians who spoke to MF DNES, the Czech armed forces in a few years expect the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometers of old ignition cords, which they have today bought so "favorably".
To this day I find the contacts I have won thanks to the competition
The winning position in the "Small Entrepreneurs of the Year" competition helped Lukáš Pytloun to sell the franchise of his hotel.
Winner of the last year of the competition "Small Entrepreneurs of the Year" became Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success must be like a film scene.
Lukáš Pytlon was happy to travel.
Only abroad did he realize that there is no good room for overnight stays at reasonable prices in Liberec.
From the savings of his holiday work abroad and with the help of a bank credit, he created a build-up house with five apartments.
Considering that he was a university student in the sixth semester at the time, this was certainly a courageous undertaking.
"The price-quality ratio at that time annoyed me and so I tried to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
He rented the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers.
He immediately invested the entire winnings back into the house, which he then gradually converted to the pension with 54 beds.
Since then, in just seven years of entrepreneurial activity in Liberec, he has been able to open up four pensions, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the fourth hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year another first class hotel was added.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, which we have sold our franchise concept and other interested parties to the franchise of the Pytlon hotels have already signed up," says business number one last year.
"Great share of this license sale for operating hotels had just won in the competition "Entrepreneurs of the Year", adds Mr Pytloun acknowledgingly.
The victory has brought him greater familiarity, yes popularity in Liberec and the surrounding area.
"People recognized me on the street, often they congratulated me afterwards, and I have to say, that was really good," he recalls.
I really recommend everyone who wants to create something to participate in this competition.
You don't have to win at once either, every sighting is good.
He says that he continues to benefit from the contacts and acquaintances to which it would not have come at all.
"With some of the people I met thanks to the competition, I still have regular business relations."
In his opinion, the fame associated with the success also leans a little on each of his employees.
And he's got the seventy.
"I note with them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something that will be given general recognition."
I really don't see this as just personal success, no, that's the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name is just a little bit in the foreground," says Lukáš Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successors a quieter year than we had in Farmet
The victory euphoria was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to its goal, Farmet has the worst behind him.
The prize for the first place in the competition Vodafone company of the year last year was received by Karel Ž Цárský, the company owner of Farmet.
At that time, the jury appreciated the efforts he made to stamp a company out of the ground from the small tool building in Česká Skalice, which makes hundreds of millions of sales.
"I can say that this tribute not only encouraged me but also encouraged all my employees and strengthened our self-confidence in the struggle with the competition," says the previous year's winner.
At the beginning of the company history of Farmet was the effort to do something useful.
And then when the state offered his father Karel Ž Ž árský as compensation for the property confiscated by the Communists a small workshop for rent, he did not hesitate for long, had his career in the company in which he had worked so far, and founded his father's own company with a few comrades to manufacture plastic tubs.
A short time later, they began to focus on plant oil presses.
Within 18 years they have risen to the largest manufacturer of automatic presses throughout Central Europe.
But only because of the success in the mentioned competition and its medialization has it also entered the consciousness of non-professional publicity.
"Not only do our customers see the Farmet brand significantly more intensively, but our foreign partners also began to appreciate the fact that they are able to work with a company that has achieved the greatest success in their country," says Karel Ž
The last year, however, was not only in the sign of victory euphoria at Farmet.
The assessment was based on the company’s economic results in 2008 and part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool construction products.
The crisis, which at that time even less shook the citizens, but above all companies, reached its peak - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"Of course, we could not escape this situation."
"The sales went back by 40 percent, we had to limit production and even take on redundancies," explains Karel Ž
A viable company sometimes has to take such unpopular measures.
But it succeeded in getting the situation under control and keeping the company in the black numbers, even with lower profits than before the crisis.
In one, the company was not willing to take out investments in research and development.
"From the grant we built a research and training centre, we strengthened our presentation at international trade fairs and earned main prizes at domestic exhibitions," says Ž
Everything shows that we've overcome the crisis.
Sales are growing again and with them also the number of new employees.
"I wish this new winner a lot of joy at victory - but in a calmer atmosphere," Karel Ž
An opinion poll that resolves with unreasonable rules
The opinion poll on the "Absurdity of the Year" is for the fourth time part of the entrepreneurship competition.
Some foolish regulations have already succeeded in creating them out of the world.
The questionable winner of the next year's opinion poll "Absoluteness of the Year" was the duty to create documents available online to authorities.
For example, more than a third of not quite four thousand voice-providing entrepreneurs decided.
For example, the Social Insurance Administration requested a paper extract from the Commercial Register, even if the official could have picked it up by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the survey, this is now changing.
"In the future, the Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require deductions from the Commercial Register when checking social security contributions," said ČSSZ Jana Buraňová spokesperson.
The purpose and purpose of the opinion poll "Absoluteness of the Year" is to take all the rules and regulations under the spotlight, to meet the entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and to lift the mad.
This year, for the fourth time, this is part of an entrepreneurial competition organised by the Czech Economic Newspaper (HN) and is pleased with the growing popularity of the public.
If last year the three thousand people took part in the vote, it was already four thousand this year.
No wonder, for there are still a lot of legal obligations that only serve to hinder business activity.
"For example, as far as the number of income tax forms is concerned, we take a leading position in the world," says Karel Havlíček of the association of small and medium-sized enterprises and business operators in the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurial activity has been the declared objective of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic has 74th position in terms of business conditions, an eight-point lower position compared to the previous year.
The competition absurdity of the year was proclaimed for the first time in the year and takes place every year after the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April until the end of September.
To register, the web address www.firmaroku.cz. Afterwards, the organizer of the competition is looking for seven candidates for the "anti-price" and allows the public to vote on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ishned.cz.
It defeats the absurdity that most of the voices get.
More than a hundred, more specifically 105 meaningless rules and regulations have been notified to this year's poll.
Tips come not only from entrepreneurs but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition are, for example, provisions that maintenance vehicles for motorways and highways have to pay tolls or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets have to be provided every two years.
The list of this year's "sevens" is published on the pages of the competition.
The call for competition at the Wenceslas Square in Prague at the beginning of November is part of a happening in which people of political and public life regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the association of small or medium-sized enterprises and business operators of the Czech Republic and Petr Kužel, the president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic at the height of competition with the party.
"Where the state throws the business between the legs, there can be no real economic upswing, so it is my aim to remove at least thirty paragraphs each year that make business difficult for entrepreneurs today," said Martin Kocourek, Minister for Industry and Trade.
Efforts to create foolish arrangements from the world have a bearing.
In 2007, the people most disrupted the businessman's duty to report to the commercial officer at the location of their permanent establishment three days in advance the intention to drive with an exhibition stand to an exhibition or to Kirmes.
This obligation has been abolished by a amendment of the Commercial Law.
The obligation to receive the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the obligation to report missions of employees to the employment office to the extent of up to 30 days - was abolished by the law on them so-called "Green Card".
And - all good things are three:
For the absurdity of the year 2009, the regulation imposed on physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two scales in the speech room.
This regulation was somewhat reduced by the Ministry of Health this year - the duty to refrigerate was removed.
A new category honors socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, education or sport projects
A new feature of this year's fifth anniversary of the Competition of the Economic Newspaper (HN) is the category "Responsible Company of the Year 2010".
The fundamental idea of this competition is to promote sensible and fair businesses.
"We want to support companies that are aware of the consequences of their entrepreneurial activities on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, Regional Manager of the mobile phone company Vodafon, the caller and guarantor of this competition, as well as the competition "Rebell of the Year".
For this year's first year this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafon Company announced that companies for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is extremely inspiring and fine enough fabric for an independent article.
Although they differ diametrically in the subject matter of their activities, their efforts nevertheless have common denominator - support and consideration.
This is for example about people with disabilities, because of personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which promotes the creation of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for disabled children for 17 years.
A paper factory from Poděbrady also takes good care of its health-related disabled workers, which account for 70 percent of its workforce, for which it was honoured with the title "Responsible Company of the Middle Bohemian Region" and in the competition Vodafone Company of the Year she took third place in the context of this region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting company MiRyz Soft won, which included a fluid and also reduced working time to an average of 35 hours a week without a proportionate wage reduction.
The jury also paid tribute to the fact that the company mainly buys from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens' initiatives in their environment and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible in order to minimise the consequences of our business activities and administration for the environment," explains her managing director Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the region of Ústí nad Labem, in turn, is based on the health of its employees and therefore it has acquired them with all notebooks ergonomic armchairs and keyboards, as well as supporting their employees' home work and in corporate actions they use carting services offered by a home protected workshop.
"In addition, we support the "People in Distress" Foundation, which provides concrete help to the Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý, the representative of the company.
It is also worth mentioning the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the Karlsbad region, which contributes its employees in the form of extra buses to their pension insurance.
"We provide our employees with contributions to catering, the way of work, increasing their qualifications and holiday," says Josef Strapáč of the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Moravian-Schlesian region.
For the category Responsible Company of the year, all district finalists of the competition Vodafon Company of the year were automatically notified, which answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organizer by 15 August at the latest.
Incorrect or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organiser.
"If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the competition "responsible company of the year", but in the main competition Vodafone company of the year they were therefore not disqualified."
"A separate application only for this competition is not possible, as it is only a subcategory of the main competition company of the year," explains Karel Goldman of Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Police arrests in public procurement
In the building of the Soil Fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police have taken arrests in recent days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. was taken by the detectives in handcuffs.
The latter allegedly attempted to manipulate a recent public competition for the settlement of refund claims in such a way that the plots offered in the competition fell to a specific interested party.
Luboš G. is said to have paid half a million.
"At this point I can only confirm that the police are persecuting a person in a public competition because of the crime of fraud," said Antonie Zelená, head of the Pilsner Public Prosecutor's Office of the Právo newspaper, unable to provide further details regarding the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released by the police.
In what way he could manipulate public competition, one can only speculate about it in the light of the limited official information.
The spokesperson of the Lubomír Černá Soil Fund pointed to the question raised by Právo, the police actually made arrests in the Pilsner branch of the Soil Fund during a public competition.
"It was about a client and with no intention about one of our employees," she put it into practice.
According to the public competition, Ms Černá had the correct name "Request for the transfer of land claims under the Land Act" and would take place in cases where several applicants show interest in the land offered.
"These persons offer, in the context of the request, a higher value of their refund entitlements to be paid by the transfer than the declared land value."
"According to the claims offered, the order of potential acquirers is determined and then the Land Fund transfers the land to the person with the highest offer," explains the fund's spokesman.
Luboš G. was obviously at the disposal of information that had been notified of the request and since he himself was a legitimate person, since he had bought a number of refund claims, he offered a land interest to withdraw from the competition.
Obviously against a greasy resuspension.
This would also be an adequate explanation for why he had such a large amount of money with him in his arrest.
Luboš G. already had too good contacts with the Pilsner Bodenfonds in the past.
He also played a role in the Causa of the former head of the Václav Sankota Bodenfonds, who was prosecuted for issuing land in replacement refunds for which site decisions on construction projects had already been made.
At that time, for example, Luboš G. acquired land for public roads from the Land Fund, more specifically, where the construction of the access magistrate to the Borské pole commercial area was planned.
Later he exchanged it very cheaply with the Magistrate against a house directly in the historic center of the city, which exceeded the value of the plots far.
At the time, the town hall had to give a heavy heart to the construction project in order not to endanger it by blocking the plots.
Households' housing costs rise by a few hundred months
From January onwards households will not only have to count at higher costs for all types of energy, but also at higher water and waste water charges and for district heating and some places rents will also grow.
From January onwards, families will have to withdraw several hundred crowns more monthly from the wallet than before.
Electricity becomes up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas by 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies and in some places also consume the district heat supplies.
The electricity industry alone costs several hundred crowns a year.
Strong electricity prices have been reduced by all main suppliers, so debt is the clear promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, including from photovoltaics.
Gas is only slightly more expensive, but this is exactly when people have to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
Here, too, there are a few hundred crowns to count more per year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices for district heating vary from city to city.
Larger places in particular are planning price increases.
For example, the households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové have to pay more monthly for district heating up to 50 crowns from January onwards, more than 1000 crowns more per year pay families in Liberec.
The inhabitants of Prague, in turn, threaten 9 percent higher water and wastewater charges and this in case the city increases the infrastructure rent.
If the rent does not change, it is only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague remains among the lowest compared to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In Northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and waste water charges should increase by 7.4 percent.
Huge rental price increases are expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments, where the so-called rental regulation will cease from January onwards.
For example, the apartment company CPI Byty, which has 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rentals by a hundred percent from January onwards.
Those who do not agree with this rise in rents, the company wants to take legal interest.
Regular rentals, which are still paid in nearly 300,000 apartments today, are expected to rise by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children drunk with Fernet and Rum beer is out - it just seems too slow
Fernett, Rum and Vodka, except for a good whisky that was stolen by the father from the house bar.
These are the drinks that, after their enjoyment, Czech teenagers under fifteen need to be treated most frequently.
No exception are children who have to sleep their cat off repeatedly in the hospital.
This is reflected in the experience of doctors who are faced with similar cases in the admission of the children's departments of clinics.
"Beer or wine are completely out of fashion because it just takes too long until you're drunk."
"Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, the head doctor of the Children's Department at the Middle Bohemian Hospital Hořovice.
"Whissky, if it succeeds to remove a bottle from the house bar from the father, and if not, then at least distance or vodka.
"Wodka has the advantage of mixing it with Juice, so he doesn't smell so strong," explains the chief physician.
The speaker of Motol Eva Jurinová's faculty hospital is right.
"The most common is distance or space."
"This is today's alcohol trend, especially at primary schools."
"The same was true of Slibowitz, which was taken from home," said Jurinová.
According to Chief Medical Officer Pelikán, thirteen or fourteen-year-old drinkers in the hospitalization have long been no exception.
In front of the hospital in Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he was working for ten years in the paediatric department of Motol Hospital, where the rescue cars delivered drunken students from near and far away.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"Your career started at 12 years when she was first delivered with 3.5 per million alcohol in the blood and in combination with "Extase", the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was in the exhibition grounds in Holešovice at some dance party."
"The interesting thing was that her mother didn't find it strange that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," the chief doctor marvels.
The lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance in the incitement of their own offspring is regarded as one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, there is no real dependence on children in the true sense of the word.
"Under alcoholism, a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomena is to be understood, and this is not the case with these children."
Those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol are usually a negative family-social background characteristic," explains Chief Doctor Pelikán.
According to Ms. Jurinová, Motol Hospital spokeswoman, about forty drunk children were assigned to the local child and youth medicine department by mid-November.
However, only cases of heavy alcohol poisoning that required hospitalisation are included in the statistics.
Drunk children who are brought home after outpatient treatment by parents or, where appropriate, by the police are not registered.
In addition to the cases where children once drank such a bottle of schnaps in the school bench, Mr Pelikán believes that there are three seasonal amplitudes to which is left a hundred percent: Walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter was for two reasons - either for sorrow because of the bad testimony or for pleasure on the holidays."
"On the Walpurgisnacht, I have also experienced seven drunken children at once in the recording," says Dr Pelikán.
Paradoxically, a drunken child who spends the night under medical supervision is better off than a child who only has to struggle with an unpleasant cat the next day.
The morning’s headache, which results from dehydration and glucose deficiency, can be expelled in the hospital with a liquid-supplementing infusion of glucose and nutrients that are missing from the organism.
"They are clearly better off, because after the "glorious" experience in the evening, they wake up with a good mood without hurting anywhere."
"They're just a little confused about where they are," Dr Pelikán admits, sometimes losing the patient the good mood by counting the cost of treatment to them.
Because the transport with the life-saving car and the night in an emergency bed come well and like on a few dozen crowns.
"She and again I used this as an educational tool when I directly calculated the children at the visit, what their drunkenness cost, and that it may well happen that they have to work all the time to earn the money for one such fetish," added Dr Pelikán.
In his opinion, however, the health funds do not resort to recourse procedures to demand the necessary costs from parents to cure the drunken children.
Two training aircraft L-159 for the first time in foreign hands - in Spain
Two light fighter aircraft L-159 out of a total of five, which the Czech Ministry of Defence has exchanged for the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew to Seville City on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is located.
It's the first time that this guy's machines are in possession of a foreign army.
So far, they were only seen in maneuvers or airshows.
This is the two-seater L-159T1 powered by the Czech army.
The remaining three aircraft are L-159.
These are currently preserved in the Aero Vodochody, the broker of this business - the company Omnipol - has taken over last week.
When she physically expands the planes from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek, according to the spokesman of the Ministry of Defense, is not yet known.
The L-159 single-seater fighter aircraft were, in turn, isolated from long-term aircraft and this without further deposits and investments from the Ministry's resort.
"The double-seater L-159T1 were exchanged in its current state and appearance," said Pejšek of the Právo newspaper.
He added that the army would not have to get out without two-seat fighters, as the Ministry of Defence signed with Aero Vodochody a 200 million contract on the conversion of four superfluous L-159 into a two-seater version in May 2009.
A new plane took over the army in July, the second one wants to take over until the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed itself to deploy the fighter aircraft into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"The contract states clearly that the company EADS is the customer of aircraft L-159 and that they should be used to train pilots from NATO countries.
"It is therefore the matter of the customer, in which way he realizes the matter," said Pejšek.
The economic newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government had no interest in the L-159.
Last year, the trade in five L-159 was approved by the government of Mirek Topolánek against a Casa transport aircraft and the purchase of another aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns.
The Ministry of Defence had not signed a tender procedure for the purchase at that time, but spoke directly to EADS.
The Defence Office at that time argued that this exchange would support the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army purchased 72 machines, of which they used only 24 and the rest wanted to sell them.
By the way, Casa's purchase of the aircraft is likely to have a judicial aftermath.
The European Commission has sued the Czech Ministry of Defence at the European Court of Justice, because it should have chosen the aircraft on the basis of a full European tender and not by a single manufacturer's response.
The army has already taken over three aircraft, Casa, the last to land at the airport Kbely in fourteen days.
Longer index finger than ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than the ring finger are apparently at lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is supposed to be related to the mirror of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as an easy test for the risk of prostate cancer and this, in particular in men up to sixty," explained the co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, Professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help to determine which men should necessarily undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health strain, Ms. Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain followed more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3,000 healthy men.
With more than half of the participants in the study, the index finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
These men had the same probability of prostate cancer as for 19 percent of those men whose ring and index fingers were equal.
However, in men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent, in men up to sixty-seven, by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two mentioned fingers, which are already in prenatal age, evidently reflects the different mirrors of sex hormones the child was exposed to in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous research showed that the testosterone is precisely accelerating the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, a leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, told ČTK that this study was fleetingly known to him, yet he did not consider the relationship between the finger length and the cancer risk to be "completely proven".
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are locked
Just like most of Europe, on Thursday morning, the Czech Republic is under a snow ceiling.
On the streets and walkways lies mostly stuck snow, the winter shifters were in many places all night on the axis.
The D5 motorway between km 89 and 90 towards Rozvadov is blocked due to some accidents from trucks and cars and also the D1 at Brno in the direction of Prague "stands".
This is what Novinky.CZ said to the dispatcher of the Central Auto-Moto-Club (ÚAMK).
In km 91, a truck crashed, in km 93 two trucks came together, and in this accident there were injured.
A few cars are also located in the road pit.
There are also problems at km 185 of the D1 motorway towards Prague.
Two trucks have also collided.
The riders were supposed to leave behind Brno at km 190 or drive through Brno and arrive at km 182 at the town of Kývalka.
There are miles of dams.
An accident has also occurred on the D11 and this is immediately at the entrance to Prague.
In Prague itself there is a several centimeters thick snow cover and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
Car columns form, for example, in the district Prosek, also the street Štěrboholská is completely blocked.
The safest means of transport is definitely the metro.
The trams travel with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague Crisis Staff meets.
There are also problems with the railways and the airport.
The Czech State Railway had to cancel seven fast train connections due to snow occurrences.
Problems exist, for example, on the route Prague - Kralupy or also Prague - Beroun.
Travellers should be informed of the current situation.
Airport Ruzyně has been closed since Wednesday 11 a.m. until 5 a.m.
Most of the roads in South Moravia can only be navigated with increased caution.
To Vyškov, three side roads are completely inseparable, in the surroundings of Brno there are some snow occurrences and in the surrounding area of Blansko you are forced to use snow milling on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
Three roads are still completely blocked: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Here, too, you will have to use snow milling to clear the snow.
When they get to ride again, they can't be estimated so far.
In the Hodonín region caution is indicated in the White Carpathian area.
On the streets, which can only be scattered inert sprays for nature conservation reasons, there is a snow cover up to five centimeters thick, ČTK led.
In the Czech Republic, from two to ten centimeters of fresh snow fell, mostly in northern Bohemia - sometimes up to 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, up to 15 centimetres of fresh snow fell.
In the Czech Republic, however, it stops snowing.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon".
The American troops used a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan for the first time, known only under their code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict with the Taliban there and shift the force relationship to their advantage.
The new weapon is something like a super accurate cannon.
Their projectiles are being directed to the target by laser with a safety level of only a few metres.
The special shots of 25 mm calibre, which were developed for this rifle and contain high-explosive explosives, work practically like small shells.
The bullets can be programmed in such a way that they can explode not only in the impact on the target but at any point in their ballistic flight path.
That is, you can use it against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle - a wall or in a trench.
From above it is usually not protected, so the murderous piece of steel rain from above can easily put it out of battle.
According to Richard Audet, who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new combat rifle is the first infantry weapon to become a "intelligent" technology.
"The soldier basically assumes that he refers to the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he wins an exact viewing point, after which he corrects the angle of increase, then he only needs to press down.
"Let's say, you've measured 543 m."
"When you press down, the gun charges and shoots the shot at distance 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs will be shifted
The Fujitsu Group relocates its subsidiary in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their workplace from the former office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu moves its subsidiary in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 women and men will move their workplaces from the former office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park, which is a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Frankfurt district of Niederrad.
A spokeswoman from Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, there should be another 100 jobs in the Group, which had so far been distributed across the region.
The rental offer had been extremely attractive, and the large offices in Astro Park would be better suited to the staff’s working methods.
Fujitsu had only been tenants in Bad Homburg.
The responsible manager Bernd Wagner said, "With Frankfurt-Niederrad we found a central location with excellent infrastructure".
The excellent connection to the airport was particularly important for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important company within the region brought yesterday joy to the winners and disappointments to the losers.
The Frankfurt business department Markus Frank (CDU) said that a "global player" had been won again.
This was a "big place confession".
Fujitsu went to the city that the settlement was an important impulse for Niederrad.
The Mayor of Bad Homburg Michael Korwisi (Greens) regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
The city had been informed early by the management of the intention.
"We offered our help to the company of course," Korwisi said.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property at Marienbader Platz.
Finally, economic reasons would have resulted.
Now it is about preventing a long void in such prominent places.
"I hope the owner and owner of the building is shown to be cooperative."
The formerly used house at the town hall square and the neighbouring "Small Vertical" were among the most controversial construction projects in the spa town with the remaining buildings at the Marienbad square ten years ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city centre was created between the railway station and the town hall, which provided criticism both because of the massive construction of the previously partly used parking spaces and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consultancy and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was still connected to Siemens, took over the houses.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were purchased by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien- Chancen Group together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund in 2006 and sold one year later to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu consumers in Tokyo are known as the third largest IT provider in the world.
It provides companies, for example, computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The branch office in the Rhein-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but much more employees are in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the subsidiary of Fujitsu Technology Solutions is recruiting in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the other subsidiaries at this location are to be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, 7000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park office building.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name is based on its star-shaped layout - the Central Association of Electrical Engineering and Electronics Industries, among other things, has its seat.
Amazon Locks Server - Threats Against Assange
Wikileaks are becoming increasingly distressed.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
This may be due to political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomats.
Wikileaks founder Assange allegedly stopped in England.
The Wikileaks disclosure platform is increasingly under fire in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
The prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's flags, is supposed to stop after a newspaper report in Britain.
"Wikileaks is displaced by Amazon servers."
"Free speech in the Land of the Free", the disclosure activists informed Twitter via short news service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company Amazon had banned Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) for publishing the secret diplomatic depex to manage the high access numbers to the documents.
On Twitter Wikileaks further explained: "Prima - our dollars are now spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon had such a problem with freedom of speech, "they would stop selling books".
Amazon stopped using its servers through WikiLeaks, after employees of Senator Joe Lieberman had conducted research, the TV station CNN reported on Lieberman's office.
The president of the Senate Committee on Home Affairs had threatened Amazon with a boycott, reported the British "Guardian".
"I would have liked Amazon to take this measure earlier given the previous publications of classified information by Wikileaks," said the Senator.
Lieberman then called on the platform to deny use to servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks' illegal, unruly and ruthless action puts our national security at risk and endangers life around the globe," said a report by the partyless senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in its efforts to spread stolen material."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is sought by the authorities in Sweden for suspicion of rape, is on the Interpol flags.
According to a report by the London newspaper "The Independent", 39-year-old Australians in Britain, the exact place is known as Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always called the investigation in Sweden an intrigue of his opponents.
WikiLeaks spokesman Kristin Hrafnsson said in London there were threats.
"There were even calls after a murder of Julian Assange."
Therefore, Assange feared for his safety, said Hrafnsson.
The WikiLeaks founder will therefore remain hidden.
Hrafnsson obviously responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had called for the head of Wikileaks to be tried and executed for treason.
In Canada, a director of the government, Stephen Harper - apparently ironic - said on television, Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone".
Between the White House and Assange, there was a shock exchange.
The speaker of American President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "stupid and absurd" that Assange had called for the resignation of Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton if she is responsible for recent espionage requests to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we're taking care of a guy's opinion on a website," says Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more significant than its website."
The US government is now fully examining the protection of its databases.
As Special Representative, the Vice Director of the Center for Anti-Terrorism Measures, Russell Travers, announced the White House.
Travers was responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" that had become necessary by Wikileaks after the publication of the embassy reports.
The White House also wants ways to check how the entire government shares and protects information.
The US government also announced its intention to ensure the security of dissidents and activists should be put at risk by the Wikileaks release.
"We've done everything we can to get in touch with them," said Foreign Office spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The Eis University
At the "Gelato University" at Bologna, ice captors are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest entrance and visitors from all over the world.
Where does this whole ice cream come from?
From the Geatier and the Gelataio.
The Gelatier, in German a little old-fashioned of the ice-colditor, manufactures the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice-making.
The gelataio picks up the ice cream from the refrigerant with a spatula, spreads it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know this, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice does not come by the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Ice-University has set up the manufacturer of ice machines in 2003 to ensure that the ice cream from its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest entrance and visitors from all over the world.
However, there are also several-day special courses around chocolate ice cream and internships in the house's own ice cream parlor.
Some dream in the midlife crisis of a new career, others just dare to venture on the smooth ice of their vague longings.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the slow-food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of the industrial Ice-Cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and wants to do something own after years in a nervous job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice shelf in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil would like to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro gelatins Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
It is not only good taste but also the silky suppleness and good consistency.
Luciano doesn't forget when he's training the cream heap of national and even southern superstructure: "Italian gelato is just the best - and then there's a lot of romance."
The first step towards manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano cuts the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers into a large mixer that heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he turns a cock on the machine, and comes out a pasteurized white base cream, basis for all milk ice creams.
Immediately, the lecturer is puzzled with questions: Can ice cream be made only with natural substances without stabilizer?
How can you let your own experimentation drive?
Luciano warns against being led astray by the spirit of time.
Those who talk about ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may still have used stabilizers - most often a natural product, such as guarmin meal from the guarbone.
Of course one can make ice without a stabilizer, only then it has to be sold within one day, otherwise it will sink together, and the customer bites on loud ice grains.
Certain variations on the base mass are allowed.
It gets more exciting with the aromas.
For the taste in the ice, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that you buy in the fruit department or at the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
"The suppliers will all try to turn dozens of aromatized additives on you."
"But you should just experiment."
Either with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or at the ice cream from the white base mass, which becomes with eggs to the yellow cream and with cocoa powder as the basis for all possible chocolate seductions.
Now the students are allowed to use the ice machines.
Luciano lets them produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice - with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural additives.
The same experiment is also subjected to the fruit ice varieties.
More flavourings, more fruit purée - this is not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily taste more nutritious when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular Kiwi ice makes the working group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture correctly highlights the taste of a gelato, says Luciano.
Eishing is a calculation task: If peach purée is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content must be reduced in the basic recipe.
An extra portion of sugar is required for lemon ice.
Luciano produces a device by which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (wines thus measure the barley in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables make it easier to calculate.
To make ice no longer requires as much physical use as before.
Not only does the device help to produce the basic mass automatically.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is creamy beaten and cooled at minus temperatures.
All automation in spite of small breakdowns do not go away.
The Brazilian Gustavo complains about himself and his fellow students from top to bottom with fruit purée, when the overdimensional stick mixer goes out of control.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time until such a thing happens."
On-board tell-tales
The European Food Authority, EFSA, was underpinned by the industry experimenting with gene plants.
This accusation is now formulated by the expert group Testbiotech, which sees itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," said Testbiotech Chief Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the EFsa expert group on genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another EFsa expert have been under contract with the Ilsi Lobbyist Association for years.
It is paid by corporations such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has been a major contributor to the EFSA testing regulations for gene plants and is thus in a clear conflict of interest, criticised Then.
The Efsa Regulations were worded equally with Ilsi's position papers and thus the industry's manuscript, which is actually to be checked by the Italian Parma authority.
It was already the second time that Testbiotech had a conflict of interest.
A high-ranking Efsa manager has recently been a Syngenta member of the Swiss Agrarian Group without any conditions or transitional period - and has thus changed the pages.
The Central German Radio (MDR) has also recently revealed staff links between controlling EU authorities and industrial lobby, which has made the Federal Environment Agency and EU Parliamentarians heard lightly.
However, the EFSA cannot recognise any conflict of interest.
The opinion states that all serious data, including those of industry, are taken back as long as they are of high technical quality.
The experts who work for Efsa do not demand that they have no contact with the industry.
But they would have to disclose them.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
This calls itself a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - among other things, on the risk assessment for biotechnology without a lobbying mandate.
In this regard, independent experts such as Then criticise that genetically modified plants are currently authorised without any feeding attempt in animals and that the response of plants to environmental influences is not tested.
"We want to know what makes, for example, genetically modified maize on the field," says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the whole gene plant, which does not produce reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how do you find them?" then asks Then accusing.
Angelika Hilbeck sees that as well.
The scientist has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at Zurich University of Technology.
In this area, as in the USA, industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe.
There are therefore hardly any researchers who are not associated with corporations.
For companies critical studies would usually not be published.
"Industry controls security research," says Hilbeck.
The trail of the stones
Uli Gsell has also been worried about, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening he stood as Stuttgarter Bahnhof, the tuba on his back.
It was demo.
It's snowing.
The story is known: In September, the excavators were turned and had begun to break off a large piece of the north wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: thousands of people protested against S21, the billion-dollar laying down of the railway station.
When it came to the construction stop, most of the wing was in debris.
Broken into 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheim muschelkalk, a soft coarse stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in East Fildern, 43 years old.
He made sure of some of the pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"You can't go away."
He swears: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthy."
When he saw one, he smelled cigarette-like.
He doesn't know what he's going to do with the stains yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The trail of the Stuttgart stones leads into a forest near Tübingen on a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone kingdom.
The 44-year-old deals with old stones.
He bought all those that went down at the crash in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame that they would be ground into gravel or disappear in the landfill," he says in his office, a wooden pen, which was once a guard's house.
He said that he was being reproached and threatened when, in September, the newspapers said that he had bought the rest of the North Wing from the break-up contractor.
But he talked to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he told them that he couldn't do anything for the crash.
And if it happens, then it would be the most reasonable thing if the stones were to be reused.
Some 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the average 80 kilos of quads, unit price 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, but also in the hope of being able to return him in a reconstruction.
500 tons had bought Rongen, 25 large truck loads.
About half of the stock is still in the forest, the rest has long been sold.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, hauslebauer.
They had come from all over, and had tossed away what the trunk and the trailer could carry.
The Stuttgart stones of the incitement have long since turned into "Mäuerle" or into limits of herb beet.
"Actually, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"Wouldn't be the political component."
He rises in his off-road car, makes a tour of his 20-hectare empire.
He studied law and quit, later biology, then he was interested in computer and finally became a stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
40,000 tons of Steine's stockpiled.
From all over Germany, he carries his treasures together.
He says he's the biggest old stone dealer in the Republic.
Braked.
In the snow lie artificially mowed sandstones.
"They once belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke," he says.
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, is swarmed.
"My favorite stone."
It goes up the path through the forest.
He shows on a pile: red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe station.
And on.
"Beautiful Travertine."
At one time the quads belonged to the grandstand of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart Police Bureau, red granite from the Cathedral of St. Blasien, Tuff from the Heilbronner Hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones used to be cut by hand and moved with simple bottles and ox carts, he becomes quite venerable.
"It would be a scandal if you were to scrape something like that."
He didn't get rich, he didn't get rich at all.
But 14 people are employed by the stone merchants today, as well as in the forest of Steinmetze, a sculptor, a forge, a glass blower and a gardener.
"We're working hard, but it's satisfying," says the residual intruder.
Soon he will have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to save.
Talent match for high potentials
There's a government rush at the buffet.
16 students insist on salmon bread, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Autobauer Volkswagen have invited the mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a sort of idea competition, they are supposed to learn about the car of the future together with VW developers - and by the way, they are supposed to learn about Volkswagen.
In the competition for the smartest minds, many companies are now going to the close battle and, like VW, are going to cooperate with the universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most talented graduates as early as possible in the auditoriums before they come to the labour market and are recruited by others.
And because the universities don't publish essays about the achievements of their students, one tries to explore and bind the exceptional talents in practical projects.
On the second day of the workshop at TU Braunschweig, the car group turns around the talents.
A young lady from the personnel department distributes ballpoint pens, rubber bears and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talent of internship programs and student jobs and shows them ways in the group.
Nico Selle von der TU Braunschweig manages the project with VW.
He sees the advantages for both sides: "The students come into contact with the industry and gain experience."
"VW can get to know students at the same time, look at interesting candidates and think about who would be in question as employees."
Such cooperations, according to Celle, are not unusual.
New is the fact that students are so aggressively squandered.
"Otherwise, the focus was on the technical project," says Celle.
The fight for the fresh graduates will probably get even harder.
In many industries, companies are no longer able to select their employees from a large number of applicants.
But they must be commended and, in particular, highly skilled workers.
Above all, graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Federation of German Engineers VDI, over 40,000 engineers remained unoccupied in October.
And the so-called engineering gap is getting even bigger according to VDI forecasts.
Roman Dykta goes to the talent hunt for the KPMG audit and consultancy company.
He organizes elaborate recruiting events such as the KPMG Race, a kind of modern carving team where participants need to find their way using GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company across the United States next year.
By the way, participants can view KPMG file and get to know the company.
Those who are allowed to join will decide in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the crème de la crème of the many applicants flies to the USA.
When the high potentials at the universities are pierced and cut, the guns, according to Dykta, are getting bigger.
"We want to stand out with the race."
"Only a simple sailing session was too little for us."
Talent hunter Dykta seems to be billing.
"We are still in contact with all the participants of a similar action last year."
"Some people are just about to graduate and want to apply with us soon," he says.
In addition to the direct booming on the campus, small and medium-sized companies also go to Pirsch classically at trade fairs.
"We try to reach graduates at trade fairs."
"Etwa on the Intersolar", says Sitha Stübe, HR manager at the solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn company employs around 1500 people in Germany.
Dust knows about the problems of young people.
Currently, 35 jobs are posted on the company website.
"It's just very hard to occupy beautiful positions."
"It takes a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"Professors indicate that we can do internships or write their diplomats."
Expensive promotions are not sought by the solar specialist.
To this end, the company tries to advertise with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and light communication.
"A large group often cannot offer this," says Staff Manager Stübe.
Money is no longer the main role in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good access are other crucial factors.
In a study by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld took 55th place among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute creates an annual best list of German employers.
It asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and job environment and looks at the framework conditions for the employees.
Staff manager Stübe also expects positive points from the placement to the job seekers.
"I think that applicants especially look at external reviews of a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employee Branding Academy advises companies who want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to increase their authenticity.
And that means, according to warriors, mainly internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through his own employees," he says.
In the jargon sector, the internal employee is called branding, i.e. employer branding within one's own workforce.
" Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
If you treat his people well and identify them with the company, they would advertise for their employer on their own.
"This is like a game with bands," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the coming years off the coast of the US state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico.
A corresponding ban has been imposed by the Washington Government - and thus their earlier plans are finally revoked.
Also in front of the Atlantic coast, new drilling will be prohibited for the first time.
This was announced by Ken Salazar, Minister of the Interior, on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which should apply at least for the next five years, is the explosion of the deepwater horizon drill platform in April.
Before the disaster that cost eleven workers and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico at the pressure of opposition and industry.
The supporters want to reduce the dependence of the US on oil supplies from abroad.
Those who bear the responsibility for the devastating oil plague in the Gulf have not yet been finally clarified.
At the heart of the criticism is the British energy group BP, which is faced with billions of demands.
A committee of inquiry on Obama's behalf is due to present its results in the course of December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar had lifted the drilling stop that was imposed after the explosion.
Subsequently, several oil companies had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and stricter security regulations, Obama and Salazar want to exclude a new catastrophe.
At present, the competent control authority, which has been convicted of numerous corruptions, is fundamentally reformed.
In parallel, Obama announced to close lucrative control loopholes for oil and gas corporations.
The industry is now publicly warning that more stringent regulation would significantly reduce the amount of funding in the Gulf.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry," is the result of a current industry survey by the consultant company BDO - before the drilling ban of Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complains of the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows exactly what will change with regulation."
Investments in new funding projects would be postponed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is burned down
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like the gas station: billions of liters of oil spilled out have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live from theft, corruption and illegal oil boils.
Celestine Akpobari thinks it's good.
"Don't worry about it," the eco-activist reassures the journalists: "You're going to get enough oil sludge in front of the lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has followed the attempt to light a boy waving up to the breast in the water with the veils surrounding him: In the rainbow-coloured water shines the scene almost pretty.
It is not to be seen that under surface brown crude-oil swaths hover.
Earlier she used to pick shrimps here, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the drained flowing waters were completely dead.
Five years ago, a brushed pipeline poured raw oil into the huge wetlands.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now need to row six hours in order to get into fish-containing waters: The Ogoniland located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the world's worst devastated regions.
On the journey through the mangrove swamps through the rivers, the entire extent of the destruction becomes obvious.
Instead of light water, the motorboat swells brown broth, who dips his hand into the water pulls oily fingers out.
The roots of the mangrove trees rise like black licorice rods from the ground, sadly making the palms to come hang their wings individually.
Bird swarms, as they are otherwise common in wetlands, are in vain: As soon as the outboarder hovers, the former paradise, which smells like a gas station, spreads out ghostly tranquillity.
"What happens here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari doll: "We live in constant danger of health."
The comparison of war is appropriate.
The Ogoni settlement area is a battlefield fought for decades: the first explorers from Europe invaded here more than 60 years ago, and in the 1980s the first resistance was organized with the later excavated writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, where the Shell Group had to stop production in 1993 because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Today, the company is still refusing to return to Ogoniland: While more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped daily from the entire Delta region by the triple size of Switzerland with more than 5000 drilling sources and 7000 kilometres of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland broke, too unstable the company is the location.
All pairs of hundreds of meters of steel frame such as bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christian trees" the heads of the drill holes are called far too tender.
They are up to 50 years old, most corroded to the mark.
Again and again such a wellhead breaks apart, says Akpobari, then a constant stream of crude oil flows into the water.
More than two billion liters have been transferred to the Delta's ecosystem in 50 years, according to expert estimates: year after year the amount of oil, as it forced 21 years ago into the ocean in the atmosphere of the Supertanker "Exxon Valdez", one of the largest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
Those who are responsible for the continuing eco-GAU will argue about it.
While the shell group Sabotage and the organized oil theft are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see bursting drill heads and leak pipelines as the main cause.
Shell applied much lower safety standards in Nigeria than usual in the world, U.S. scientist Richard Steiner proposed to the Group in 2008: The rate of defects on the lines alone is "a lot higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks like a deserted, oil-stained workshop under the open air, emerges from the mangrove shapes: they are split-naked and lubricated to the neck.
Under one of the many barrels connected partly with pipes, partly randomly scattered on the site, a fire flares: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, gasoline penetrates through the pipes, later dripping at the end of the line of kerosene and finally diesel out.
For example, Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of diesel of 300 litres a day: "This brings us 34,000 Naira" - about 22 dollars.
Delta residents use the chronic fuel shortage in the largest petroleum state of Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The ridiculously low price of diesel fuel with just under 40 Euro cents per litre can still subsist the illegal cookers: because their raw material is free of charge.
He comes from "bunkers", who tap the pipeline network across Ogoniland: According to experts in the whole of Niger Delta, at least 16 million litres of crude oil are lost every day.
However, only a small part of the temporary intermediate raw material is illegally refined: the lion's share of organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military, fill tankers and scramble it on the world market.
The debate as to whether the environmental catastrophe is more due to the population's revolutions or the lax mode of production, the activist Akpobari believes it is purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if they had not so thoroughly destroyed the fishermen's livelihood, there would be no sabotage, theft and illegal refining."
In the meantime, the Ogoni relationship, above all with Shell, was so destroyed that only a deduction from the Group would be called into question: "Perhaps other nationalities, such as the Chinese, appear to be better."
Michael's getting nervous.
"Maximum time you're disappearing," says the muscular oilman.
"Every minute, the soldiers can come."
If illegal oil refiners are caught by the special unit of the armed forces, they may not be threatened with arrest, but they may have a painful lubrication.
The soldiers from the Nordic countries, like all Nigerians, also want to benefit from the raw material.
"This damn stuff has brought our country to the dog in every way," says Akpobari.
Detectors Detect Hazardous Building Errors in A380 Engines
The A380 has apparently a major security problem.
Investigators have discovered a possible build error during the investigation of a distressed machine, which could lead to a "disastery engine failure".
The Qantas airline now wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the nearby Qantas-Airbus at the beginning of November were apparently much more fortunate than they have been before: the Australian Air Safety Authority has identified a major safety problem in the engines of some A380 engines - and is now warning of a possible construction error.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: in the case of an oil hose connection, it could produce fatigue cracks and leaks, it was stated in an ATSB opinion published on this Thursday.
This could have led to "a catastrophic engine failure".
The A380-Series were concerned with engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce.
This includes the Qantas-Airbus, which had to land in Singapore on November 4th.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the UK turbine manufacturer.
It provided a ground of appeal at an Australian Federal Court in Sydney which enabled it to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas Chief Alan Joyce said that his airline would claim compensation for the incident in early November.
In the fire of the engine parts had been dissolved and the bearing surfaces damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire a cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines need to be replaced worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced that they would conduct further safety tests on the superjumbos equipped with the engines concerned.
The safety recommendation was the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The safety problem had been considered sufficiently important to inform all interested parties.
After landing the Qantas machine, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines left approximately three of its eleven A380 temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced the engine with an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The double-storey flyer is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Landwide snowfall triggers traffic chaos
Germany in white: Over night snow fell almost all over the country.
Chaos, trains and flights rule on many streets.
At least three people were killed in car accidents.
Winter frosts Germany: At icy temperatures almost the whole Republic has snowed on Thursday at night - which leads to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east there are some 15 centimeters of thick snow blankets.
On several motorways and many roads traffic is severely restricted.
At the A7 near Flensburg, the winter service was in constant use, but was not finished with the constantly fresh snow.
In addition, heavy waves swept over the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) awaits on the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the morning to storm floods with water levels of 1.2 metres above normal level.
In Saxony, the snowfalls on the motorways and federal roads caused considerable problems.
According to the weather-central meteorite, the alarm level was set violet in Saxon Switzerland - the highest level at all.
Partly there, 30 centimeters of fresh snow, fresh and strong winds were causing confusion.
Several trucks and cars stayed there at night.
In Saxony-Anhalt, too, police authorities reported major disruptions on the streets.
On the A2 snow and wind led to increased traffic and congestion.
In Thuringia, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfalls.
According to Deutsche Bahn, there are significant disturbances in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and the north of Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, curved trees on the tracks or destroyed overhead lines and bends are the main problems.
In Saxony, the long-distance service from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In the Thuringian Saalfeld, an ICE had to stop its trip to Munich.
The 165 passengers were supplied by firefighters and rescue workers with woolen blankets, food and drinks on the train.
Snow gushing across the streets.
At large German airports the snow winds lead to numerous flight failures.
According to a spokesperson of the Flight Information Center, some cancellations have already been reported in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, 40 flights have already been cancelled, according to a Fraport spokesman.
Winter service is in continuous use.
Although only a few stranded passengers at the airport still have almost 400 field beds for them.
On many roads there were accidents already on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver came to life during a collision with a train on a train crossing in Eastholstein.
The locomotive was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred in the vicinity of Nuremberg due to snow-covered roads: a truck was also found on a railway crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
On the train four passengers were injured - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore blocked until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after crossing her car at Aschaffenburg on smooth street.
But the meteorologists have good news: Although the snow will still be softer and powdery and therefore startle with slight waves.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is hit by fast and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - local up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
The Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its landmark: according to a newspaper report, moneyhouse buyers are looking for the two office towers at their Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to EUR 500 million could be paid by the property.
The Deutsche Bank has just made its group headquarters pretty: the twin towers in the Frankfurt banking district have been modernised; in the meantime, the bankers were allowed back to their old workplace.
But now the financial group wants to recover the cost of the renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two high-rises, as the "Financial Times Germany" writes under appeal to a speaker.
The speaker did not mention reasons for the proposed sale.
"We always check whether it makes sense to own or sell real estate and then rent it back," he said.
Germany's largest credit institution has already given up its registered office after a short period of time.
The bank had taken over the double towers only in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of a domestic fund and then refurbished them extraordinarily.
The energy conversion increased by around 200 million euros.
I think a sale would bring a lot of money to the bank.
Industry experts estimate the value of the recently renamed Green Towers, according to the newspaper's towers, of around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are resold to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor is still open, the speaker said.
Thousands of mourning for dead mates
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the shattered miners who have been declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
Still the bodies could not be secured because the security situation in the accident shaft is still precarious.
Almost two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were thrown under days.
A probe had been dropped into the accident shaft, but no trace of survivors had been discovered.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, rescue forces could not descend due to safety reasons.
After the second severe detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that there was no longer any chance of survival for the mates.
The bodies could not be hidden so far.
Now, relatives and friends remembered the dead with a commemorative celebration.
Ten thousand people had gathered at radiant sunshine in Greymouth on the New Zealand South Island.
For two minutes, they're silent.
In the name of the shattered miners there were set up 29 tables, on which there were helmets, lamps, and the names of the pals.
Pictures and personal items, including clothes and surfboards, also took their place here.
In front of the government buildings of the country, the flags were half-mast.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would come back to the surface "from the depths of the earth", said the New Zealand Prime Minister John Key to the participants of the commemorative celebration.
"But they never came home."
He cannot conclude with the death of his son as long as he did not see his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and members of the victims, several foreign diplomats participated in the commemorative celebration.
During the first explosion on 19 November, British and South African origins had also been shattered.
Rescue workers began to eliminate a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases were removed, the glowing temperatures inside the mine began to cool down, police president Gary Knowles told journalists.
Son of a bitch, warrior!
Does the Splatter fit the Kunstkino?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn lotet with his fighter-epos "Walhalla Rising" new old genre boundaries.
Which audience might the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A captive Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and, with almost superhuman forces, turns around his opponents in sequence - sounds ideal for young male spectators in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use rabid killing methods and rips his enemies' breath out of the living body when he has bad mood.
On the other hand, Einauge says, as he is actually called, the whole film over no word, and also the other characters can at most be torn to one or two sentences or a few painful death cries.
Otherwise, it is silenced and swallowed up in the horrific hillside landscape of Scotland, which offers the backdrop to the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
Ideal for adult cinemas with interest in existentialism and very quiet camera rides.
Nice, if a film has several target groups, only hurt if it excludes each other.
Director Winding Refn has been considered a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and stylized drug deal trilogy "Pusher" but refuses to make his works accessible to the Arthouse with a little more humor or a little less brutality.
Most art cinema friends are expected to be deterred from the surrounding brain mass and the intestines.
The action fans die of boredom at the latest, when, for free-interpretable reasons, a troop of violent Christian missionaries breaks up via ship to Jerusalem and traps an eternity in flute and fog before the crew apparently arrives in America and continues to remain silent there.
No wonder, then, that "Walhalla Rising" did not find a cinema rental in Germany and has now only appeared on DVD.
This is especially a pity because of the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to blood-squeaking façade a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
In this film it's not about dialogues or a strict act, it's all the atmosphere, a film-making fever room.
And there is no escape from this for the audience.
Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation, and with his icy pictures and the dark trance-like soundtrack, he slowly tightens his throat, but above all with the unfathomable hatred that beats him out of the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blond boy, who stands by the eyes faithfully, preserves himself such a thing as innocence, all others are driven by anger.
Mostly the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, but who eventually becomes a warrior from hell for enemies and temporary allies, possibly the ambassador of the Devil himself.
It means destruction, but perhaps only for the corrupt.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired for anger, excitement and astonishment.
An experience.
Controversy on earth
The IAEA Atomic Energy Agency has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
However, the country refuses to take a position - nor does it allow for controls.
At least four Israeli F-15 I fighter planes attack a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria on midnight 5th on September 6, 2007.
It is on the banks of the Euphrates; the nearest larger city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair As-Saur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria allegedly built in the quad with the help of North Korea, hidden in a valley that goes off the current.
According to a briefing of the CIA's foreign intelligence service at the end of April 2008, the regular reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, would have been well suited to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, however, the technique from the fifties is hardly suitable.
The CIA presented a video presentation with rough satellite images.
By computer animation, she faded in where which components of the reactor were supposed to have been before destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, she presented photographs showing the building from nearby or even the interior.
The reactor had been put into operation shortly before it was started, it was called, but it had not yet been equipped with incinerators.
Today, more than three years after the bombardment, is hardly known more than then, yes, the riddles got bigger over time.
The former U.S. president George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was quite certain before the attack that Syria built a reactor in el-Kibar, but hardly saw any indication that there was "an active nuclear weapon program" in the country.
Some secret agents in Europe prefer to be even more cautious and speak only of a "suspected reactor", even if they consider the CIA presentation "plausible".
They lack hard evidence, as do the IAEA.
Asked how sure he was to have a reactor in front of him, a high UN diplomat answered only lapidar in the summer, which IAEA had "sufficient material to ask questions".
Although the Syrians quickly set aside the alleged "unused military building", they planned the site thoroughly.
However, in June 2008 an IAEA team was found under the former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar traces of uranium, which was produced by humans.
In addition, the IAEA received via a Member State satellite images of commercial providers from the time immediately after the attack, which should be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown customer - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot therefore independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always meant never to run a secret nuclear program or have built a reactor.
The uranium comes from the Israeli weapons, Damascus explained.
However, the IAEA rejected this as unlikely after analysis of the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it - as has the satellite imagery.
In addition, it refuses the inspectors a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the debris of the bombed building.
Israel, too, is silent.
"We will never comment," recently confirmed the official position of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert in charge of the attack.
Thus, the investigation of the Falls since June 2008 has been in vain and "increasingly develops into a serious credibility problem for the Authority", as a high Western diplomat has agreed at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna - after all, there is a serious violation of the Nuclear Barrier Treaty in the area that the IAEA is monitoring.
As a key to progress in information, the IAEA apparently sees three other institutions which are supposed to be "in functional connection" with the suspected reactor - and are still existing other than this one.
Until now, the inspectors have not disclosed which plants they are, or what function they have or what they can appear suspicious of.
According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung (Süddeutsche Zeitung), they are referred to internally at the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, in turn derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these sites and has located a building complex on satellite images at Masyaf, most likely one of the suspect objects.
It may be located in or directly next to a military base - precisely on this ground, Syria of the IAEA refuses access to the three places.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent by the US to spy out military facilities.
Because the nuclear detectors had become aware of the facilities by a tip of the US secret services.
The IAEA has clues, including satellite photos, that between the three places and the quad on the Euphrates material was transported.
A high Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could be "related to fuel production".
However, there is "no evidence of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium should later be separated for the bomb, there are at least plausible assumptions about these central questions.
It is also unclear whether debris that could contain valuable traces was stored in three places.
As if the hundreds of truckloads had disappeared from the ground, no one wants information about where the shovel has remained.
The al-Tibni salt mine, located only a few kilometres from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which Syria has investigated in 1998 as a storage facility for radioactive waste, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had recently linked her to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for Jane's renowned magazine Intelligence Review.
However, photographs from the orbit show that Syria was doing earth work in the three suspicious locations and removed large containers after the IAEA had requested access.
This may be a coincidence, but it has hardly helped to dispel the suspicion.
In addition, in diplomatic circles, the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for inspections there, which should allow Syria to maintain any military secrets - only the effort shows how much interest the inspectors have.
However, Damascus also rejected this proposal.
Had Western diplomats in Vienna worried a year ago that the reactor had been destroyed, so the matter did not have a high urgency, for example U.S. ambassador Glyn Davies has brought so-called special inspections into play for a few months, one of the strongest means the Viennese nuclear authority has had to enforce controls.
Although IAEA Chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken about "an option for which I am open in the future", he is still reluctant.
There is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the Board of Governors of the IAEA, and on the other hand, some of the 35 countries represented there are anything other than seeking an escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat says, "What if in the end they find nothing?"
Love in Times of War
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her still nameless directorial debut in the summer, there has been a lot of trouble.
The script itself wrote it, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
You don't know much more about it - but that's enough for rest.
The rumor, the woman, a Muslim, persists in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslav war.
Bosnian women's organisations have protested immediately, and some of the film days planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary in the short term.
In the meantime, the film has been turned off in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still being protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the organization of female war victims wrote about UNHCR's UN refugee aid to Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, has now reported a Bosnian newspaper - Jolie is himself an ambassador of the UN refugee relief work.
Diplomatic is not she - she offered women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they rejected it.
The meeting had to take place in Bosnia, according to Hasecic.
Love stories in rape camps did not exist, and Jolie's attitude to the victims told her enough about the screenplay.
According to her organization, she recommended to the UN refugee relief work that Jolie be released as an ambassador, says the Guardian.
What exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, who got to read her script, has issued a motion picture for Sarajevo after a few years - it's not quite clear why Jolie didn't come anyway.
The young author himself claims that she does not pursue political intentions with her film, has worked with a lot of effort in the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all the parties involved.
However, it remains vague about the content.
This is how a second synopsis on the web will be shown, which then sounds quite different: The lovers knew themselves before the outbreak of war and met again when they, a Bosnian Muslim, were dragged into a Serbian camp in which he worked as a guard.
What sounds significantly different than the "Crime Sacrifice of Rape" variant.
That Jolie's film actually starts before the war - so much is certain.
The pressure on her, Jolie said, was "unfair and based on misinformation".
Now you can only get the hackers of Hollywood peace: by placing the screenplay, as so many had done before, illegally on the net.
Nothing like this.
This evening it will finally run around for the Irish again.
No sign of fraud.
The home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much for this.
The fans cheer for joy with loud loud music, they stamp with their feet.
The Bailey-Pub in South Irish Cork trembles because the players throw table tennis balls over a three-meter distance in beer cups - and meet.
"Bierpong" is called the bizarre spectacle, to win there is 500 Euro win premium plus tickets to Las Vegas for the beer pong World Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this shrill drinking game and the restraining computer scientist, that doesn't really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old is trying to amuse himself by distracting himself from the question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not to have fun playing in Las Vegas, he will be conducting application interviews in New Zealand in January.
"I have a mullous feeling," he says.
"It's so far from home and yet I don't have any work there."
After all, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had jerks, picks up her job as an event manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of bad perspectives at home, two of Tanner's three siblings have already sought their happiness abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a position as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: Like the tanners, it looks like on the island in many families.
100 000 Irish will probably be leaving the country in the near future, say experts from the ESRI Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin.
By 2015, they even expect 200,000 immigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a violent loss.
If forecasts are maintained, a wave of emigration is comparable to that in which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of the upswing that brought with it great prosperity for yours, it is now beginning to grow sad.
The economic crisis is particularly worrying about the young, well-trained Irish, for which it has so far only gone uphill.
Job losses and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, there was money in abundance.
In the meantime, however, three out of ten women and men are under thirty without work.
In the Irish Times there are a lot of readers' letters from young emigrators who complain: "Everything goes down the stream in Ireland."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but who can go away and our country loses a whole generation."
"The last one, please, turn off the light."
Jura student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, sees a gloomy future emerging, because the government only conducts eyelashes and offers young people no longer prospects for the future.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they do not have a strategy for creating new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
They observe their commissions hanging from unpaid practice to the next.
Her greatest concern, she says, is to have to emigrate in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to get a positive start on the subject.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that provides a round-the-clock service on the topic of working abroad.
"For professionals, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career manager," says the manager.
On his website show photos surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a galley service, but also brings freedom and fun.
As it feels like building something else, Seán O'Donovan knows for half a year.
Because there was nothing to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen they are just pulling up a fashion house.
In January we continue to Hanover or Berlin, the next project.
His home now sees O'Donovan only rarely, because he makes extra layers to pay off the loan for his house at home.
"The situation is a bit crazy," he says, when he stepped over the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I am almost never."
He laughs at something shy and goes through cooled rooms.
The small house stands in a fine residential area with well maintained courtyards, in the entrances parking large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent of the money.
"There were crazy times, there was simple money without many questions," he says.
Is he afraid that the loan might go wrong?
O'Donovan ponders for a while, pours hot tea and says, "I don't have any children I have to feed through and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start again."
The construction engineer doesn't like wailing, which he hears often at the moment.
"No one has to starve - our situation is far from as dramatic as it was in earlier times here on the island," he says.
"Work abroad for a while, that's not the worst thing that can happen - perhaps we only feel like Irish."
He laughs and then tells about his father who went to England in the last major economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life continued in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Open the future and just watch how it goes with life elsewhere.
A few years of work in London, he's already behind him, and why shouldn't it be good for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But one thing is still worrying about him these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
He's afraid it might turn into a party of good fortune.
"Only too many emotions," he says and drinks a big sip of his beer.
"Sorry, that sounds scary."
"Let's call it a day off, easy, with some friends, some drinks, some games."
The Democratic Routine
The democratic movement in Latin America is becoming stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States.
The Latinobarometro survey, conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist, produced these results.
This survey has been conducted regularly since 1995 and thus shows the exchange of views in this region.
Two facts are particularly visible in this year's September and October survey.
First, the good mood in Latin America
Secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions.
In many countries on the Pacific coast of South America, the democratic movement has increased sharply (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by around 6% annually since 2002, the number of democracy supporters rose from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Also in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the strong collapse last year, such a trend can be seen.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, reducing the regional average (see Graph 2).
About 44% of the respondents said that they are satisfied with the democratic practice of their country. These are as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Figure 3).
About 34% trust the congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to those of last year, but show a marked increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
A decade ago, Latin America’s economic crises undermined efforts to increase democracy.
This may have been due to the fact that the countries of Latin America have only experienced a short recession and recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor were caught up by a stronger social network.
(According to reports from the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America rose only slightly in 2009 and fell again by 32% this year.)
However, there are strong differences of opinion from country to country (see Graph 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread sense of progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and violent, this is less so.
For the second time since the start of the survey, many Latin American respondents see a bigger problem in crime in their country than in unemployment (see Graph 5).
About 31% say that either they themselves or a family member have been victims of a crime last year. However, compared to 38% last year, the values have fallen and thus reach the lowest level since 1995.
The rise in economic performance is reflected in the stronger support for the private and market economy: around 71% of respondents over regionally indicated that the private sector is indispensable for development; in 2007 there were 56% (see Graph 6).
About 58% said that only the market economy can make progress with its country, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private sector), although their left president, Hugo Chávez, has established many private companies.
Brazil, according to 19% of respondents (18% last year), has the highest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
The respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, on the other hand, see the most influential country in the United States, with this role being taken over in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua from Venezuela.
An Electoral Sleep
Nobody expected the elections to be perfect in Haiti on November 28.
But the facts exceeded the fears of the electoral helpers who were trying to help the affected country.
Overcrowded ballots, multiple votes, ballots in the cinnamon, destroyed polling rooms and intimidation were only part of the problems.
Election venues opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless through the January earthquake, ran around looking for an option.
Some finally gave up altogether.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some suspected top riders, demanded that the election results be lifted because of a alleged fraud.
There were some violent protests across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, called the election "a rather good choice in many respects".
According to a cautious statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, "these irregularities, as serious as they may be, do not necessarily invalidate the process".
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, allegedly obliged to the unpopular President René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected turnout is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, the rap musician Michel Martyly and the former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial ineffectiveness charges.
If Jude Célestin, who has little or no agreement with the voters, explains this to the electorate as the winner of the election, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million victims of earthquakes are still living in tents, a low turnout was feared.
On the election day, many Haitians were hindered by lack of organization in the vote.
Shortly before the start of the election, approximately 250,000 certificates were not yet distributed, which are required for the election.
There's a lot at stake.
The donor countries regard a legitimate, recognized government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves share the same view.
Secret in the middle
In the weeks following the sudden death of your husband, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, learned a wave of sympathy that pushed her popularity rate up by 20 points over 50%. That's the highest value since her election in 2007.
However, whether you are helping this for a re-election next year depends on whether the seemingly grieving Cristina Fernández is more compromise-making than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Nestor Kirchner.
The signs of this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who also guided his wife's economic policy, often drew up budgets that did not take full account of tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the pair of presidents to spend the extra revenue on their own discretion.
On paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided, and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further denunciations.
Some regime critics from the ranks of the ruling peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (in which one parliamentarian struck another in the face and others accused the government of bribery), the Congress failed to adopt the budget for 2011.
"I won't discuss it," said the president.
The 2010 budget now also applies to the next year, which gives the President even more opportunity to spend money on his own account.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate, for example, is 11.1%, but numerous private estimates - and wage demands of trade unions - are worth almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took over the office in 2003, when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, explained growth and poverty reduction to its main objectives, rather than the reduction in inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector and cleaned up the National Institute for Statistics and Population INDEC, which then looked forward to official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández take a moderate path now?
It called on the private sector and the trade union leaders to talk.
And official statements suggest wage increases are to be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have boosted the economy.
However, inflation undermined the momentum of growth through a large deevaluation in 2002.
For this reason, Cristina Fernández may wish to join Argentina financially again to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government reached an agreement with securities holders who had rejected the country's previous re-indebtedness in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to push for an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always rejected a check by the IMF, as elsewhere.
But last month, the Minister for Economic Affairs, Mr Boudou, announced that the Fund will provide "technical support" for the creation of a new national consumer price index, as if this was the first step towards cleaning up the INDEC.
It is unknown whether Fernández will be politically active even without the support of her husband after the end of her term of office.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, the majority of which has enough of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentineans return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy that was shown to her will be severed.
If she wants to win another election, she has to decide whether to silence and quietly lift many of her husband's political decisions.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching a closer link to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of his great brother beyond the sea?
On 27 November more than 7.5 million voters emerged, which are 70% of all voters, in order to vote in the five districts of mayors and city councils. This is appreciated as a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
By establishing groundbreaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma herself is a symbol for the relationship with mainland. His policy has for the first time permanently changed the relationship with China's mother country since 1949.
Ma passed the test, but only barely.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, she did not receive a majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which supports Taiwan's greater independence, received almost 50% of the votes that KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party's voting share has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even joined the city councils with the KMT.
During the election, there came to the usual incidents in Taiwan such as truck convoys with Krawallmachers, flag-sloping mass removals and only poorly dressed dancers.
There was even the mandatory, mysterious attempted murder.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan and Honorary Chairman of the KMT held a speech on a KMT candidate on the eve of the election,
When a man shot him out of the multitude into his face, Lien was wounded, and a standing audience was killed.
Bizarre is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless of this, the attack according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, has affected the election and turned the DPP into a bad light, which the KMT has given more votes.
China may have been the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with mainland were not addressed.
Instead, the candidates debated plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their actual independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to put its relations with the government in Beijing in the foreground.
But this time the DPP also avoided exorcising the anti-Chinese feelings too much.
It responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
On the other hand, Ma wants to confirm that the majority of Taiwanese support its China policy.
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy of withdrawing Taiwan with economic incentives to the Community.
China immediately sent an negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
It certainly wants political integration, but the most important thing first.
It is better to wait until after the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP has now reinvented itself.
Two years ago, she was severely weakened: the former party leader Chen Shui-bian was imprisoned for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he advocated absolute independence.
But under Tais Regentschaft, a new generation of moderate politicians developed and the DPP fought for the votes of the professionals and the youth.
Tsai, as the Presidential candidate of the DPP, found great approval, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Their party now does everything to show that she too is able to establish close relations with Beijing.
Tsai plans to make an idea as a point of contact between the DPP and China, but this presupposes far-reaching discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that her party offered a "trustworthy alternative" to Mas quick approach to China.
Chen seems very upset about these changes.
From his cell he explained that the candidates of the DPP had done better to insist on Taiwan's independence.
He even urged Pragmatic Su to abandon the presidential candidate.
Even without Chen's involvement, the DPP is hard to choose from their potential candidates.
KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Mas values are bad, despite rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to lead their election campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the ever-increasing division between the poor and the rich.
According to a KMT speaker, he will transform his cabinet as well as the local facilities.
The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is only limited in favour of re-approach.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is already no way back."
Grammy nominations: The jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the category Newcomer of the year
If you show up at the request of a president, people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the 2009 Nobel Prize Ceremony Ceremony. Now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer was nominated overwhelmingly for this year's Grammy in the category Newcomer of the year.
In view of the fact that Spalding has already been a celebrated star since her album "Esperanza" in the jazz scene in 2008, the nomination appears a little unusual. However, it complies with the Grammy rules, according to which an artist may have released at least three albums prior to the release of the album with which he was known in the general public.
Your ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with its lively voice and a good sense of pop, funk and Latin music, you can compare Spalding quietly with Norah Jones in 2003, whose great success comes next as a jazz interpreter in this category of nomination Spaldings.
In addition, the album "History" of the Vijay Iyer Trios was nominated in the category Instrumental Albums. This favorite of the critics experienced a huge success.
Iyer's competitors include "Moody 4B" by experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboarder John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a rapacious favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest in HBO's "Treme", was awarded in the category Contemporary Jazz, where other albums from Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber can be found.
The Secret Societ of the Wild Steampunk Musician Darcy James Argue was given some thought in the category of Big Group. He thus opposes the Billy Childs Emsemble with his chamber jazz and adventurous Dave Holland and his octett, whose life-ablum "Pathways" is a good example for a bassist as a democratic bandleader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead the classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award include a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list of Michael Daigherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his symphony no.4 "Los Angeles". This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered in 2009 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
The composer Avner Dorman, based in L.A., was also nominated for his mandolin concert.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classic producers, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckner's Symphony No. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daughterty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" by Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" presented by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Choir.
In the opera category, Mount Lulu of the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse's "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos "L'Amour de Loin" by the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin's "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the orchestra and choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan's "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
As composers, Pärt für Symphonie No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" were nominated for a Grammy.
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was premiered and recorded on January 4 at Disney Hall by the L.A. Philharmonics under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The 30-minute piece is entitled "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Chodorkowski, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolin Concerto" received a nomination in the category Instrumentalsolo with orchestra.
The composer from L.A. said he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for the mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African tones and rhythms," said Dorman in a telephone interview.
The conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category Orchestra performance for a recording of the works of Strawinski with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
As instrumental soloists, pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpinist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated.
As vocal soloists, only women were nominated this year, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Accex and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category Classic-Crossover, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mosque in Temecula gains the approval of the planning committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula found the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee after a five-hour, often heated public hearing.
Critics proposed the project to promote both terrorism and traffic congestion.
However, according to the Commission’s statement of Wednesday evening, the new religious center complies with local regulations and will become an aesthetic eye-catcher.
"The project is supported by many good people - by Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," said Hadi Nael, Chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"As an American, that makes me proud."
"It shows that justice prevails."
"There are only a few opponents," he added.
"They're just very loud."
"Wonderful people live in this valley."
The session began at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the centre lasted almost until midnight, with the votes on both sides being fairly evenly distributed according to Press-Enterprise.
The debate was continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no America anymore," said one comment.
"It is another planet of monkeys, and the Statue of Liberty is dead in the sand."
"America is over."
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, e.g. near Ground Zero, the scene of terrorist attacks on New York City on September 11, 2001.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud called Harmoush for nonviolence.
His community with about 135 families has lived peacefully for years in Riverside County. But they wanted a bigger and better place than the camp they rented together with a water filter plant manufacturer.
The new, approx. 2,300 m2 mosque in Mediterranean style should have two minarettes and be about 13m high.
It is to be built on the approx. 17.500 m2 plot on Nicolas Road near the Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still object to the project at the City Council.
Arsenic-resistant microbes could enable new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign bacteria species that can live on Arsen, among other things, opens up new opportunities for new forms of life on earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on earth, it is in their view a sign that a life is possible even without the elements considered necessary to date.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic."
"This makes it a very special thing, although it is almost a kind of 'foreign' life form," said Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears in the online publication of the journal Science on Thursday.
So far, six main elements have been considered essential - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But as the scientists found out, the bacterium in the California mono Lake is growing even further when it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
"That's when you ask yourself what else is possible," said the co-author of the report Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for alien life, as scientists must recognize life and its forms, according to Anbar.
The study deals with microbes found on earth.
The announcement of a press conference in which no details on the discovery were announced gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could act on the discovery of alien life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that organisms can initiate biochemical processes with the help of other elements in other planetary systems and that the 'standard elements' that we believe are absolutely essential to life are not necessarily specified," explained Charles Cockell, Professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute at the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a novel because it shows that one element can be replaced by another in basic biochemical processes and structures," added Cockell.
This discovery was not random.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from NASA Astrobiological Institute, which conducted the study, chose Mono Lake because of the high arsenic content.
Since arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, they assumed that microbes, both exposed, may be able to replace one element by the other.
"The toxicity of the arsenic is mainly based on the chemical behaviour similar to that of phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from another."
"But the difference is so great that Arsenes act differently than phosphorus. It gets into our biochemical system, where it pretty much lubricates everything," explains Anbar.
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 to an increasing arsenic concentration. It adapted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, it can also survive in arsenic, it shows that an arsenic-based form of life can naturally occur either on earth or on another planet or moon, where arsenic occurs more often.
According to Jamie S. Foster, professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new. But so far there was no working example.
Arsenic was more common in the early Earth years, she says, so science has assumed that early forms of life have used it.
"This gives reason to believe that life may have evolved differently from in the early age of the earth," says Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and National Health.
Other stolen exhibition dogs found in Compton
The other two of the four exhibition dogs stolen from a Bellflower motel were found on Thursday, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, when unknown ones stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van, where the animals were housed in front of a Bellflower Motel at night, according to the authorities' statements.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, explains Steve Whitmore, a spokesman of Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is, the dogs are on the right track," said Whitmore.
"They are in good condition."
"They were returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not give precise details of the location of the dogs nor of the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
"We don't want to say this anymore," explains Whitmore.
"We're tracking a few tracks."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They received their two dogs at a district animal home in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Representatives of the sheriff found the vans and the two dogs in different places in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female, were unharmed, according to the government statement.
However, the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to introduce Rickard and Peek on behalf of their Japanese owners this week on the competition, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were present this weekend for the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach in the city, because Trace should participate in the competition.
As Peek der Times announced on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions on the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show.
South California is a stop on the almost one-month tour of the couple from dog watching to dog watching.
On Monday evening Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They often stay in Motels and park their vans in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxer, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - into their motel room.
The Akitas and Corgis remained in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window wide open, so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen on Tuesday at 6:00 a.m.
Peek promised anyone who could give a hint of the Corgis, a finder's wage. The animals were implanted microchips for identification.
On Thursday it was not yet clear whether a finder's wage will be paid.
After the MGM restructuring has been approved, the lion is revitalised
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got green light for a new start.
On Thursday, a New York bankruptcy judge announced his "preliminary" glimmer plan to clear up the $5 billion debt and pave the way for the 86-year entertainment company to open up the way for new films and television shows.
According to the statement of Thursday, the plan meets the requirements of US bankruptcy law, so that the restart of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, will no longer stand in the way. Barber and Birnbaum will lead the somewhat decommissioned studio as the main manager.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 will actually enter into force only when JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned $500 million loan to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which itself collects $75 million, directs the company. The financing is due to stand by mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the order to help the investment bank Moelis & Co, the management who fought with interest payments of $300 million per year to solve their financial problems.
In August, Managing Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert who was known for his work with Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper's efforts to solve MGM's financial services and to pay for the more than 140 studio's clubs lasted longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided at the end of 2009 to offer the company for purchase.
But the auction attracted only a few bidders and nobody wanted to pay the $2 billion demanded by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything began from the beginning of the MGM team with the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors at the end of October after months of debates and internal disputes.
If MGM has officially survived the bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The Moelis & Co. share that has already received $1.2 million amounts to $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid monthly for the management of the company $375,000, receives a "success bonus" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio produced only one film and produced an annual plan with seven or eight films to come to cinemas in early 2012.
They also plan two films for "Der kleine Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate bond between $265 million and $275 million for its financial contribution to these two films, which are to be created under the direction of Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who financed approximately 18% of the MGM loan, attempted to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, the largest shareholder he is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not lead to any result.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year's favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both players can tear a considerable hole into their gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game is about 10 classic jump ropes or about 48 doses of Play-Doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, in search of three electronic toys under $80, I visited three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore's law had come into force. This year the technology toys are more efficient and cost a little less than last year.
And although less new toys with their own website appear, one of the most famous of these types, Webkind and Club Penguin, is a wider offer.
More and more button cells-powered toys come to the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(If not specified otherwise, all prices of Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years of age) are plush characters, as big as guinea pigs, who sing a note when you press your belly.
Pressing once corresponds to a note, you can play a song by pressing several times.
Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you have started pressing, you can no longer stop.
For a combination of sand and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (fisher price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers interplays like 'Simon says', and thanks to its new hinged foot with wheel-blocking, it dominates the Moon Walk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. However, their parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he's back there (Hasbro/Play School, $40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch of questionnaires that can be a car ride to a class hour, with a better knower with auto correction function as a teacher.
If you don't want to trust your child's smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo from VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games included on it are not as instructive as those on Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which according to Leapfrog's first major revision of the Leapster series is equipped with a new, lighter screen.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
iXL from Fisher Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for the games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Last but not least, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are no larger than a matchbox and have its own LED screen.
The game is about putting the blocks together to speak before the time runs out. It is great for an improvised bookcase competition.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
When you go to the toy shops only after the offer, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online animal in the Club Penguin, for example, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2 Mix 'N Match Figure Package ($5 for children from 6 to 12) containing a coin with a secret code.
When you enter the Code Online, your child will receive enough credits for two more parts in the Club Penguin Store.
These can be rollershoes or a puffy stuffed animal.
The latest head cell-powered microrobot, hexbug nano ($10 for children from 5) is no larger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves quickly to 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through a maze of monasteries.
And he's holding out a lot.
Ours fell from the kitchen table and even survived some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police operations in China are getting softer
Like a training officer Tang Shenbin stepped over a city square, checked his nervous subjects and issued commands with military authority and silenced voice.
He wanted his female members of Chengguan - China's robust guardians of the urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and their slope of violence - to impress the viewers.
"Just stand up!"
"Look straight ahead!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how pretty girls are like that!"
Four girls, hardly growing up in their teens, stood tight with white gloves and identical olive-green jackets and pants.
Four pairs of black pumps stood in straight line.
Four neat hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue and white striped loops.
"For me they look on average," observed Mr. Tang in a small way.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to polish the image of China's city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
Instead of the grey-green, the Guangdong province introduced a brilliant blue uniform.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence by Niederstarren: According to reports in 2009, 50 officials saw an ill-structured snack truck and stared at the operator until he packed in after half an hour and left the place.
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have reinforced the urban police districts. They have been specially selected due to their appearance, their good figure and their youth.
They're supposed to give the brutal police a softer, feminine aspect.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would hardly be able to improve the bad image that the Chinese have of these city councils.
Rightly, so is the critics.
Unlike the police, these officials are only allowed to enforce urban laws by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in the province of Hubei beaten a viewer to death when he filmed them with his cell phone, as they made a protest against a garbage hold.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet, describing how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon dealer suffered from brain injury after a handful of five officials.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows trained officials in China in an attack on street traffickers.
"Chengguan scares the government," Lamented the national newspaper China Daily last year, after further controversy about tactics.
The paper called for a "really thorough cleaning".
Skeptics are clearly insufficient to take this approach.
When the district searched for eight female recruits by display in October, an editorial in Beijing Evening News asked whether women should have real tasks or only serve as optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to a job advertisement, women between the ages of 18 and 22 were sought with a good figure and "harmonic facial features".
They should be above average - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends with reaching the 26th year of life.
According to the officials, the activity of women over 25 is physically too strenuous.
"The most important thing is her image," said an unnamed district official at Rednet.com's quasi-government website.
"Whether the candidates get the job depends first on their external appearance, such as size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes temperament and "inner qualities".
"Female Chengguan are like flower vases," he said and added, "but they have other duties besides."
Ms. Zheng Lihua, Deputy Head of the District City Administration, would not agree to this description,
But admitted that in China size specifications in job advertisements for both sexes are not uncommon.
The same applies to even facial features.
Whether that is likened to good looks is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disorders do not need to apply.
"We can't use lambs or bucklings here," says Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who is patrolized on the Baoguang square near a monastery, 22, has apple cakes and a well-shaped mouth.
She did not feel like a sexist that so great a value is placed on her appearance.
"Find out, I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with ironic eyes.
Your colleague with the dikes, the 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to their information, they do not regret the short attitude, as they would have more ambitious career plans than simply to scare traders through the streets to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning the strip deals with about twelve street dealers who try to sell as many breads and tofu dishes on foot or on bicycle as possible before they are driven off.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We have already told you this so often!" explains Ms. Xu, a dealer who had fled on foot and had temporarily left his noodle kitchen attached to a bicycle cart.
According to the officials, the activity is rather monotonous than strenuous.
"It's almost the same every day," explains Huang Jing, 20, who studies in leisure distribution.
"Everything routine."
One reason is that the female officials are not allowed to confiscate the goods of traders, like their male colleagues.
They can only threaten offenders to report them to their male superiors.
This is intended to protect them from public attacks that officials in China are often exposed to.
This year hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, ransacked after the rumors that Chengguan officials had killed a dealer.
More than a dozen policemen and Chenguan officers were injured in the night, 14 government vehicles were killed or set on fire.
Xindu has been spared from such outbursts of violence.
But unrest is not to be ruled out.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square, where the female officials patrolled this morning, over 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired instead of in a workshop contrary to the rules on the sidewalk.
The owner screamed Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the officials with a nasty face took the road to their vehicles and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a male strip coordinator, remained behind, turning his white nameplate to remain anonymous.
Like her colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we go verbally."
"Sometimes but also physically," explains Mr. Li soberly.

Prosecutor will not sue Senator Ensign
Prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice have acquitted Senator John Ensign of the charges brought against him after his affair with a former electoral assistant and his attempt to give her husband a lobbying activity, the Senator's attorneys announced on Wednesday.
This decision ends the most serious legal charge against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal, which took care of headlines across the country and put a damper on his career, he was considered a possible presidential candidate for the Republicans for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office reported, he was "happy" about the judgment of the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate Ethics Committee could still impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign were terminated and that no further charges were made in this matter.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The verdict was a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. In their opinion, there was sufficient evidence that Ensign has disregarded the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents that were first released in October 2009 in the New York Times gave rise to the suspicion that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his electoral helpers, had turned into lucrative orders to buy his silence over an affair with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton worked as treasurer during an election campaign for Ensigns.
Ensign contacted some political friends to provide Hampton with work. According to the documents and inquiries he took over for her after the attitude of Hampton’s lobbying.
Since Hampton was in Ensign's election team recently, he was not allowed to do lobbying for his former employer or the entire Senate for one year.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the Affaire, violated the so-called ban on turning door lobbying.
According to the published evidence, "it appears to be about an agreement and the violation of the turn-door stats," says Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients who are in the government's vision.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to announce the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other Ethic forces said that the ministry seemed very cautious in taking political charges after a variety of defeats pursued by the media with great interest, including the decision last year to drop the charge against the former Senator Ted Stevens for the misconduct of the prosecutor.
Public prosecutors "are obviously horrific," said Melanie Sloan, president of the Association "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organization whose goal is to combat corruption in the parliamentary and governmental circles of the United States), a group of lawyers who have brought various charges against Mr. Ensign to justice.
"In principle, this means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Chief Defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a phone call from an attorney on Monday and another one the next day when he was told that the ministry would not raise any complaints against his clients.
Mr. Ensign's defender had cooperated with the prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office repeated in a statement on Wednesday, had "acted in accordance with the law".
Mr. Coggins refused to explain more precisely the legal arguments he had presented to the prosecutors.
"I'm not comfortable going into the conversation details between the Ministry of Justice and me. Only so much is said: We believe we have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to terminate the investigations for a separate appeal by the Ethics Group after which a payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons had violated the Federal Electoral Act.
The Electoral Commission said that there was not enough evidence that the money had been anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, which for a long time supported the senator, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton found help from Mr. Ensign Lobbyist work.
An e-mail of December 2008 shows that after the company had continued Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's Chief of Staff, John Lopez, had an interview with Mr. Hampton in which he informed him that he was "closing" at the Ministry of the Interior because of a matter.
Mr. Ensign was also meeting with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, for lunch and asked the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after they had stopped Mr. Hampton for lobbying.
When last year, for the first time, information about this affair came to the public, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had been ranked fourth in the Republican ranks.
After he had not noticed many months ago, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was aiming for a third term in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign is no longer the goal of police investigation, his press spokesperson, Jennifer Cooper, the Senator, hoped that the Ethics Commission would follow the example of the Ministry of Justice very quickly and set up its investigations.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the service of the people of Nevada," she said.
Cheshire's calling on Twitter
Half a dozen of them tipped off in the Krawallen in the courtroom.
In minute time, they sent their reports about cruel testimony on Twitter.
In the end, according to the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process of rape and children chained to beds in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, the carefully followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a Cheshire, Connecticut family, will find an official end when the judge's sentence on the death sentence that the jury has pronounced falls.
But Mr. Hayes' attorneys have already filed applications to court, explain the reasons for an appeal and will employ the courts for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that due to the intensive reporting of the process - including the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - it has come to a "circus atmosphere" and such a widespread, immediate penetration of intrusive details, so that the jury has been unduly affected by public disarmament.
This objection could cause the appeal courts to consider whether the new technologies will require new rules in the courtroom.
"Just as I have experienced it during this process, I believe that it is a real danger if the introduction of new technologies in the courtroom affects the right of each individual to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Haye's chief defender.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Chamber Court, dismissed the applications by decision briefly last week when he said that the new media would be "carefully controlled" and that there would be no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word in this matter.
For decades, court cases have found that reporting on famous-infamous cases raises doubts about the fairness of a process.
In his historic decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States lifted the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland who was supposed to have killed his wife, and said in his decision that because of the new media there would have been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom".
Some believe that the TV series and the feature film "On the Escape" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that court cases, which Mr. Hayes' convictions consider half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the lines of communication from the courtroom that were still unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard Falls.
"There is a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the New Media in processes pursued by a broad public," said John J. Donohue III, Professor at Stanford Law School, who investigated the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, she is randomly hanged.
Professor Donohue said that some appellation courts might be fascinated by the idea that limiting immediate communication from the courtroom could make the processes fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many who present Mr. Hayes' lawyers to discuss for years, thus delaying a conviction.
For example, the defenders also claim that Mr. Hayes could have been prejudiced already when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them cruel crime scene photos during the judicial selection.
Some of the jurors have said that photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and her breeders, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old, had filled them with horror.
The defenders say that they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty Constitution, arguing that the judge wrongly exchanged a jury who had been a critic of the prosecution, and that he would have put undue pressure on the verdict when he had made the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
However, their arguments about the impact of detailed reporting on the process may be of the utmost interest.
In a verdict they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the governor's office and for the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the New Media had continuously rekindled the flames of emotions over the case.
"A day-to-day crowd of media beepers, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "had they not experienced before in New Haven and perhaps even across the country."
Her focus on Twitter reporting is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct news were more intrusive than reports that are being reported more slowly was a technico-optimal view that would weaken reporting on future processes.
However, some lawyers said that appeal courts were often confronted with the argument, social and technical changes needed adaptation by courts.
Mr. Hayer's attorneys reinforce this claim.
In her opposition, she referred to the Supreme Court's decision of 1966, in which the conviction of Dr. Sheppard was lifted on account of the report and made it clear that the New Media required new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy connect the divorceer?
After a campaign of chimpanzees and negativity this week little courtesy broke out in Washington.
Is it the omen of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before returning quickly to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and the summit's summits did not bring any breakthrough in the major issues with which we had to deal during the so-called 'lame duck session', the meeting at the end of a government period in which no more decisions were made.
After all that one hears, it was neither a polite discussion between two different sides nor a observance of their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a party score.
The President's public meeting on Wednesday was also civilised, despite the political differences that continue to exist between the members.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months creates a mutual respect that conceals the ideological divide that continues to separate members.
That is hardly enough to claim that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one of the other signs of cooperation and willingness to compromise demands, while one tries to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters after a new party warfare.
Therefore, the meeting itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of claims or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and Republicans are too big and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it's about taxes, donations, health or expectations, both sides are miles away from each other.
Last but not least, Washington's November election has voted mildly for a short time.
"No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration, who now works for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center".
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections arouse partial passions that die again.
And that's good."
In some questions, especially those on the agenda of the "Lame Duck Session", Republicans and Democrats hardly have a choice but to find a solution."
Bush's tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one supports that.
Both sides want to find a way to obtain some or even all, whether temporary or permanent.
Similarly, a compromise on increased unemployment benefits is to be expected, even if only because Republicans cannot afford to believe that the favored tax cuts for the rich, while refusing to provide support to unemployed workers.
After the Tuesday meeting in the White House, optimism has increased that one can agree on these questions during the "lame duck session" and at the same time ratify the New START contract.
However, William Glaston of the Brooking Insituation warns that successful cooperation on urgent questions of the lame Duck session" does not necessarily lead to lasting cooperation between the parties when the new 112th Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of non-conformity is more likely, perhaps even indispensable.
"After the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this scepticism is shared by many - the courtesy leads to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of what's happening from today to 2012, as a pretext, or shadow boxes, for the 2012 main event," he said.
The reasons for this have much to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party whales which were useful for their formation.
As concerned the Republican leaders may be that they are too high poker, they know that they must try to keep their promises to reduce government spending and put health reform out of control.
These party lines are already apparent in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the Commission on the deficit, which include tax reform and the raising of some taxes, the raising of the retirement age and the reduction of government expenditure.
Vice-Chairmen Alan Simpson and Erstine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, in their own opinion, have insisted so much on putting the deficit question on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 out of 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan official and they fight very hard to get even close to this figure.
The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the panel, since in financial questions, at least today, there is little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston predicts two phases in the struggle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first battle will take place next year in the form of party clashes when Republican Obama challenges the state budget, the taxes and the health system, later followed by a phase of greater two-party cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
Public opinion.
It is proven that, despite the partyality of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as it has happened in 1995, both parties must pay close attention to the public response.
Anyone who is convicted of losing will have to change the course and seek the compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Partyality and polarization are now greater than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Congress-Republicans than at the time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a far wider choice of consequence in 2012.
So seen this week's courtesy may be welcomed by many Americans.
But on both sides, much more effort will be required to find a common denominator on the issues that the two still separate.
The leaked US document portrays Moscow as a port of corruption
The control of the city lies in the hands of the "Kleptocracy" and it passes on to the Kremlin part of the bribery and the protective allowance it collects. Thus, in February, the American Embassy reported in a memo in Russia.
Both the police and the state security services are extorting high levels of protection so that they can maintain their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it is said.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal gangs.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called "vertical authority" - takes its part of the money that the leaders migrate up.
The memo sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle was published on his homepage by WikiLeaks on Tuesday.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is hardly any evidence that in the meantime had been cleaned up.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected accusations of corruption over years, and he has won numerous slanders against such accusations.
In September, he told a Russian TV station when he was asked for a documentation suggesting he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. That has given rise to polls.
But it is unusual that, as happened in the Ambassador's report, individuals are called, and it is not heard that this is happening through a diplomat from a foreign country.
"The direct link between the Moscow Government and crime has led some to call it "disturbed" and to conclude that the government acts more like a cleptocrat than a government," says the memo.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a term from the world of criminals / the Mafia, which literally means "roof" or protection), which extends over the police, the state security (FSB), the ministry (MVD) and the office of the prosecutor as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Specialists have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second level."
"Recently, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors follow at the bottom of the line."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups in some areas close a gap because the city does not offer any help."
The report goes on to say that FSB funds are collected from the largest companies and that the police arrests small businessmen.
A source, that is said, "explained that Moscow's business owner understands that it is best to get protection from MVD and FSB (and not from organized crime), because they have not only more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, protection by criminal gangs is no longer as requested as before."
The memo notes that while the collection of funds is comprehensive, the protection itself very modest are none; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business very quickly closed before - due to one or another pretext.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time has noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men who go to the Kremlin with suitcases that were probably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow commission of experts, recently in an interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class because a political class in Russia no longer exists."
Without politicians, without opposition, without separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
By the way, nationwide corruption is estimated to cost Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranked at rank 154 a recent investigation into the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organisation Transparency International (the least corrupt countries are listed as "the most corrupt").
The release of the memo of the American Embassy, which happened late in the evening after Moscow, will certainly trigger failures within the Russian government, although, as Lushkov can be accused of the mistakes of Moscow, it can also be an opportunity for the Kremlin to claim that one can solve the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that WikiLeaks documents could be a forgery and responded angryly to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it is about our interaction, which is an important factor of domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't expect this to happen with such an arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past
In a poorly illuminated, concreted classroom with dirty and peeling walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built it of the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everybody here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Because of his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the butcher", the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed the infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrender to the government, long-standing supporters are challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed the victims to face public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school book that for the first time tells children of former soldiers the history of Khmer Rouge.
And in July, for the first time, a former member of Khmer Rouge was sentenced to the former head of the notorious Tuol Slang Torture Chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, fear grew among Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, making their efforts to reconcile and reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There's still some rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of Cambodia's documentation center, an independent organization that explores the regime.
"For her life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It divides families itself."
During Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of disease, revision, or hunger.
When the Vietnamese invaded and the Pol Pot-Ied government crashed in 1979, the regime's remnants and its military fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
Here they spread unrest until December 1998, when the last movement surrendered.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungle of Cambodia, Ta Mok moved to the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-funded peace agreement led to the first democratic elections of the country in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to move to government, leading to the capitulations of Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998 of a natural death, and Ta Mok, who had not surrendered, was arrested by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in 2006 in Phnom Penh prison, where he was waiting for his trial.
When their patrons no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled to the murky poverty of the rural Cambodian and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even though a few of the Khmer Rouge's elite officials kept their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
"These people have benefited very little from the surrender," said Sok Leang from the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, also in Anlong Veng
"They are anchored in the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
So Lim, 55 years old, who had joined the Rhmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle for Veng before settling in 1998 to lead a life as a poor rice farmer.
"The life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok gave everyone something to eat."
"But now life is difficult because we have to take care of ourselves."
The Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife and Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to court.
The court's mission is to condemn the old leaders and those who are primarily responsible for the crimes, but it is not said whether it will pursue further acts beyond these four cases.
This has contributed little to alleviating the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculations have concentrated on In Chaem, 64 years old, who had been the district chief in the province of Manteay Meanchey during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007 she told the documentary center of Cambodia that she had led the construction of the Trapeang thma damm, a project in which thousands of forced workers probably died.
In a hot evening, in Chaem from work on the fields to her wooden house on a dirty road outside Anlong Veng came back.
When the sun cast shadows on the weary grass, Chaem refused to discuss her past with Khmer Rouge.
If the court invited her, she would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there were no more persecutions, there would be war here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would be unsafe, the court would accuse more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do in order to move forward, said Chhang Youk from the documentation center.
"Reconciliation with Khmer times means collapsing the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put together these broken parts so that we can understand as everything."
The Centre created the first school book on Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia", approved by the government.
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to the history book for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on Khmer Rouge.
As often in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the connections of the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents responded skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people are convicted by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the school book and the court are gradually gaining influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
Up in the Dangrek mountains, an overgrown and covered with plastic waste leads to a rectangle of black red, covered with a rusty sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body had been burned here after his death in 1998 on a pile of tires.
Nowom Sothea, 31 years old, a cell phone salesman on the roadside, said she didn't know much about the man who had been burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people go to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later in the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last resting place, where she will lay down a bush of mature bananas - hoping to bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees not to further accumulate capable uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material worldwide, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that uranium will no longer be collected, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with Belarus's Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
For years the U.S. government had tried to convince Belarus not to collect highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a hurdle last spring.
But official of the US government told Washington Post that in the past two months two secret agreements with Belarus have been concluded to remove 187 pounds of weapons-rich uranium from a Belarusian research institute.
This prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, about 500 pounds.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama's "Nuclear Security Summit of the 47 Nations" of April, which the Belarus had ruled out.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited about the fact that they want a seat in the nuclear safety summit (2012)."
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's nuclear safety summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How to keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is basically weapons capable, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said back then.
"This is our raw material... We're not going to make dirty bombs out of it and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago when it showed interest in meeting an agreement.
The first attempt to remove the Uranium Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was slightly irradiated, say official.
It was loaded into a special train, for which more than 1,300 miles to become a Russian warehouse and disposal factory, say official.
The second attempt was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane according to the official.
The US government pays for these efforts $14 million, with most of the money flowing into Belarusian research with poorly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was extremely carefully coordinated and coordinated in order to build trust", which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Ministry of Energy working on global risk reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Proliferation Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-free uranium this year and hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus intends to dissolve its camp by 2012 under the common agreement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States were tense for years, primarily because of Lukashenko's harsh disregard for human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests a possible rapprochement.
"Welcomed to the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a key issue in improving bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she explains.
No objections by the Spanish Government to CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objections to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al-Qaeda prisoners over the Spanish territory to Guantánamo, as indicated by a telegram of the U.S. ambassador in Madrid.
This reflects the documents presented by Wikileaks and forwarded to the daily newspaper "El País" (via cable). It is added that the former deputy head of government María Teresa Fernández de la Vega called for the Spanish government to be informed "to demonstrate that foreign aircraft flying over Spain are adequately monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe in which aid for human rights abuses in a dozen countries, including Spain, was charged, the former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega spoke.
The Deputy Head of Government admitted that the Council's report "has "received Zapatero" and confirmed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega pointed out that Spain had no objections to the secret service flights over Spanish territory."
"You just want to be informed," not to be "unpreparedly surprised," Aguirre reports via cable.
The former Foreign Minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government "does not want to pay much attention to this matter, although the government has little influence as these were in the hands of the judges."
Public Prosecutor Vicente González, in January 2007, gave the message to understand that he would not seek the judicial initiative to block the declassification of the documents of the Spanish Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Minister of Defence on the CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any troubling or sensitive information," said the ambassador after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about the "appearable coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to operate discreetly between governments," Aguirre laments.
At a lunch in March 2007, in which the Ambassador of the United States and the Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba attended, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges were madly concerned about their independence and did what they thought was appropriate," he had given instructions to his employees to avoid "blowing up rhetorical comments in order to let the tension fade away."
The Ambassador also expressed concern about the PP's approach to this matter.
"Despite its generally pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt it, from a point of view that the government of Zapatero, which could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, will have tolerated or deliberately ignored capital, even if these revelations could have a negative impact on the government of the United States," he points out.
The child murderer admits that she complained about the "difficult" of motherhood on the Internet.
The young woman spoke of the child when this was already dead and she had a blog: "Terrorism in a Galician way"
Mondica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki".
Under this nickname, which she records from a small age, she keeps in touch with a cousin and at least a friend. Both come from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The communications date from 2008.
To understand this, one must know her love life that reconstructs the daily ABC based on testimony of her family members.
In 1998, the 30-year-old Galician woman entered into a relationship with Iván Tuuñez, an industrial woman.
She was a year old.
Shortly after she had dissolved her relationship, it became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was from him, but his ex-husband never let him carry out a DNA analysis.
Shortly thereafter, she entered into a different relationship.
The choice was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring congregation.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to take care of herself in the labour market, the little girl stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the contents of their messages it can be concluded that their love relationship broke down and they separated.
In March 2008, she is alone on Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very peculiar and angry because I came here to work."
"When I told him that, he found it good, but now he realizes, of course, what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not to be free to do and let what he wants."
Later she mentions a message she just received on her phone: "I want you to come back to me this month or send me an address to which I can send you the boy."
She complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving the boy with my mother, I'll pick him up when I'm back."
In May she talks about returning to her village: "This week I'm going to go there, but I'm only going to stay there until the 19th because I have to introduce myself to work on the 20th if I don't want to lose it."
She says she'll take her firstborn when things go well.
"He will be with him, that is, with me. Never in life will I leave him with anyone except my mother," a questionable intention when you consider their bad relationship.
In July there is another mail.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th day is dead.
"On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other hand, not satisfied."
"On the one hand he is with me and the place likes him a little bit, but on the other hand he has to go to school every day."
She's talking about a move to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will attend a summer course, so I have less spending on the nanny."
On 17th: Memories and complaints.
"A giant kiss of César asking me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on e-mail. You see, if he wants to, he'll find me, so shit."
On the 30th, one more: "The boy is doing well. He is going to a summer course to learn Catalan."
Víctor, her current partner, has one: "He's shooting money at me."
On the Internet, in anime and mangablogs, there are messages from it.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now locked up, and in which she called herself "Muki, the jailer".
"Terror a la mad (Heading) ".
The last man who lived with her, a sworn hunting officer, explains to have a conscience because he feels guilty.
He can't believe that everything happened because she hadn't told him that she was a single mother.
Monica was transferred to Palma Province Prison yesterday by the Center for Prisoners at Menorca.
The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, said she could not remember the course of the case, "and she had no intention of doing the minor harm."
Before that, however, she had confessed to drowning César in the bathtub and storing his body in a suitcase.
Defence and Public Prosecutor's Office applied for a psychiatric opinion.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in the congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of November 28, the PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in the number of votes and Members in the last regional elections, the PP is already focusing on the parliamentary elections - preferring or not. Their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes this party achieves in these elections is usually twice as high as in the elections in Catalonia.
For example, the Catalan People's Party received 610.473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this figure was only 316.222 in the 2006 regional elections.
On the last Sunday, the PPC scored 384,091 votes.
If this rising trend - the result of the shift of the PSC's voting share and the tying of the PP's electoral power - were to stop, PP's analysts predict that the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 Congress members, while CIU four (now 10) would win and the PSC would lose at least 9 members (of 25).
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose a member - at present it has three - while ICV would hold its Member or gain one.
However, if the electoral calendar is to be maintained, the next date will be the municipal elections in May 2011. Even then, the People's Party (PP) can be the tongue on the scales to put an end to socialist domination, in four provincial capitals and by its majority in the Barcelona City Council, one of the largest households: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the Nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will be able to lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists neither reach a majority nor use their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican Debacle, it is not wrong for this party to lose its representation in the Barcelona City Council, in which it would have to win 5% of the votes.
The PP, on the other hand, recorded an increase in its voting share in the four provincial capitals and could become a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced to be able to play the leading role in Tarragona's turn. There they had ruled with PP before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
En Lérida is the PP only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Uncle Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election they met several times.
In other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels, or Reus, the People's Party was also able to grow significantly.
The PP is currently represented in 34 Catalonia's urban authorities and aims to create lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell brought Al Qaida thousands of travel passes
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand.
The seven police officers of the Barcelona Police Department and the Nigerians formed the jihadist cell controlled by Thailand, the different Al Qaida groups, including the "Move to Liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter was author of the attack in Bombay, which claimed 106 deaths - supplied passports.
The Spanish Minister of the Interior attaches great importance to these investigations, which goes so far that he assures that with the "Operation Kampai" the counterfeiting machine of Al Qaida has been "weakened" worldwide and "somit their ability to act".
The researchers assume that in the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they falsified and then sent to the groups from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaida was composed, so that their "combatants" could without penalty cross the borders of European and other Western countries.
The detected cell is not the only one of the jihadist network active in Europe. That is why other European police units have also participated in the investigations, except the Thai investigative bodies. It cannot be ruled out that there will be similar attacks in the EU in the next few days, such as those carried out in Barcelona last Tuesday.
In coordination with this operation (Pakistan Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiad were arrested), another one was carried out in Thailand, where Pakistan's Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai countries were arrested.
They had led from Bangkok from the cell settled in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - a part of it had been destroyed in 2009 - particularly stole tourist passports according to the requirements of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents were issued on the names of men aged 25 to 45 and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to show a visa stamp.
In investigation circles, it is underlined that until now no links could be established between the prisoners in Catalonia and the assassination in Bombay, although the author of this assassination was "Laschkar e-Taiba", one of the recipient groups of the passports stolen in Spain and subsequently forged in Thailand.
However, it should be recalled that a few days before the assassination of Catalonia by means of a money transfer company, several thousand dollars had been sent, which were "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "command", who put an end to the life of 106 people.
The police confiscated extensive documentation.
PP calls on Mas to postpone the tax agreement
The president of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to personally present his conditions to support his appointment as Prime Minister of the Generalitat. These are not different from those already put forward during the election campaign and can be summarized with the priority of economic recovery and the absence of regionalist independence adventures, such as a financial compensation agreement which the regionalist leader proposes at the height of his mandate.
The chairman of the Catalan People's Party addressed Artur Mas, who gave her the 18 Members who won her last Sunday, with a number that is more than sufficient to make himself felt indispensable, because the candidate of the CiU bourgeois-regionalist party insists that at least one of the opposition parties is present in the vote on his entry into office.
The future alliances that regionalists want to join in the forthcoming parliamentary elections in Congress depend on a possible duck with the PP. However, the talks that Mas is currently conducting with the other party leaders revolve around Catalonia.
With regard to the PPC President, it calls for "all discourses relating to the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" and for an agreement on the balance between the State and the Autonomous Region - similar to that in the Basque Country - and which the CIU's Head of Party wants to submit to a referendum.
Both political leaders tend to make the structured political apparatus of the regional administration slimmer and to abolish inheritance and gift tax.
The details of the negotiations on the accession of Mas deal with the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a hard opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The old nursing home confirms that the deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the Altenheim in Olot do not rule out that their caretaker killed over 11 elderly people
The leaders of the old nursing home La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) yesterday gave a press conference in which they pointed out the damage to the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmés - the caretaker who had killed at least eleven old people for whom he was responsible - to the institution during his work.
The head of the old nursing home, Joan Sala, joined his lawyer, Joan Cañada, in court and announced that "La Caritat wants to sue the person responsible (for the deaths), but "the law and our liability force us to accept the trial and civil liability".
The institution must not only take a social loss because it had not determined the criminal acts of the caregiver in due time, but now also pay a high amount of compensation, calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he has been murdering ever since.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the old nursing home - as he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but the formalities due to their age and diseases were handled by telephone.
The head of La Caritat denied this point round the road and said that "a lack of action could not have been the reason for the incidents."
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there would be no evidence in the lawsuit of negligent acts of a person other than the accused."
The man who had been baptized as "Death Angel" stood before yesterday at eleven murders and declared that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 and killed the second old lady one and a half months later.
In this case, he killed insulin with an overdose, unlike the first one in which he had given a mixture of different tranquilizers.
The head of La Caritat said that access to the drugs was difficult to control.
The insulin syringes and the tranquilizer cocktail were used by the caregiver in six out of nine crimes committed to relieve patients with death from their suffering.
But the results of the laboratory investigations will reveal whether Vila is lying and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims or whether he burned them out from the inside by handing them bleach, as he confessed to three women who he killed between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat, there is no belief in the statements of the caregiver, not even in the number of murders confessed, which could be quite more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it does not make sense to change his approach suddenly after eight successful murders.
They say they made themselves available for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents by the judiciary.
Threats of the European Central Bank (ECB)
The investors responded sharply yesterday to the threat of the ECB President Trichet, who warned, "markets should not underestimate our reaction."
The risk-absorptions of the euro-peripheral countries have increased dramatically and the shares of European banks have increased by more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB may be deceived and that the euro has not raised issues of concern.
The events of yesterday are typical of an illiquid market which, to the extent that it collapses, recovers, but due to the closure of short and high speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear for a long time.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to reverse our liquidity measures, according to which the ECB will have to withdraw for the fourth time in two years tomorrow, and probably several times in the future.
The Bundesbank called for the termination of the plan to purchase sovereign debt, as these were ineffective, as well as for the lifting of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures. It was only to maintain a one-week, unlimited access.
According to the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "by March at least" and quarterly invitations to tender with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to guarantee liquidity until at least June.
We also expect the programme to continue to buy bonds and produce a strengthening signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent reaction of the markets is thrown back yesterday and if we insist that we take back our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Just as at the ECB meeting in May, where the Bank reaffirmed not to consider the purchase of sovereign debt and then collapse the markets, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and durable.
In May she showed her teeth, and on Wednesday she said she had already bought a lot of things, causing a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one year’s state titles in Portugal was rather weak.
Government asset management spent only 500 million at 5.28%, compared with 750 million at 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, Portugal's interest rates fell by 30 basis points throughout the curve, reflecting a change in market perception according to the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, allied and Bank of Ireland’s debt hole figures were published.
The sum is estimated at about 10 000 million in the short term and possibly another 15 000 in the short term.
Although Ireland has lost its credibility completely after it failed to recognise the problem of the stress tests in July, the figures under the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, the government will have to receive Parliament's approval of its new budget next Tuesday, and as it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel designed her discourse with regard to the Heads of State and Government summits on 14 December. There, political unity is needed to show that we are playing the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the ninth Beethoven Symphony.
The Spanish Prime Minister yesterday presented the action plan to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Retirement reform, transparency in autonomous regions such as financial institutions, government deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures. Measures sounding in investors' ears such as Vivaldis Four Seasons of the Year.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange has increased by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish central bank was fast and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today, there is a significant auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, and that is why we are relying on a strong demand that will eliminate all doubts about our re-indebtedness.
For Spain, the request for an aid plan would be a sacrifice of its own.
We would have liquidity that we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March, the interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would be closed without delay.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be in line with the motto of Caesar's wife: "Now not only does being count, but also appearance."
Only courage, we can do that!
At the request of his children, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Eulen fights the Meeting of Shareholders of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the Álvarez family, owners of the Eulen and El Enebro companies, does not run away.
David Álvarez, founder of the corporate garrison, will challenge El Enebro's shareholders' meeting, which will take place on 16th day at the request of five of his seven children, as he considers them "absolutely void". His children will try to obtain a majority in order to control the administrative bodies of the company - owner of the winery Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his children Jesus David and María José are preparing the legal measures for a new Judicial Chapter in their dispute for the control of a part of the Group.
The founder of the largest holding company for business services does not seem to be prepared to give up the control of the organs of El Enebro in his litigation.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, appointed as members of the Board of Directors at the Shareholders' Meeting of 18 January of this year, which has already been registered in the Commercial Register.
The shareholders' meeting of El Enebro, which was convened for the 16th time by the Judge of the Court of Commerce, No. 2 of Madrid, has triggered a new thunderstorm in the family of Álvarez.
The judge's call to convene the assembly is the only legal way to ensure the convening of the shareholders' meeting.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz will be designed by David Álvarez as a "desperate means of applicants - his five children - to allow, by means of legal delinquency, fraudulent practices and legal abuse, the defamation of the meeting of 18 January", as official speakers state.
This argument is the basis for challenge to the Assembly in retrospect in order to declare it "absolutely void".
The same protagonists who hide themselves in discreet silence tried unsuccessfully in June to convene a meeting on a judicial basis.
With El Enebro - asset company and owners of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, alongside other assets - David Álvarez's seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, according to family records, the founder of the service group calls for the right to use more than 51% of capital.
This is the actual background of the case on which the judge has to decide in the hearing on the handling of the appeal for which no date has yet been fixed.
Red Bull wins in the F1 with a secret weapon by Siemens
The cars are improved with a software in real time.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1, its history in this exquisite universe has been marked by the speed of surprises and successes.
At the beginning, no one paid attention to the newcomer and despite his steep rise during the last season, everyone sat on the tarmac of Fernando Alonso's Ferrari last November.
Without wanting to reduce the capabilities of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of the Renault engine, the "secret weapon" that the Multi Siemens Red Bull put in the hands, and thus created a winning team, has become a legend.
In reality, this is a powerful software for the simulation of processes that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes that are not related to car racing.
This software program, known as PLM, was used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, energy plants and high-precision instruments.
A true reproduction or simulation of a product or process is intended before it is actually built in order to avoid faults and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft and Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the Siemens industry department, explains that using this software in Formula 1 factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time" can design and perform the changes and improvements that can be found on the race and during the tests.
Russwurm explains that in 1992 there were an average of ten technicians working in the racing stations, which in one season could bring no more than three or four improvements.
Today, 180 highly qualified young people are employed in the Red Bulls team. With high-performance computer systems, they perform analyses and all possible changes to the racing cars.
The Siemens manager explained that the PLM software was able to analyze and improve all components of the Red Bull racing cars, with the exception of the engine for which Renault alone is responsible.
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the safety elements are being changed.
The changes can be transferred to reality thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves within less than 24 hours from the virtual reality of the simulator.
The only limit set by this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million that a Formula 1 team is allowed to spend in a season for its race.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its racing cars in a 50-kilometre location in London.
These are two buildings in which visits - especially by journalists - are strongly restricted.
Everything that happens there is Top Secret.
The workforce includes 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bulls true Formula 1 - Hero is undoubtedly the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy-drinking manufacturer places in the services of his participation on the racing routes are other protagonists, whose support is invaluable and their awareness is equal to zero.
The plant's technologist, Steve Nevey, stressed that five years ago, it could be said that the progress in the field of R & D for racing cars contributed 50 percent to the victory and that the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today the share values have changed. Technology accounts for 85 percent of the success, while pilots’ contribution is estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by EDV, because they are "unforeseeable gladiators".
HP will open twenty own stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) invited his first exclusive shop in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes yesterday in Barcelona.
It is the first of a 20-store sales network with 80 to 100 square metres each, which the Multi intends to open in Spain over the next two years.
The company agrees this initiative with the existing 16 sales areas in multi-brand operations, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The deputy chairman of HP España, Helena Herrero, mentioned the rebuilt shop at Gran Vía in Barcelona, the property of Pont Reyes, with which HP has worked for thirty years.
The North American Group intends to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010, including 20 branches in Spain.
The first were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Mr. Herrera did not want to betray the upcoming reopenings, but did not rule out that Madrid could be the next target.
The vice-president, who is also head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy of shop opening is always the same. She is based on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group advises them and takes over the exclusive shop equipment (with interactive products to touch).
HP is also responsible for the training of shop staff.
Helena Herrero said that it was not a franchise system and pointed out that the exclusive sales point network was intended to "optimize the customer service and advice of small and micro-enterprises during the purchase and after, even the packaging."
The shop in Barcelona has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service connects to the Maastricht Technical Centre (Holland).
"This way we can solve problems in ten minutes, which sometimes take up to two days."
"This system was developed especially for small and micro enterprises and private customers, because large companies already have their service contracts for technical customer service," said Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants his rival to 'stolen' a million customers in three years
The managing director of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and prophesies the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, it foresees a fall in interest rates which banks are trying to compensate for with increases in fees and prices for loans.
Sabadell expects to catch one million private customers in three years - an still existing subject.
Sabadell has found the way to survive the next three years in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year guidance plan in 2011.
The goal is not only to survive without using public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share by one million private customers - 700 000 if you cut off the customers who will lose the bank - which is the big challenge facing this bank, because so far it has paid more attention to its business customers than its private customers.
This year, it has attracted 250 000 private customers and 50 000 businesses.
Their market share for private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers represent more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is to increase productivity, say austerity, cost reduction. The challenges faced by the bank will be presented together with the annual financial statements.
Few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has upset all banks' plans worldwide.
This year Sabadell will conclude its four-year guidance plan Optima, which was initially designed for three years, but as a result of the market situation, it was extended by one financial year.
The customers that will leave the savings banks are the bank's main goal.
At a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola emphasized, 2011 would be a "hard" year "with great reach".
The manager assumes that Spain would only be "slow" out of the crisis.
In addition, it would be "very difficult" to create "work" in two or three years - fundamental to the bank's survival.
Even if he assumes that the war on liabilities - which penalises the interest margins - will wane, the risk premium that banks and savings banks will have to pay for their emissions to maintain liquidity will be reduced as compensation for falling profit margins already falls to the price of loans.
"The issues of liquidity and financing are structural in nature and they will exert pressure on the loans."
"We didn't turn the cock off, but the interest differentials are very high," admitted Guardiola.
Banesto already issued the arrangement to its branch network on Thursday, limiting the granting of long-term loans and increasing the interest rate differentials (cf. Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also agreed that the banks were currently pursuing stategy to "increase fees", but "within a framework marked by competition".
Sabadell's guideline is based on organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporate business.
Not for nothing, he assures us that "larger companies are necessary in Spain."
"In the coming year everything will change," he assures.
He emphasises that the demand for capital is currently "equal" and does not rule out that some Spanish financial institutions are going to slip into red numbers.
He believes that the FROB could replace the money market in the event of captitulation.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive a temporary closing of markets, he reinforces the argument of some bankers who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He stressed that nothing could be put into circulation, but unlike the events in June, short-term financing could be obtained through repo shops, thereby cutting off the crisis.
CECA excludes a second fusion wave of savings banks
The Director-General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a fusion wave of savings banks and stressed the speed with which the industry was restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks did not have to participate in the first phase. They held the second round.
On the other hand, the Director-General of the Spanish savings bank association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the group of Banca Cívica cannot be considered a second round, but they were adjustments."
"Most of it is complete. It may be that we have thirteen or fourteen instead of seven times, but all important processes have already been completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, who has strongly supported all processes."
At a breakfast organised by the Association of Managing Directors and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the concentration process "was carried out as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timely course, which was set in earlier times, not now, within the framework of the business plans with Banco de España," he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28 000 million assets to 17 with 75 500 million per year is a historically incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, with which we have fulfilled the Basel agreement," he stressed.
Olavarrieta said, "There were a number of unobtrusive opinions about the slowness of the process, the unstintingness and insensibility," because "Banco de España urges us to close in time before the end of the year."
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain had one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and "maybe" in the whole world, and added that those who did so "without any deeper knowledge" were doing so.
The manager noted that in the current economic situation, we need to "no worries" about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, which have undergone a "very important" concentration process, which will be carried out "as soon as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had passed the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has opted for the maintenance of the euro, but at the same time has set conditions for the entire European Union.
Tensions in the markets have triggered a twofold response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has presented new adjustment measures, starting with tax reductions for small and micro-enterprises, the regulation of temporary workers, or the lifting of EUR 426 support for unemployed persons who do not receive unemployment benefits, up to the privatisation of 49 percent of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, the Deputy Head of Government, Elena Salgado, with the help of former Prime Minister Felipe González, supports the criticism of the Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible for the current crisis.
How are these processes to be understood?
It was anticipated that Merkel's position is not a fault of her public relations work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
In doing so, Germany takes a fundamentally new perspective on the design of our future, which conflicts with the maintenance of the old-fashioned traditions of a large part of its partner.
In view of the resistance in Europe, one starts to speculate about three possible ways out of the crisis in Germany.
The first: A strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the euro area.
The second: The reintroduction of the German Mark - although it currently sounds more like Science Fiction - is supported by a large part of the public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third: a reform of the euro according to German proposals. That means: more macro-economic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of countries that comply with the requirements; possibly the cancellation of some countries and the extension of the cost of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been distinguished for some time now. Therefore, there are no excuses now.
First 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government withdrew from its sleeve a constitutional reform to prevent this from happening in 2016.
This was the first sign of the break-up between what Germany considered necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign put the Central European country, as Merkel the decision to save Greece painfully.
This was strongly criticised at the time, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public opinion and the published opinion were absolutely against a rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last few days of October, Merkel has again come out with a clear position, calling for a reform of the European Union's agreements to enable the rescue of a country and at the same time for the private lenders to bear some of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, since it pushed forward the Irish crisis and everything else.
But her proposal, albeit somewhat sweet, has been adopted, and over the next few months we will be taking part in the reform of the European Union, which will allow for these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not intend to exceed it.
It all says that - even if unpopular measures need to be taken now - there will be no longer the old functioning of the euro as of this date.
In 2013, the year of birth will be a new currency area in which the countries in breach will be severely penalised, will be forced to declare themselves incapacitated and, in this case, the private sector will have to bear part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we need to take a hard growth rate, with high savings and investment rates, consumption measurement, improved productivity and competitiveness, and positive external balances.
The other alternative, based on indebtedness and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as mentioned by Spain in boom times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we wouldn't understand.
It is not just about reducing the government deficit to three percent by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to cheat on ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence goes into more calm.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities that will be offered to us by spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero understood this as well, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the major companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) points out that despite the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis of creating order in her own house has prepared her way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn't look like anything would change.
Among the possibilities considered is that we would not have to leave the euro area filled with few serious countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sports and regulation
Tricks such as those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will to circumvent a penalty.
The fact that two players of the Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) allegedly made an exclusion in the November 23 game against the Ajax in the Champions League led to a lot of ink being shed on whether or not it was an unportraitable act and whether or not both players should be sanctioned by the UEFA.
As is well known, the two players lost a few minutes before players (their team had already clearly won) time and played several fouls so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid would lead its group, the two players will fulfil the penalty prescribed at the next league game against the Auxerre and thus enter the next game phase without cards.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished the coach of the club, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice; it is more often found in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten but followed rules in this sport.
Part of the debate about the presented case is due to the fact that a team of the real Madrid football club (who presented nobleness and honor in his hymn and had punished his players for similar incidents) played the leading role in this, and to the dramatisation by Mourinho, who added an episode more to his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this practice, which is not expressly prohibited by the statutes, contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. whether these actions constitute a regulatory environment. In fact, this approach is consistent with the statutes of sport, but seems to be circumventing its meaning.
In this case, the damage caused by the sports spirit should be investigated.
The sports spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not threatened by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that the opposing players take unfair advantage of the counter-team. Also that did not happen.
The paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we normally understand by misplay or rule, because the circumvention of the rule has not been carried out secretly to avoid a penalty, but it should be as conspicuous as possible so that it is punished by the arbitrator.
The players waited and gladly accepted the penalty.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders drew from the intentional fouls.
It should be stressed here that the rival was neither brought into a more unfavourable situation nor gained benefits for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to play with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club then does not have these players.
The advantage obviously is that the players start the next game phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it’s a long-term advantage, up to a certain degree unknown, as the team could eventually also leave. In addition, the players receive a penalty with this procedure and move into the second card cycle in which they leave with a card less than in the first cycle due to card accumulation.
This is not so clear whether it really is an advantage.
Finally, such practices are not directed against the spirit of sport, which also includes strategic decisions, in order to derive maximum benefit from the rules.
In this case the players did not want to bypass the penalty (it would actually be a clear case of rule circumvention), they wanted to choose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding a penalty or fleeing from it.
Although the boundary between invention and regulatory environment is blurred, I believe that this matter is a clear case of invention.
I have the impression that the polemics were created as a result of two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the nature of the provoked rule transfer.
The damage caused by these actions to the principles of sport is less ethical than rather aesthetic.
Offers open to customers for group Christmas dinner in Barcelona
This year, the journal of the calendar drops an avalanche of reservations to the days of 16 and 17 December.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves are spreading. They don’t want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, there is also a group dinner in the pre-Christmas period, which brings oxygen to the restaurant and leisure industry in Barcelona. However, as a result of the economic crisis, they provide a price offensive to capture the customer segment, which represents the great mass: Almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, the questioned entrepreneurs and associations confirm.
To make accounting even more complicated, the calendar (Silvester falls on a Friday) has dropped all orders into the week of December 13, with the result of a avalanche of reservations of dinners to two top players (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when bad times began, many companies have set aside group dinners for household reasons.
In order not to have to renounce this tradition, many employees pay them out of their own pocket.
As the economic situation always holds, the lowest prices are required, confirmed by the chairman of the Barcelona restaurant estate, Gaietà Farràs.
So far, the representative of the Ochverband does not dare to predict what the holidays will be like this month.
"People think about it ten times before they reserve."
"They like to go out, but they pay close attention to the prices," he emphasizes.
The business will go well for those who "offer the quality at good prices with a good service", he adds, and calls us to remember that customers are saving in times of crisis, which is why prices are most requested by 25 euros.
In a survey in various centrally located restaurants it turns out that the evening of December 17th leads the suppliers to collapse.
The Soteras Group says that demand for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would boom. The group has adapted its menus with full offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
With another leading group, Andilana, which has 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to preferred reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made it impossible to maintain previous year's prices with menus for every taste from 19,95 to 30 euros," he explains.
At AN Grup, which directs El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locals, optimism is not lost, since the second quarter has seen revenue flourishing and good, although even on a few days concentrated prospects for the Christmas business.
The sources of the corporate group point out that the 18th day will also be an overactive day with groups of friends celebrating Christmas.
A Christmas menu was added to the six group menus for 30 euros or more than prishit. One has the impression that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and in return want more details, such as Cava.
Also in some companies you can see green sprouts, which is why the employees are invited again. This gives the impression that the group dinners are back in the upswing.
On the sides of the umbrella association Fecasarm (with mergers such as the club of clubs, restaurant and leisure association of Barcelona), the deputy chairman, Enric Gomà, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are generally quite "viable", even though the customers "exceed a maximum".
The fun at the celebration, however, had not gone back, no matter who pays.
Pakistan's nuclear programme is causing great concern in the US
Islamabad manufactures nuclear weapons "faster than any other country".
WikiLeaks' disclosures confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department revealed by Wikileaks Internet portal confirms the enormous concerns of Pakistan's Washington nuclear program.
On the margins of the clarification and juicy details that the documents on the content of the talks and the thinking of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad reveal that the cooperation between the two countries in matters of nuclear security is not strengthened but, on the contrary, "decreases" and that the unstable Asian country produces more nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country".
In particular, the very nature of the Pakistani nuclear program - that the weapons are not assembled, but their individual parts are stored to make their destruction difficult - Washington prepares sleepless nights in a possible attack.
The following risks are mentioned by the ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before the visit of the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the Taliban-attacked area, the probable dispersal of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material".
The large number of people who are implicated in the nuclear arsenals and rocket programs is no longer considered by the United States alone, but also by Russia as a far-reaching and reason to exercise caution.
"Pakistan needs to employ strictly believing personnel to monitor nuclear installations; due to the low educational and cultural level, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit individuals who are involved in nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
New to the documentation revealed by Julian Assange's Internet portal is that the US/Pakistan cooperation is leaving behind in nuclear proliferation and the increased pace in which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the message that describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating" states: "There is often no transparency; we do not receive any answers or they are rejected."
In another communication, Peter Lavoy, State Secret Service official for South Asia, confirms that "despite the economic disaster Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as no other country."
Ambassador Patterson asked Washington during a visit by the chief army leader, General Ashfaq Kayani, to "explain to the responsible person that "Pakistan's army has to cease its silent over-support of terrorist groups."
On the hunt for Wikileaks chief
Obama appoints a high-ranking leader for the fight against anti-terrorism to prevent new revelations.
Interpol issued a red warning for the persecution and invention of Assange.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, is a complicated labyrinth in which the facts can only be found difficult to clarify.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red warning" for Assange's "invention and persecution".
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
Besides, she's not new. She's from November 20th.
It also has nothing to do with the final disclosure of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian has to face in Sweden.
The lawyer of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, also assures "the police knew where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
As early as 20th, the International Police Office, based in Lyon, France, issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it was not notified by the Swedish authorities until yesterday after the date of receipt of the power.
So the things are. The 188 Interpol countries are forced to identify Assange and find out "to arrest him for the moment and deliver him."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, many member states, according to the organization's statements, consider the red warning as a free letter of arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to remain.
Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter informing them that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is willing to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities at video conference, were dismayed.
They also recall that Assange applied for departure from Sweden and the prosecutor who was compared to the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, security chief of Stalin, who was granted the corresponding approval.
"It's like a hunt, not a legal persecution," the letter charges.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother from Australia is appalled by her son's innocence - Assange stops in an unknown place, but not silently.
On Monday he gave an interview to the head of Time magazine by Skype from an indefinite place. During the conversation he requested the resignation of the Secretary of State of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be demonstrated that it was responsible for the appointment of North American diplomats to spy on the UN and thus violated international agreements signed by the United States, it would have to resign," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the Press Secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who called the request for resignation "stupid and absurd".
"I'm not sure why we should value a guy's opinion with a website," he explained to CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a high-ranking leader for the anti-terrorism campaign, Rusell Travers, to prevent new document disclosures.
The attempt of President Barack Obama to give less attention to Assange is contrary to the views expressed by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will be chairing the National Security Committee of the House of Deputies from January onwards, has asked the State Department to investigate the possibility of adding Wikileaks to the list of terrorist organisations, "to confiscate their funds and to pursue anyone who supports them or makes a contribution."
Tom Flanagan, adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone further, and he had to recall his statement that Assange had to be "killed".
"Obama would have to turn it into a target disk and use a non-manned plane or something."
Those who did not apologize were Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former Governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever it was that made information leak in the government, he is guilty of betrayal, and all that is not execution is a punishment of his own to a mild degree," he explained to the station Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with a turn of eyes
The Republican leader allows the party a secret vote on its continued existence in the office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralist government and the end of the principle of assembly.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to get out of the ranks for the tenth time of an internal riot after the loss of 11 MEPs and half of the voters' votes.
The party chairman is aware that his resignation threat is not enough for the former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector today is as weakened as its mentor himself and will not cause the same headache as other previous currents.
That is why the leader of Esquerra is trying to win the new critics with a blind eye, which would secure his position up to the next municipal elections.
Yesterday, at the beginning, the more than 200 regional councillors of ERC were able to make a secret statement about their stay in the office.
With ballots, not with a high hand.
If the carodists wanted to miss a penal code for the president, they could do so without having to fear reprisals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and that of submission among his person.
In several interviews he confirmed that he would feel himself with half of the votes plus one not confirmed, and he added without mentioning percentages, a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The Carod close-ups demand more from the president than only to make his office available to the party. An insufficient gesture as Puigcercós controls the supreme body of congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force withdrawals, they will agree with the Executive Board a plan of action from now until May.
To this end, they expect to be able to participate in the preparation of the document on strategic reorientation, that the leadership will be able to vote on 18th.
Their intention is to protect Puigcercós. In return, this one is to promise to present the Congress in autumn 2011, which the party leader already believes to be a fact.
The party chairman of the ERC believes that the "polyphony" is damaging stability and he strives once and for all to enable the organization to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by Conseller Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
In view of the fact that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the owner of Innovació considered it a fact that the party chairman was supported "in exchange for various purposes".
He counted five, two of which are in the foreground.
First, the board's "restructuring" to represent at least 90 percent of the party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the great news.
Huguet suggests that the ERC should finally abandon the general meeting principle as a way of working.
He is thus fighting for a reform of the statutes, which should allow congresses to hold with elected delegates.
Puigcercós' team, who fought for it at the last two congresses, is obsessed about the end of the assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system.
In fact, the party leadership was instructed to review the general meeting principle at a Congress to deal with the reform of the Statutes at the meeting of 2008.
This date is still awaited, as the internal uprising of the last few years was not advisable on this matter.
Now, without the critical sectors lying on top of it, the time could have come to take this matter up again and finish it forever.
23 Murdered in November, 290 in 2010
According to MILENIO, four cases were recorded in México less than 2010.
In November, 23 people were murdered in México, according to the accounts of MILENIO México, which are four less than in the previous month.

The man had a wound that came from the shot of a firearm in his neck.
In the middle of the month, two men were killed, encased in blankets and discovered in the trunk of a vehicle abandoned on the streets of Villas de la Hacienda of the municipality of Tizapán de Zaragoza. In addition to the victims, two threats of murder were found.
One day later a human head was found in a cardboard box in the village of Valle de los Reyes in the village of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby settlement, the rest of the body was found in a black plastic bag with a message signed by El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two dead women in the Zoquiapan settlement were discovered in Ixtapaluca and the next morning, Huixquilucan found the body wrapped in a yellow-blue ceiling of a man who, according to the news his murderers left next to him, probably named Mario Ríos.
In the settlement of San Francisco Acuautla of Ixtapaluca, the lifeless body of a woman was found with shots of firearms in the neck.
On the woman's skin tattoos of Santa Muerte and chains with corresponding pictures were discovered.
In the last half of the month, the body of a man with at least three hits and a message signed by a criminal group were found in the municipality of Zinacantepec next to a vehicle.
Two days later, the bodies were discovered by two men whose heads were covered with adhesive tape, and a message was discovered in the municipality of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
Against the body was probably a message signed by a criminal organization on which it said: "This happens to those who do not participate."
Two bodies tied to hands and feet were found in Ecatepec with torture marks inside a taxi station located behind the San Agustín judicial centre.
On the last day of the month, the bodies were discovered by two men in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first one had been purchased in the village of Cuchilla Ancón and tied in black plastic bags, there was a message. The second one had been tortured and found in the streets of the settlement of Juárez in a plastic bag.
Next to him, the police found a father with a message.
China maintains its GHG reduction targets
China's representative stated at COP16 that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon traces and would maintain its offer of reducing 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China keeps its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, assures Su Wei, the representative of this country at COP16.
During his first public appearance at the 16th World Climate Summit of the United Nations (COP16) Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon traces and to change its industry.
He explained that over the last four years, his country has invested $245 million to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its objectives but would work with the international community on this matter.
He explained that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
In all aspects, progress has been made, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which included the objectives for the reduction of gas emissions.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China the authorities of the states had cooperated with those of the central state and the communities in order to achieve the goals of energy saving, efficient use of energy and reduction of emissions.
In addition, he explained that a number of multiannual plans have already been adopted or concluded, both those financed by the Chinese Government and those received from other countries.
For example, he referred to the programme for the effective use of energy introduced in the last five years and received investment from the United Nations (UNO), the government and private.
There is also a project on climate change at provincial level, another on the exchange of traditional light bulbs through energy spars and another on weakening and adaptation, he explained.
Martin Krol, scientific government adviser on climate change in this country, confirmed that China’s efforts would be far greater than would be generally accepted.
He showed that greenhouse gas emissions per capita in China accounted for six tons per person, while in the United States it was 100 tons. China is responsible for a nine percent total contribution to environmental pollution.
Similarly, it makes unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. Energy efficiency has been increased by twenty percent over the last five years and will be further achieved by 2020, he said.
Legal exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN stated that the former president of the Panist Party had the right to turn to the National Order Commission and to ask for what the right granted him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barriento was right and that the former party chairman of the PAN had the right to turn to the National Order Commission and to demand what the right granted him.
In an interview, which took place prior to the complaint by Gabino Cué Monteagudos as governor of the state, he stated that Espinos' exclusion was a decision that had been made at the local level.
"It is an independent decision of the Order Commission in Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right, in his case, to contact the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional for a decision to be taken by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he stated that it was not time to think of 2012 and that an alliance with the presidential candidate had never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional strengthened from the internal vote on the next 4th and 5th of December, in which his successor was elected.
"The (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that was never on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a pretext for the municipal elections, it was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he explained.
The Panist leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, therefore "does not scare us of internal competition; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly choose the best chairman or chairman, the Acción Nacional, for the next three years. Therefore, he handed over the staff "to those whom the Council would determine."
"I am completely unconcerned and open. I would be proud to assign each of the five to the office of the party chairman."
He predicted that the party's recent election of July 4 will be reflected in the next elections, although "it is not time to think about 2012."
"Now it is about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments, which emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa, would bear the flag and be observed throughout the country. That is why "many hopes and aspirations are put in them and I am sure that Gabino is at the height of the demands."
When he was questioned about the criticism of the PRI on the President Felipe Calderón for his discourse in the framework of his four-year government, César Nava invited the PRI supporters to reflect on the six-year period of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should start defending them, they should finally come out of the closet," he affirmed.
He believes that the owner of the federal government expresses such expressions as those he could make in his discourse in Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there would be no oral prohibition and even less censorship.
Obama works in Twitter for the law in favour of undocumented students
"If you are in favour of the adoption of the Dream Act law, then call your senators and press for the adoption of this law," the president of the United States tweeted in the popular social network.
Today, President Barack Obama supported national mobilisation to support the Dream Act - Law on Legalization of Undocumented Students with a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act law, then call your senators and press for the adoption of this law," Obama tweeted.
His brief statement contains a cyberlink to a more comprehensive document that calls on the public to come into contact with their senators, as the vote of the law is imminent.
"With your voice that we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he emphasizes.
The news was spread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes for each law, except for the extension of tax reductions from Bush's times and the funding of the government would be extended.
Such a blockade, announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republicans, could affect the vote of the Dream Act - law and other projects such as ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Commenting on the blockade of Republicans of the law Dream Act and other projects, President Robert Gibbs said he trusted that once the tax theme had been resolved, a timetable could be drawn up for the other projects.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax matter must be settled before the end of the year..."
"I believe that we can make an agreement about this at any time and then we can plan the outcome of the rest," he said.
The president of the Democratic Majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "he would request a vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act - law, with which the initiative to legalise undocumented students could be voted on in the Senate from next Thursday, although the next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act, or the law of the American dream, would legalize about 800 000 young people who immigrated to the United States when they were not yet sixteen years old while living in that country for the last five years and were enrolled in a higher educational institution or army.
But the advocates of the law need sixty votes to adopt the initiative, which is why they rely on the voices of a handful of Republicans. At present, the organisations of the advocates of this project are organising an intensive influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, said he would vote against and only a Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, announced his support of the law.
That is why the defenders of the Dream Act must have several Republicans on their side if other democrats are to decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
The most republished Republicans are those from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they explained that they would not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had spoken out for the law, John McCain, has not yet established his position.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, the analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate is facing the biggest obstacles.
Put your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The desire for the language' was a walk in which the participants made themselves strong for the story
"I understand that with sex in language, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated Spanish-speaking literature and on this occasion used the subtitle of her question (at another event the round table was dedicated to sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "brings us in trouble", the Argentinean writer spit sweetly at the audience, composed mainly of young people gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this moderated round table by Marisol Shultz, attended by Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text she devoted to Gonzalo Celorio, and then named the shultz as a great story. Luisa tells in first person and is the protagonist who is looking to learn what a "wound" is, and goes from doctor to doctor, of whom she does not receive an answer, but notes for the guide of her narrative.
Infectiousologists are convinced that "Patience is not my strength, perhaps it is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist who took her breath in the middle of the corridor, and who explains to her that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalyst removes the secret: "The wound is really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the narrative sighs and concludes that "it was only learned from the wound that it was really open and nonexistent." But it is convinced that the desire for language and its traps mix.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful narrative, which he called 'the praise of the invention', and in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned, but discovered.
With allusions to magical realism, he tells of a famous magician who touched the clouds, brought back well-traveled men or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The narrative made a turnaround and reported on by America, the great novel that it did not lack from the beginning to its own chroniclers, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticized the abundance of the stories told by the conquerors.
"Cervantes, who invited all of us (the writers), mocked the false witnesses who appeared in the true stories, but in other ways the history of America would never have been told - with imagination, which even lost the sense of shame."
However, he points out, "it is the crazies and liars who imagine things best," and there reality and lies draw closer to each other, where one no longer knows, to which side the narrative belongs, where fictional literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls it the 'Traditional Cervantes'.
"From him we have inherited to be what is told."
When Mayra Montero was in the row, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations that the FIL had contributed to the round table 'The Finger in the Wound'.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican women devoted their contribution to the great wounds of social violence that their country, like Latin America as a result of the fight for drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a silent, unplanned commitment," she explained after stressing that literature is communication and commitment that builds up between the author and the readers as in a "chemical reaction".
In the evening, the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution was also "this finger of the committed writer in the wound of the writer", decided hevorhob.
He noted that in a fast-paced world, the intellectual habits and control of consciousness are also running out on dogmatisms, and will forget, "that behind every confirmation there is a small no and behind every denial a small yes."
"To be owned by our thoughts and reality, we must nuance: and nuances often mean to put the finger in the wound and to harass those who feel much more comfortable when they think in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in prefabricated ideas without nuances, and also the powerful ones who prefer to divide the world into black and white, he noticed and invited to rediscover the meaning of writing.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in playoffs, he has experienced Aps and Abs in his career, but he played decisive games three times.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end of the game, there are also two different styles opposite their respective trainers, and their encounter, marked by opposites, is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in playoffs, he has experienced Aps and Abs in his career, but he has had decisive games three times, and so far he has kept himself well, which is why this opportunity is of particular importance to him.
The Argentinian played with the medal to the second champion, he stayed behind the victors and, surprisingly, he played consecutive final games with the same team.
The Santist stratege was the first to finish the 'Torneo Apertura 2002' when Del Morelia had the reins in his hand, with which he experienced a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', where they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to strike again, since the game ended 2-2 against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but at the eleven-meter he came forward with 3-1 and got two ways to record his title, but finally three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two final games with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his big rival. Therefore, he does not want to be persecuted again by the misfortune and free himself from the evil spell, in order to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he confirms that the most important game for him is the game itself.
"I want to become a champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for my affection, and that's why the title will come to me, but what happened before is the most important thing," said the tax collector when asked about the lost final games.
The last final game has remained strong in his memory, he assures him to have learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can draw from is that until the referee doesn't whistle the end, we can't celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players too, because the last time we were already prepared to leave with two eleven meters, and I believe that this is a lesson until the game is not finished, there is no reason to celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be decided by Elfmeter shootings, he does not worry, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at the eleven-meter shooting, you want to finish in the regular playing time, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately the fate prepared us a bad game, sometimes due to nervousness or the fierce striving to hold the title already in your hands, which left us something for this final game, and we hope it won't come this time."
It is in Romanso's power not to be just second champion and to taste for the first time the glory that the titles bring.
The US is changing the rules for obtaining a visa
Before talking to the Consulate, the persons must present themselves to the services to apply for visas; the costs will be reduced accordingly.
As from 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa are changed in the United States Embassy and in the Consulates.
For the new procedure, most applicants will have to present themselves before their consultation at the consulate at the visa application service (ASC, the initial letters in English).
The ASC staff shall record the applicant's biometric data, which shall be verified by the consulate prior to the interview.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total cost of the processing of the visa is reduced, as it is no longer necessary to pay separately the appointment, the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is handed out.
The applicant shall make only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the counterpart to 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visas with application (including visas for time workers) and 390 dollars for hands and investors.
Those who only wish to extend their visas do not need to have a conversation in the consulate, they only have to introduce themselves to the nearest ASC, where they present their documents and their fingerprints are taken.
Since the biometric data are collected in the ASC, the applicants who need a second appointment for the conversation in the consulate remain there less time than before.
Those applying for the visa in the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo must no longer pay the service charge of 26 dollars.
You can find additional information on the new visa application procedure in the following web site: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the discovery of alien life
The North American space agency called a press conference to present tomorrow a find that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Aviation and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States announces tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of alien life.
The find will be presented tomorrow at a press conference at NASA's headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology. This is a science that explores the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When the press conference was convened, NASA assured them that it would present "a supervisory fund for the search for alien life", which triggered speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that it can exist in hostile environments that have previously been considered uninhabitable, human-like creatures. The hypothesis was raised that if their living conditions improved, they could turn into intelligent beings, such as human beings.
It appears to be a microbe found on the basis of Mono Lake in the Yosemite National Park, California. It lives there in an environment that was thought too toxic for all possible life forms, since the lake is highly arsenal.
In some way, the microbe uses the arsenic as a survival resource. Taking into account this ability, the chances increase that there may be similar lives on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms change the arsenic, according to the astrobiologists, it has been shown that "there is actually another form of life, a second form of life that is different from the one we know."
The Space Agency will announce the actual reach of its findings at the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference is attended by the geobiologists Pamela Conrad, who investigates the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studies Titan (the largest moon of Saturn) under the question of whether his chemical composition is similar to the Earth.
Gest PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition block
The reform of the body law on Congress introduced the two-party system, they complain.
The 60th Legislature period had just begun, and already installed an opposition block, led by the members of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesus Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who imagined themselves as an independent. The four questioned the following: the introduction of the 'two-party system' into the chamber.
Prior to the beginning of the introductory session in the 60th legislative period, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo weathered the reform of the organ law, as it would exclude them.
With this reform, they repeated, a 'two-party system' would be introduced, because now there would be two people, the same number as parties that controlled the Congress.
These four Members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Bureau, led by the Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in its capacity as Vice-Chairman.
Corvera Quevedo stated that the parties PRI and PAN had institutionally introduced their political marginalisation with these reforms.
He explained that in the next few days they would speak to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme. They went out of their political will, and if they did not, they would again be unjustly wronged by both parties, thereby ending the opposition coalition.
"Up to this I come (the opposition coalition), that is what I see, because we will be excluded from all decisions that do not even take into account the opinion of the others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia stated that there were similarities with PRD, PT and Patrón and that therefore a pluralist group would be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued that, after being monopolistic, the Congress should now be "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of law reform that an eternal two-party system should prevail in Congress."
"For the start, this group starts with five members and they talk to other colleagues to make them more," said the Convergencia member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, in an allusion to PAN and PRI, stated that the Congress had now turned into a 'fence' for two.
"Before it was just a party, now they split it up into two."
Patrón Montalvo requested to respect the MPs and to assign them their place to the negotiating tables.
"Five who are likely to be nine Members should not be allowed to go outside because the five who are currently seen as being split up into different groups have decided to join forces to take our place at the negotiating table, because because of the reform that was carried out and agreed by the others, we have stayed outside and we do not agree with this reform."
200 000 peso more for "the supply"
The city administration of Mazatlán pays another cheque to the controversial owner of the company for electrical materials.
Another check over just over 200 000 peso in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
This amounts to 1,200 000 pesos, which was paid to the owner of the company for electrical equipment in the second half of the year.
According to the page for more transparency of the city administration, this cheque, issued for an amount of 200,144,56 peso, was issued with the number 9258447 last 16 November with the purpose of "billing open invoices".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already announced that more money would go from the municipality to these suppliers. It is observed by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because it sells at excessive prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount that is still owed to her and consequently the number of cheques that are still being issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing was bought from her, it just pays the debts, just like the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "appeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two of 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and this last of 16 November.
Although the suppliers have not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law, if a company is challenged by the ASE in order to avoid other administrations applying for their services, the treasurer assured that their services would not be used again.
After the newspaper Noroeste had published on July 25 the audit of the cheques issued by the city administration to its suppliers, it was announced that from March 2008 until July 9, 2010, during the three-year term of the mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had paid over 10 million pesos with 42 cheques to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also shops with Jumapam where they took checks worth over 3 million peso.
Tourist places need to be improved
Tourist companies regret the accident of foreign tourists due to the poor condition of the Gloria Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist into the collapse of the Glorita Sánchez Taboada, the tourist industry of Mazatlán requested special attention from the authorities, the areas in poor condition and throw a bad picture on the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorada dealership, recalled that on different occasions, the destination was called upon to care for and the bad conditions that tourists find to transform into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said that the bad condition of the streets and pedestrian paths had had a negative effect, as the tourists had come to slop and saw the disorder, and they would turn their backs on the nearby shops.
"The politicians don't know what it means to close a company one day and they don't think about how much money you lose, because otherwise they wouldn't do the construction in this way slowly and planlessly."
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist had made the missing prevention and maintenance work out of the city clear.
"The community must assume its responsibilities and avoid this happening again. How it should do this? Well, by preventive maintenance instead of improving everything afterwards," he said.
"We are looking forward to having a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area, it must be maintained, but also we residents have a right to a clean living space. The city administration must change its strategy in order to maintain the city in good condition."
"There are other places that also look unkept and unfinished," he said, "e.g. el Escudo y el Venadito by Mazatlán."
"Today we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. A good product has to be offered, a city that cleans its beaches and streets, and keeps the tourist attractions constantly in check," he added.
"These precautions have not been given enough attention and these kinds of incidents simply state what is obvious to all: a maintenance is urgently necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Sub-Secretary of Promoción Turística, expressed the importance of saving the tourist places of Mazatlán, because they were not properly used and had a bad image created.
He mentioned a number of places that would have to be brought to the forefront together with the city. To make the city clean, tidy and attractive for tourism should be a priority.
"Happyly, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites that need to be cleaned up and cleaned up first to make them attractive to tourism and to bring them to the inventory with which we advertise for this destination.
IP Requests Congress Results
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE, proposed that MEPs take the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
The company industry of Mazatlán calls for a worthy parliament, free from agreements between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa has been puffed up and is facing major problems.
Yesterday the 60th Parliament was inaugurated. It consists of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and one of PVEM. That makes a total of 40 people representatives.
The new members of the Congress of States are expected to do a clean job, feel committed to society and the different social groups, who depend on responsible parliamentary work, and that they do not repeat the same patterns of partyism and patriotism.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE Entrepreneur Coordination Council, suggested that the new Members should take on the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
"We hope that Members will really exercise their right to act freely between the parties, because it is customary for them to make agreements with whom they represent their own interests, thereby transforming themselves into carnival-comparses of the rulers and the leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said that they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We take care that they carry out a trustworthy work and work for society and its groups above all, because it was the people of Sinaloa who expressed their confidence in them during the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, chairman of the Tres Islas hotel association, said that one of the major challenges facing the 40 people's representatives was the drive and joint work for the economic growth of the state, since today's economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will somehow promote job creation."
With regard to the tourism sector, he called on the new MEPs to give the necessary importance to the Ministry of Tourism in the state budget in order to promote it.
"I have understood that it is the Ministry with the second-less resources, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment to the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industry."
Tourist projects must be allocated funds, state security must be supported, and the alcohol law, which has not been revised in previous legislative periods, must be brought up to date.
Holy King Seeked
Dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys wish the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family longing.
For the parents it will be difficult to fulfill these wishes on the next day of the king’s day, because the household is no longer composed of twelve people and a goat’s goat.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up the hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothing they so desire.
The family inhabits a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live from hand to mouth, because the father does not have a firm job.
"Sometimes hard times are called because my husband doesn't have a job. But we sell mandarins and potatoes... Already in the afternoon I go with the doers to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaida would like to have a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
Ten-year-old José Alfredo has wanted a 'monster van' for some time now and for his eight-month-old brother Jesus proposes Cayetana clothes in size for one-year-olds.
" (José Alfredo) told me, 'I would like this monster so much,' but I answered him, 'let's wait, boy, because it was very expensive', Cayetana remembered sadly.
For the older children who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
The eleven-year-old María Guadalupe has the size of 12, the ten-year-old Isaías the size of 10, while the eight-year-old Miguel the size of 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. Couples of size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the 'Holy King is sought' campaign by donating a toy or cash in the reception hall of the newspaper Noroeste.
14 Suspect Drug Dealer Arrested
On Wednesday, around ten house searches were carried out in the management region of Estrie in the context of the dismantling of a production and sales network of cannabis.
Fourteen people were arrested and will face various charges.
The house searches were carried out in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, in places that were supposed to have served mainly in drug production.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment that have served the production have been confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Quebec Security Police.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, two of whom came from Sherbrooke, who are considered to be the main drug addict.
The arrested persons are supposed to have appeared hours after their arrest in front of the Sherbrooke Justice Building.
They could, among other things, be accused of the production of cannabis, its property for sale, the plot and the service of crime.
These house searches were carried out as a result of a lengthy investigation that took place for over a year.
"The information received from the public has enabled us to carry out these arrests," M. Ruel explained.
Around 70 police officers of the Quebec National Security Police Unit, Sherbrooke Police Department and the Memphrémagog Police Department took part in this police operation.
Secret immigration could be pursued without problems
The draft law of the Conservatives, which, according to the government, is to regulate the problem of ships loaded with secret immigrants, will all be stamped in foregleam after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I strongly object to this Charter."
"I am holding a party that has tied you to your feet," said Michael Ignatieff, head of the Liberals, after the weekly Caucus session before the assembled MPs.
The Liberals claimed that the draft law, which allows any person coming from a seaship identified as transporting illegal immigrants for up to one year, is in breach as proposed by the Canadian Constitution of Law and Freedom.
Gilles Duceppe, head of Bloc Québécois, also indicated that he was unable to support the draft law, since he opposed the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait for what the government is doing," explained M. Duceppe.
The criticism of Olivia Chow's immigration issue, NDP, has left the critics who demand that their party did not stand firm enough against the secret immigrants.
"The Neo-Democrats agree to take measures against the blind passengers, and we are just trying to implement this by means of another draft law, the C-35," Chow said.
We do not therefore support the draft law of the Conservatives because he is looking for blame for the refugees and holds children captive for at least one year," said Chow.
Minister of Immigration Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring the will of the Canadians.
"The Canadians strongly inform the MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of secret immigration, these criminal acts that concern Canada and that treat the country as a step-by-step."
"They expect Canada to take tough action," said Minister Kenney's reaction.
"The government has not announced any vote of confidence in its draft law that could have led the country to elections that the government had rejected.
However, a conservative has said to the QMI agency that the government would convene a vote so that any opposition Members would immediately explain themselves to their constituents.
The new unit does not find unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a new, standing unit to fight corruption and conflict by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the formation of a public inquiry committee on this subject.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea did not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue last January.
The metropolis has a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
Nevertheless, the announcement of Wednesday has surprised more than just one.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed in the least on the occasion of the meeting of the Permanent Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
Nor was it lacking that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the party Québécois qualified this announcement in pointo public security as "an enchanted rabbit from the hat" and "a solution rightly built at a table end".
Minister Dutil, in turn, had turned to those who fear that political power has too much influence on future unity.
"They will see the result when we will announce it," he was pleased to confirm.
"You are aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, the President of the CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public survey.
"The more M. Charest insists on preventing the formation of this investigation committee, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he explained.
"The only way to be able to form an investigation committee is the resignation of Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, lecturer of ethics and policy systems at the ENA (the State University for the Training of High Administrative Officers).
To get out of this dead end, he proposes to Quebec to grant financial control a special mandate to enable them to conduct investigations on corruption and secret agreements.
"One should be able to extend the audit audit audit mandate," he decided.
He also believes that the Quebec audit could grant the same powers as commissioners, which would also allow her to commit the people to the statement.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the government Charest.
Quebec will also demand Ottawa to amend the criminal law so as to be better prepared for this kind of crime.
This demand comes from the Supreme Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not clear in this way of prosecution.
Vic Tows, Minister of State for Public Security, confirmed his colleague from the Judiciary, Rob Nicholson, was currently dealing with certain amendments concerning this dossier.
During Operation Printemps 2001, which affected the groups of motorbike police, 131 persons had been arrested, although the Criminal Law had not been revised.
Ottawa has enforced the law against gangsterdom as a result.
Flows under strict supervision
Several rivers remain under strict surveillance due to the high rainfall which has occurred in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, in the Mauricie administrative region, there was a landslide on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening, another landslide took place in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
A road is collapsing in it.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening strong rainfalls from 40 to 70 millilitres of rainfall have occurred in several regions.
Between 20 and 40 more millimeters of rainfall were expected here according to the regions until Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
Here, a total of up to 100 millimeters of rain showers had gone down.
As these rainfalls are added to the melting of snow that has already accumulated in certain sub-areas, the abundance of several streams is feared.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Security Service issued warnings on the flood alarm regarding the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in the region of Lanaudiere.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentine mountains and in the Chêne in Lotbinière become the object of flood monitoring and remain under observation.
In the region of Lanaudière, the severe rainfall has led to the breaking of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, an escape bridge was removed due to the heavy rains.
Ten residents had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais the crossing of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service continues to be alert and closely monitor the situation, according to Security Council Annik Bouchard.
On Wednesday, the Quebec High Waters Centre issued warning of the strong rise of several rivers, in particular Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially assigned
The Quebec broadcast moderator Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback in front of the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Supervisory Board (CCNR) because of its controversial statements about social welfare services and Haitians, as well as because of his outstanding speech about radio.
The CCNR is of the opinion that M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team would have the right to express their opinion, but certain statements "would have contained inaccurate information about the social welfare and unjustified negative representations of the Haitians as well as such an unbridled statement that is not appropriate to the day-to-day broadcasts."
The Supervisory Board had also concluded that a discussion on suicides involving the spread of the names of two persons who committed suicides was contrary to the Radio Code.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding the submissions made during the 2008 and 2010 broadcasts.
The first order was filed as a result of a complaint by the "Front Commune des personnes assistées sociales du Québec".
The activist organisation had complained that the amounts mentioned in the shipment were not accurate.
The presenters should rather give solid information as misleading information.
On the subject of suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont had expressed the opinion that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the Supervisory Board members had concluded that the message sent was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account the fact that the consequences of the "Dupont le midi" programme have been a sensitive issue in a family-friendly and appropriate way."
Therefore, he was seized with no blame on his person.
The final dispute concerned the statements related to the earthquake in Haiti.
In this regard, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had given themselves a media-effective dispute that caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had declared not to have donated in favour of Haiti's assistance, as it would not be certain that the needy would actually receive the donations.
The Supervisory Board is of the opinion that these comments have not been of any abusive character, but that their cumulative effect presents an unjustified negative representation of the Haitians.
"I have already paid my three-day suspension penalty in this matter."
"My file has been virgin for one and a half years," said the moderator.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Board recommends the dissemination of an unspoiled expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM broadcaster acted "outside its obligations".
The consequences for the broadcaster, which should have communicated its decisions once and for all during the main time of transmission within a period of three days, are minor.
A king of Kung-Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, Montreal’s Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who in "Sanda" (full contact Kung-Fu), in the kickboxes as well as in the Thai box, is now rising in search of new challenges to the Tatami and to the boxing rings of the world.
"I started fighting sports in Algeria 12 years ago, such as kung fu and kickboxes," said Zemmal, who has been living in the metropolis since 2008 to further develop among the professionals.
I personally seek the fight of all places, since for those who face the ground struggle, as the mixed martial arts present to him, do not like to compete in North America."
He had recently given bad news to his rivals working as a security officer, as well as to the UPS company, in which he received two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) from the world championship held in Edinburgh, Scotland between 23 and 30 October.
"I won the victory in the categories of full contact with Kickboxen and Thai boxen," he explained.
"At the time, I'm preparing for the World Cup in San Shou, China."
"There were those fighters from every category who had placed themselves among the first four at the last World Championship."
"I was babed in Toronto in 2009 and fetched bronze."
"In 2005 I became a hero in Vietnam."
"In 2007 I finished the tournament in China in fifth place while I became a third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"It is worth mentioning that I have made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm I will be the first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines from China, where fist strokes and footsteps are permitted as well as floorings.
The two battles usually play on a platform, more rarely in a boxing ring.
The most prestigious boxer who has emerged from this kind of martial arts is the American Vietnamese origin Cung Le, which is probably known in the world of martial arts.
Should Nacer Zemmal retain only one event in his career, he would certainly call his presence here at the Super Tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of Kung-Fu.
"This contest is the highest and most prestigious in China," said the sympathetic Poundsman.
"It's a bit like the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"That was a great experience."
Zemmal had won his first battle in the semifinals of his category (80kg) before losing in the finals.
"He who defeated me was a real professional," he analyzed.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals meet each other in the finals of their category."
"Then the victors of every category offer themselves the forehead to crown a single champion, the king of the kung fu."
450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro-Québec has agreed, in mutual agreement, project planning companies, $450 million in contracts for the hydropower project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
In the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium, consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has received the most important share, namely that of the project management, to a sum of 295 million dollars without tender.
This consortium, called "Énergie gérance", was formed in 2004 as a follow-up to the decision of Hydro-Québec, the private sector's responsibility to deliver this important hydroelectric project amounting to a sum of 5 billion dollars.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Énergie gérance" denounced the lucrative contract without a public tender.
The Québécois party is faced with a serious ethical problem that raises the risk of distortions of competition and increases prices.
"This is a new way to cut off a game and defuse competition."
"This means that instead of doing short games in a secret way, instead of doing them in an open form," said Sylvain Simard, PQ member of the press conference yesterday.
In the early morning, Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems difficult to understand how the public interest can be served in this way.
Minister of Resources Nathalie Normandeau had responded to this in the afternoon by vehemently saying that this contract had been a shortened game.
"I remain faithful to my line," she betted, strengthening that the PQ was "unreasonable" and "missing her hard work".
She said it "tell the least" that the PQ apologized.
The model of the consortium is commonly used worldwide.
It is usually such a temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to bundle their expertise in terms of a bid for a tender for a complex project.
The "Eastmain" project has a high level of complexity in terms of its work performance.
The construction process is under way and is scheduled to be completed by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without any competition; there had already been negotiations.
Moreover, the model of the consortium in Quebec, even in relatively simple projects, is by no means an exception.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted last week, the model of the consortium used in the field of civil engineering and consulting is the subject of government investigations.
A brief overflight of the Quebec Business Register allows you to name more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be of constant duration.
In this way, for example, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC Lavaline or Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, of which there are several dozen, leads back to one and the same legal person, namely Dessau.
As for the consortium "Énergie gérance", Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the Baie James is subject to a particular labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has been paying special attention to this fact since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the major employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that the nose has shrunk about the fact that the project management contract has been approved after agreement.
"If you make a tender and there are only a few applicants, your prices will speed up."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this march and say to you: you will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea, however, is that not the price is decisive, but the understanding of the people," Laporte said.
This contract granted to the consortium "Énergie gérance" is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50,000 dollars received from the party Québécois.
The contracts were approved either by the Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the project Eastmain-1-A-sarcelle-Rupert.
After verification, the newspaper "Le Devoir" counted more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts awarded to companies or their branches, including, in particular, resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had signed 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16 contracts, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without including their participation in "Énergie gérance".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449 783 344, including the contract with "Énergie gérance" over $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard had stated that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) of the "Parti libéral du Québec" are probably known.
Minister Normandeau had made it sound that the PQ was equally connected with the companies they "funded" before she specified that it was more about their managers.
Barometer Consultant consumption - The "green" label is not trusted
Greener, but unscrupulous skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main actors of sustainable growth, but also little in the brands or eco-labels to control his choice.
Harm, although it bathes in a media-efficient universe, where it is only in favour of information in favour of more responsible consumption: the barometer's responsible consumption has a lack of credible information to complain of an inadequacy that makes itself known as the brake of its commitment as the first reading that was held yesterday.
Although they have driven forward the consumption of so-called socially-accepted products in 2010, the Quebecers still seem to have little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of the Quebec population admit that, in fact, they have no faith in the environmental commitment of the companies as well as green corporate advertising, the instrument of measurement, which is delineated by the responsible consumer centre of the University of Sherbrooke, betrays.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the trustworthiness of official certificates attached to supposedly fair products, as well as the credibility of products and brands that declare themselves to be environmentally conscious, says the barometer.
According to the same pattern, the discourse of politicians on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the population of Quebec.
However, the information on responsible consumption seems important for the stimulation of this consumer segment, which is currently alive by almost a third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, emptiness and doubtful nature of the information dampened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
According to the higher price of the products, this is the second brake identified by the barometer.
In addition, one third of Quebecers are distrustful of the declared performance of the green products and services they are trying to lay down.
According to another communication, more than half of consumers had changed their habits in 2010 and changed the brand of one or more products to express their beliefs.
According to Barometer, they also preferred 61% purchases from retailers in their district and favoured the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and more responsible - the index of environmentally conscious consumption had reached 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the Homo consumer of Quebec loves to present himself as king of recycling, who tries to reduce his traces left in the environment by taking care of animal protection.
But the social and environmental awareness seems to be holding back from his car, according to the barometer: just 28% of Quebecers have indicated that they have used public transport in 2010, or that they have preferred the driving center to demonstrate their environmental interest.
The addition and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavioral survey, which feeds the cliché performances.
Government bond for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec government, which was invited by Société Angus and the company Parallèle to participate financially in the acquisition of the cinema complex eXcentris, agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer company Angus as well as the company Parallèle, which had hoped to make a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over the cinema complex of Daniel Langlois on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent, in order to return to its real cinematic function, apparently did not receive what they requested.
Although the government has accepted to involve itself in this matter, at its own terms and conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government offers a bond at a lower level than the initially expected amount, which could create an existential solution to favourable conditions, at least in the opinion of the sources that can be taken from the state rumors.
A first action plan as well as a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by the last spring of Quebec, the bid request has been re-corrected so far.
A proposal, together with an action plan, has already been sent by the President of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who is head of the eXcentris file.
Several days ago, he had given her a final factual report.
However, the counter-proposal of the Cabinet was sent to SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31 December time to respond to these.
In any case, the premise of the state donation really seems to have been pushed aside.
Let us recall that the Quebec owners of cinemas and cinema complexes had opposed a direct government investment to support the acquisition of eXcentris by presenting the argument that the Minister of Culture did not have any financial assistance for real estate projects there which he did not have to provide to other cinema halls.
However, several other market participants in the segment complained about substantial economic aid in contrast.
Cinematographer Daniel Langlois had presented the author's cinema in the premises of his cinema complex for over ten years after the self-funded design of the cinema, which could justify the exception on the side of the treasury.
The lack of cinema halls showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew to keep his clientele at the bar.
The Société Angus as well as the company Parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the top of the list, they are taxing a privately funded campaign, which they hope to raise a sum of $700 000 to drive the acquisition.
Since spring 2009 only one screen continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The goal of the future buyer is to reopen the three cinema halls on February 27 next year with the performance of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
Christian Yaccarini, however, did not cancel the newspaper "Le Devoir" and was ignored what he and his group held from the downwards proposals they made to them.
Secret of Complexly Shaken Canada Ventilated
The new American diplomatic lines, which were spread by WikiLeaks, revealed the mystery of what the United Nations considers to be the inferiority complex of the Canadians to the Americans, but with the same blow they reveal the latter feeling of superiority to Canada.
Consequently, the American diplomats are amazed at the fact that the Canadian electorate does not have Canadian-American relations at the time of the election, and they believe that the visit of President Obama would have helped the conservative government to implement its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were published in public yesterday, offer even more piercing details than the mere substantial content to be tapped at.
A link dated 22 September 2008, i.e. during the time when the federal election campaign was in full swing, reports on the point from which the United Nations no longer participates in the efforts discussed by its political leaders.
To the great amazement of David Wilkins, the American ambassador employed in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations of this situation.
"The Canadian political leaders may be much more inclined to talk about internal issues of everyday life than the United States in this election to push the black Peter (as in 1988 at the campaign on free trade)" he describes.
The United Nations, as he concludes, is thus "the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of him".
The ambassador understands this "heart-breathing silence" all the less, as the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
"Smartly," he says, "it would be the ability of a candidate, a party and much more of a party leader to lead such an essential relationship that the electorate has as a key factor in the sense of originality."
The other expression of this feeling of importance is in the communication sent by Terry Breese, a business leader in Ottawa on 22 January 2009 to prepare President Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help to ensure that the government continues with the vote of confidence on the federal budget at the beginning of February, in which Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade, which has emerged from a revival program of 30 to 40 billion dollars," says Breese.
Nowhere had he mentioned that the government had had to delay the parliamentary session before Christmas in order to prevent Parliament from being overthrown by the coalition and the continued existence of opposition parties would have an impact on the quality of the proposed revival programme.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and written by Ambassador Wilkins, informs Washington of the increasingly negative picture that the CBC broadcasts dramatic series from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about such broadcasts as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which you can observe little subtle references to Maher Alar, the "No-Fly-List" or also abductions for the purpose of hearings performed by the CIA's muscle protrusions.
Another communication goes on to explain in detail how Hillary Clintten asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting if Europe was willing to take up certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner was supposed to have answered the question yes, but on the basis of an individual "case-by-case" decision.
At the end of the meeting, as described, "he handed out to the Secretary of State a paper in muncto Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has promised to re-examine the file".
Finally, let us note that the minds are heating up with regard to the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper highly standing consultant, had explained about CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "implemented".
He had here referred to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Worldwide plan to renew lighting
The UN proposed yesterday in Cancun a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) which is close to one third of the additional reduction to be achieved in order to stabilise the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the major concrete projects which the UN hopes to implement in Cancun to compensate for the absence of compelling reduction obligations on the industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, the main problem would be avoided in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of FCKWs delivered to the earth due to lighting, if the white-flashing pears, which so far represent a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or better light-emitting diodes (LED).
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the global fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, the large emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, had committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans that would cut global FCKW emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, from this balance sheet, 5 Gt would still have to be subtracted in order to stabilise the climate increase by 2 degrees Celsius from today until 2020, in order to prevent it from being out of control.
In the white glowing pears, 95% of the energy emanates in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
The compact light bulbs reduce energy consumption by 75%, and the new LED light bulbs reduce this energy requirement by twice as much.
The compact fluorescent bulbs average between 6000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED light bulbs, such as those that the manufacturer Philips has placed on the market this week - this company has participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white light pear, indicating the savings possibilities of the exchange plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that these completely new light bulbs provide very little heat, they can also work with a rule resistance.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have indicated that compact light bulbs have reserves, because they contain mercury and that they are therefore to be disposed of as special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, except that producers provide an acceptance point.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact fluorescent bulb, but rather the coal-fired power plants that emit much more mercury to produce the electricity wasted by the white-hot pears.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired power stations emit 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report presents in detail the profits that each country would make through this international programme.
Indonesia, for example, would save a billion dollars annually when purchasing electricity and eight million tons of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power plants whose construction would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire expects to be excited about the election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for the "undated" publication of the results of the presidential election of the Ivory Coast immediately after its deadline.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to maintain its work and to announce the preliminary results without further delay," said a UN Chief Press Officer.
"He asks all the parties and institutions of the Ivory Coast to prove their responsibility and to include each initiative until provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by certain foreign governments, the election commission had passed the deadline set on Wednesday at midnight, three days after the election on Sunday, without publication of the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the President of the CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would "go ahead with work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday many calls from around the world have become loud, but the CEI may at last call out the name of the winner of the second round of the election under Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
The Gbagbo camp, however, expects the cancellation of "fraudish" voting fees in the north by the Constitutional Council, which was achieved by the ex-rebel camp of the Forces nouvelles (FN) during the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the presidency campaign of the Ivory Coast, had confirmed that the maneuvers practiced by the United Nations to intimidate the voters in the north of the country had frightened the supporters of the President to go to election.
The entire election could be cancelled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo are taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
The Gbagbo Contractors, however, are more of the opinion that the highest court of the country is not neutral, since it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely linked to Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the North, who denies any connection to the ex-rebels, has judged the delay in proclaiming election results as "unacceptable" and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far as to demand victory.
His parties reaffirm that Gbagbo block the publication of the results, knowing that he has lost; and lodge a complaint before the Constitutional Court after preventing the electoral commission from publishing the results, be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday was held for the coronation of the unification and reconciliation process of a country divided into two parts over the years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations had warned the Ivory Coast politicians that they could be held responsible in the event of possible outbursts.
Laurent Gbagbo had the first round of elections on 31 October, with 38% of the votes against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round), as a leading candidate.
Unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France is 9.3% (including the overseas departments to 9.7%) in line with the International Labour Office (IAA) in the metropolis, according to provisional seasonally adjusted data published by the Federal Statistical Office of Insee on Thursday.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is set at 2,631 million.
The figures for the second quarter were 9.3% of the working population in the metropolitan area and 9.7% involving the overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate recorded an increase of 0.1 percentage points.
In more detail, 3.4 million people in France were not employed by the metropolis in the third quarter, but wanted to find a job, including whether they were able to work every two weeks or not or whether they were looking for work.
The situation of young people on the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase of the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolitan area (+ 0.9 percentage points within three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% with the involvement of the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed, according to the IAA.
Senior citizens have seen a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482 000 of over 50-year-olds, 6.6% including overseas departments.
Only 25-49 years had benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage point over three months, +0.1 percentage points over one year) and 8.8% in France overall.
After an examination of its calculation procedures, the Federal Statistical Office of Insee has not published the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
On the other hand, Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the European Union, continues to use this method and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments) compared with 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini charged and arrested
Against Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a waste management company and brother of the president of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône region (PS), an investigation was initiated and he was sent to the prison near Aix-en-Provence in the course of an investigation into the public and suspected markets in Luynes.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with the suppression of social property, the intrusion of general goods, the heathing, the confidant in corruption, illegal bribery and possession of weapons, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is prepared to fight and intends to address all the questions that the prosecution will ask him instead of spreading brainbones."
"It's easy to imagine a series of criminal charges to him, another thing is to prove them," explained his lawyer Florence Rault of the AFP (Agence France Presse) before hearing his client.
Mr Guérini, the brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti Socialiste) in the department, had insisted on giving the judge a memorandum to his justification prior to his hearing by means of his lawyers.
A member of Guérinis, Philippe Rapezzi, was also arrested and arrested on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything different than his estate, which he had to direct, to keep running.
He would never have known about the area of business competence or the target place of the associated fund, says Simon.
In this affair, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the Public Service of the Aubagne Chamber, was also accused on Wednesday of subjugation and complicity, but then under the obligation to stay away from these acts under judicial supervision.
"My client was able to provide explanations of the facts he was accused of."
"The senior prosecutor has taken into account not depriving him of his freedom," said his lawyer Yann Arnaux.
Four more persons had been charged and released from custody on the night of Tuesday on Wednesday, including two of them under legal supervision, according to Deputy Chief Attorney Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Managing Director of the Disposal Company Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is prosecuted for "unauthorised influence and passive bribery".
Two civil servants from the Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier were also arrested, one because of the title "Intervention and Intrusion of General Goods by a Public Service Officer", the other because of "Communication in the Intrusion of Public Money".
The lifemate of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also charged with the "hire and suppression of social wealth".
Among the people opposite Guérini was Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who had recently been detained for a similar affair of fraud involving Corsica.
The flags suspected his society to have contributed to washing money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X due to suspected fraud in the award of public contracts, particularly in the waste disposal sector, will be carried out in April 2009 as a result of anonymous letters in the files of several open investigations.
From close sources of investigation it appears that the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions of the surcharge and the operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, as well as waste from the Aubagne area, as well as from certain cities of the Marseille urban catchment area (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: The Elysée Palace exaggerates its middle function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, Clotilde Reiss's fate, a young French researcher who was arrested in Iran for "spionage", held the French public in breath, put diplomacy in alertness and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All of this under the attention of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents received by WikiLeaks and reviewed by the newspaper "Le Monde" show some of the reasons for this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained its strategy to the Americans, who went so far as to give this advice on dealing with their own crisis of "given" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French authorities have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French woman did not result in the release of Majid Kakavand, a prisoner in France, and from the American justice for trade in material in favour of Iran's nuclear programme.
Finally, they put the way in which the French Bureau has tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making the idea credible, the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad has played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss, into a glaring light.
In fact, he had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomat telegram edited in Paris on 12 August 2009 is entitled "Iran: French comments on the way in which hostages are handled".
François Richier, Elysée consultant on strategic issues, was accompanied by Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained the French method to her.
They advised the Americans to make every effort to bring back their own nationals who were being held violently in Iran.
"May noise," they said, "articulately loud and clear and without omission" the words "basic human rights", "innocent debt", "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Pray this all the more, especially as the Iranians ask you not to do so."
For "stolen doesn't solve anything", past the discussion attempts over inconspicuously, the Iranians are "masters in evasive maneuvers".
Mr Richier added that the arrest of foreigners was a "common Iranian tactic" for the purpose of political extortion.
He announces the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which was due on 16 August, on the day she fled to the French Embassy) "requires payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euros bail).
And he lets it be said that the Elysée is anticipating further hostages, a phenomenon that is "enhanced".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been released from prison twelve days ago, but is still being detained in Iran.
An information was circulated: Iran's Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States demand to Iran due to illegal trade in sensitive electronic materials, has been released from prison following the decision of a judge in Paris.
The American Embassy, like many other observers, raises questions about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which pursues the illegal Iranian networks of acquisition of the material for the nuclear programme, the release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Did France buy a cow trade?
The liberation of the Iranian from that of the Frenchman ?
On the occasion of a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assures us that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "fully surprised by the judge's decision" but also tried to resist it.
"There has been a lively exchange between the French Bureau and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand is still under "severe" control of the French intelligence service.
The Elysée consultant dials a telephone number, re-registers, then informs the American diplomat, the Iranian "currently occupying the buildings led by the Iranian Embassy in Paris".
While keeping Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not spare his efforts to believe by means of announcements and media-organized "refugees", the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "impact middle role".
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and find that the manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 conjures up "the media flash of the French authorities".
What is the basis for so much "thank you" to Mr. Assad, is the question of the Paris message.
"Despite their full praise, the French authorities admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done".
The document then deals with the reasons which led the Elysée to fall victim to this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts "aim to confirm Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria", he analyses.
A policy was launched in 2008, which was perceived as premature and undeserved by numerous critics in France and abroad.
"The Syrian role is building up" tries Paris "to show Syria the promise you can make by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to sow "intertrafficking between Syria and Iran".
The American message knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier entrusted her with this: "Of course we do not know whether the Syrians have done anything".
"But in spite of everything we thanked them."
"This should at least create confusion with the Iranians".
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it in the Elysée.
In a communiqué he thanked the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favour of the release of our countrymen".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law, called "the Cinderella", which will forbid young people to play online games after midnight by blocking their access, meaning government officials.
A bill to call on the online game operators to deny access to these games to young people under 16 years of age after midnight will be presented to Parliament in December, portrayed representatives of the Ministry of Culture and Family.
"Many children play these games all night long and have difficulties in learning in school and also in living a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, the French press agency Agence France Press's minister with this draft law.
The online game is available again from 6 a.m. on the morning.
The producer companies would have a year to prepare themselves for the application of the law, so he specified.
The government is equally concerned with asking manufacturers to cut down the daily time limit granted for access to these games on the part of those young people whose parents ask for it, the responsible person added.
It will also make available free programs to those who wish to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and newspapers regularly report various events associated with intensive internet use.
The country is also an undisputed champion in global online game competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the founder country
In light of suspicion of corruption, on Thursday, the Executive Committee of FIFA appoints the founder countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Championships, a highly political choice in which the ranking of influence and lobbying threatens to push technical criteria into the background.
However, one thing is certain: the 2018 edition of FIFA's kingly discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 issue will then be somewhat more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to win new territories (Katar, Australia) in 2010 after the premiere on the African continent, or pursue its subsidiary in the United States or in Fernost (Japan, South Korea).
The list of persons associated with the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Emir of Qatar, Belgian and Dutch Heads of Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) presents the measure of the economic and political commitment of a world championship.
So the actions behind the scenes threaten to stop until the last minute.
Otherwise, difficult to set up a hierarchy of candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) file offer better arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the beginning of the revelations with the launch of the suspension of two members of the Reynald Temerii and Amos Adamu, could also have ruined the opportunities for their own country, the cradle of football, which was only allowed to take the world championship once, in 1966.
The BBC had once again given the floor on Monday by sending out a documentary report that shoots three influential members of the Committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to exasperate FIFA and embarrass the English leaders, who had been in an intense lobbying mainly with David Cameron these past weeks.
The head of government hopes for a new edition of Tony Blair's chess train, which had been completed by his predecessor, in 2005 for London, to organise the 2012 Olympic Games.
Would this intensive effort be sufficient to restore the image of England before the committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the duo Spain-Portugal is not missing from its already finished stages, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial shadows of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English, as well as the doubts about Spanish and Portugal's solvency, have increased Russia's chances of becoming a significant outsider despite its gaps in the dossier (stadia, hotels, transport).
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, however, has decided to appeal to the Committee members to point out that the British press's accusations are 'an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote'.
"You throw them with dirt, you try to compromise them," Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, seems to be the logical favorite.
First economic world power, seat of FIFA main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have separately set up a very nice project.
However, these new candidatures seem premature for two countries that had co-organised the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: the World Cup 2026 approval requested by FIFA for China, which allowed the Asian chances to fall to 2022.
With Australia and Qatar, which had all been registered with the anticipation of futuristic stages, FIFA is pursuing its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries pose a greater risk because of their certainty.
Australia, like Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the weakness of television rights acquired by the European countries (due to the time shift), the sensitive nerve of FIFA.
Second mandate: transparency
De Gaulle had really rung.
Mitterrand had let him think that he was bumping.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the slightest reluctance.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this.
A mandate in the Elysée calls for the next.
The current head of state will be ergo candidate in 2012.
But the obvious side of the mystery that the presidency's function is not well on the face.
So you have to do that as if the doubt existed from now on.
In one, as in the other sense.
In 2006, the supporters of Jacques Chirac stated that a third mandate was not excluded, without themselves believing in it.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy seriously assured him to make his decision "in the autumn of 2011".
The fact that he would sound the perspective of "two mandates" in the Elysée in front of the UMP Parliamentarians on Tuesday evening had therefore spread a little feveriness.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far from it.
The President merely reminded us that the 2008 constitutional amendment limits the number of five-year term to only two.
He made a statement, no announcement.
It is not the first time that he mentioned the presidential election on the occasion of such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You have seven and a half years with me, or at best," he told them in July 2009.
A new one in May 2010: "Don't think that I don't think about the phase after that."
His words of the day before yesterday make him no more a candidate than the day before, but no less.
Should they make comments, then for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race around the candidacy with the PS on one side.
However, it is not the admission of the competition with Ségolène Royal, which drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012, which reminds many members of the PS more early than adopted for fighting.
The bad polls on the other side.
For the first time, the right-wing voters would prefer François Fillon's candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the poll of the BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion about it with the UMP," responded the Prime Minister's environment immediately and carefully.
"If he were to be defeated as possible, he would not be a candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin says.
"He will always believe in being able to win," says Alain Juppé, who has found himself dealing with openness.
Euro: the ECB is obliged to keep its purchases of government papers
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB last year should provide an opportunity to show how the crisis emerges, or at least to announce the appointment of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to be completed by the end of the year.
The crisis of European public debt obliges the central bank in Frankfurt to do nothing about the current, more than tense situation on the European bond markets, in order not to provoke their deterioration.
The political costs would be far too high.
The French finance minister Christine Lagarde welcomed yesterday at a press conference the active role taken by the ECB in resolving European public debt.
It did not dare to say whether it considered that the central bank could do even more, for example by mobilising its programme of purchases of government bonds.
"I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...)".
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, on the day before his hearing in Brussels by the Economic and Monetary Committee of the European Parliament, did not very much speak about his project, but rather expressed satisfaction at the fact that the programme of buying state papers on the secondary market would be "further active" and that at the meeting on Thursday we would "see how the decisions will turn out".
The only certainty: the ECB will remain its key interest rate unchanged at 1%, the most historically low level since May 2009.
In practice, last week’s treasury bonds were doubled to approximately EUR 1.35 billion.
And according to the indiscretions of some traders, she was supposed to have made new purchases on Irish and Portuguese government papers yesterday.
The Eurosystem’s central banks have made purchases of 67 billion euros since May 2010.
In any case, there is no doubt among the dealers that anticipation of a follow-up to the purchase price is questioned (see page 29).
The economists do not expect a remarkable change in price.
If the bond operations are already disappearing from the ECB's arsenal of over three months, the latter will be able to create free reserves of funds in an unlimited manner, for a period of up to three months.
Today, the economists are already aware of the fact that this measure will be extended by a few months.
"I cannot imagine the ECB changing its programme in a substantial way".
"Otherwise, she would take the risk of creating new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, the economist of Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit scheduled for the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," Norbert Bräms, the economist at Sal, anticipates.
Oppenheim.
In the field of their intervention on the sovereign debt market, "the ECB would have to maintain such a volume of purchase of bonds that would revive the lucrative market," adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the markets of sovereign debt in the euro area, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must enter the market at any price and act in such a way as to prevent the rapid enthusiasm for the returns paid to the weakest states," testified an important bondholder yesterday.
For if interest rates were to start to rise, states would be even more prevented from reducing their debt or only stabilising them.
This is the price to protect the euro.
Berlusconi Government goes to cover in Italy
After a week's alarming beginning for Italy yesterday, the situation with the decline in interest rates to 10 years has relaxed a little.
A return to the deceitful silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs, regional chairman Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as "indispensable" and had expected him to have heard a "unforeseeable" weekend, which the person demented immediately.
At least on Tuesday, with the German interest rates, the scissor would have reached its record of 210 basis points, and the prices of the bankruptcy risk-covered contracts had risen to 263 points, which had caused some headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out to his Council of Ministers that Spain's discrepancy with German interest rates was 400 basis points.
His right hand, Gianni Letta, however, had expressed itself as being "severely concerned" about the "market turbulence" and a possible risk of contamination from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
It is clear that his problem is the absence of economic growth and the associated, dwindling tax revenues that threaten the state to no longer cover its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, Italian growth is expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the budget is expected to be 1.3% or 2% in the Senate for review.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the budget deficit will amount to 4.3% of GDP next year (compared with the 3.9%) forecast by governments and 3.5% in 2012 (compared to 2.7%).
Therefore, the uproar of a new budget collective, which could be spent on 7 billion euros after the holidays.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken", says auditors Olli Rehn.
Currently, Italy receives the support of international institutions.
"The fundamentals of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, which we have been repeating for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who is entrusted with Italy's IMF.
"At the moment there are no problems, neither in the short term nor in the long term, as, despite Italy's high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A. d. R.), less stabilisation progress is required than by other countries," observed Pier Carlo Padoan, head of the OECD.
Keep the question of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will be faced with a motion of censure by the Chamber of Deputies, which could be organised by the end of March.
So there is a slight favourable period for a decision-making period with regard to a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on the expansion of anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde had pointed it out yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I think it has been proved on Sunday afternoon and evening: the Europeans clearly hold together, are willing and committed to defend their currency and their currency area".
Although totally relative - the last recorded deduction from the interest rates of European government bonds was water on the mills of governments and the ECB.
However, it is not yet possible to speak of normalisation.
The Standard & Poor's rating agency had announced that it could reduce Portugal's debt record, the probably most effective target of the speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility that is particularly burdened on banking systems," said the economists of the Exane BNP Paribas.
Above all, especially "political time passes much slower than markets".
The European countries, which are well aware of both this gap and the danger it poses, are intensifying discussions on strengthening the existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal discussions between the most directly concerned finance ministers and in the wider sense with their counterparts to the G20 are progressing well.
This also applies to Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
The plan includes the lot of unconventional measures to strengthen the backbone of the eurozone countries in the cross-border market (see below).
As far as the EU Stability Fund is concerned, its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, has already started its Asia tour on Tuesday in Singapore to inform investors in the Far East about developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of his visit is not explicit fundraising, he will certainly prepare the terrain for this.
The first investment expenditure on the EU Stability Fund will be scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official American representative of the Reuters Agency had entrusted the United States with support of a possible increase in the funds mobilised by the additional direct commitment of the IMF.
Portugal and Spain, first of all countries, are calling for structural reforms, especially in the area of labour market organization.
Reforms, which are added to the austerity measures, should, however, show effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid are going a different way than Greece and Ireland have done.
Both the one and the other are at every price to avoid having to ask for international assistance before they have set up their own budget corrections and decided on essential structural reforms that will bring them back their confidence on a permanent basis.
In turn, European investors are talking about the options available to speed up the normalisation process of the markets of government bonds.
Axel Weber, who was on the crossing in Paris on 24 November, had first brought the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to intervene again in its own pocket.
The economists of Barclays Capital, with regard to the market of European sovereign debt in the foreground, judge that an extension of around 100 billion euros would suffice, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This means: the European mechanism of financial stabilisation, which currently amounts to EUR 60 billion.
An advisory board, which has all the opportunities to be carefully examined in the European capitals.
Above all, when market conditions escalate.
Snow and Glatteis: 24 Departments in Alert Orange
The snow episodes are still experiencing traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary transport networks of Brittany and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in Orange alarm mode due to the threat of snow and slippery risks.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have been added to the 20 departments already in Orange alarm stage; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later at night.
According to Météo France, the intense snowshoes tang the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it snows slightly on the et Ile-de-France.
In the departments concerned, snow blankets of 2 to 5 cm are expected, sometimes from 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin regions.
The snowfalls are remarkable enough to cause traffic congestion and to affect certain economic activities, says Météo France.
In the region of Côtes d'Armor, several regional roads are blocked for heavy traffic of over 7.5 tons, including the road axis Guingamp Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The traffic situation of the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the traffic police who advise against using their own vehicle only in an emergency, and the use of some TER buses has been cancelled throughout the day.
In the Picardie school traffic was cancelled for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were provided for in the case of heavy goods vehicles on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "demands drivers to be extremely careful on the streets and to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) called on airlines to cancel 25% of their flights from Roissy Paris Airport and 10% of their flights from Orly due to the expected heavy snowfalls.
DGAB recommends that passengers contact their airline.
The Gatwick airports in southern London and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport sector at Ile-de-France has been in full swing, it has been raining billions.
At least in the discussions.
The 23 billion for the Grand Paris Metro to be built by the Société du Grand Paris is recalled in particular.
In order to guide the start of the construction of the SGP, the state has called for a capital donation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that the SGP would then allow to allocate to the markets part of the financial amount in its dual form.
Today, the first bills have finally come to light.
The 2010 supplementary budget, which was reviewed this morning by the National Assembly Financial Commission, contains the measures provided for in order to raise the first part of this money.
These measures are twofold: the creation of a special tax on the development and taxation of offices in Ile-de France.
The former, according to Article 15 of the draft law, goes "in favour of the public-law institution Société du Grand Paris".
This is calculated as follows: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year".
The second is a reorganization of the existing corporate tax system: "to modernise it in order to increase its output and to overtake this increase in the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring?
A mystery.
This sum is not calculated in the text.
Of the 4 billion, you're far away.
"It is stated that the tax resources are added to the EUR 4 billion of the capital allocation that the State will make and the Société du Grand Paris will gradually be made available for the project", the explanatory statement is given.
This system is not at all offensive to the SGP.
"Since the moment when income is recorded (the two taxes, i.e. R.), you can cover the projectation over three years and then only draw from the 4 billion," it is explained.
"This will be recorded in the budget and gradually reduced".
The SGP estimates that 2013 will start to record the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, which has been promised for four billion years, is in danger of creating a properly motivated parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Racist Hackers and Negligent Spions
The Affaire WikiLeaks has a double meaning.
On one side it has emerged as an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal in the sense of hypocrisy that governs relations between the states, the citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level and gives a premonition to the future dominated by aggression.
But let's move on to the line.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each file created by a intelligence service (an x-any nation) consists exclusively of newspaper excerpts.
The "extraordinary", American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconis throw away nothing more than what one could read for months anyway in every x-any journal (except those whose owners are Berlusconi), and the frightening caricatured profile of Gaddafi has been offering cabaret artists material for their sketches for a long time.
The rule, according to which the secret files must consist only of news already known, is essential to the dynamics of secret services, and that is not only this century.
When you go to a library dedicated to esotherical publications, you will realize that every work (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templar or the Rose Crusades) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not the only reason why the author wants to publish non-cultural texts (yet he does not know where to find news about the non-existent) but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe in nothing other than what they already know and confirm what they have learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
And the secret records.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited spirit) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise, he could be whatever, for example, editor at Libération), who only considers what he acknowledges.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi, which the American Embassy had sent to the state department in Rome, was the same as those that Newsweek had published the week before.
Why, then, was such a lifting around the revelations of this file?
On one hand, they say what every educated person already knows, namely that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then also the Heads of Government can call each other or take an airplane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some small representation tasks, have turned into spy centers.
Every viewer of investigation films knows this very accurately, and it does not happen from hypocrisy that one does so to ignore it.
Nevertheless, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second, the idea that an x-any hacker can pick up the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a huge blow to the prestige of the state department.
In addition, the scandal brings less victims than the "hard-hearted" ones into trouble.
But we are dedicated to the profound nature of what has happened.
Once, at Orwell's time, one could bundle all power like a big brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy could have been perfectly correct since then, where one can control any movement thanks to the telephone, any transaction done, the hotel visited, the chosen highway and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But if one is to face what is happening today that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, then the control procedure ceases to be one-sided and becomes circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the citizen's revenger - can reveal the secrets of power.
But how can a power no longer be able to keep its own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character Berlusconis or Merkels is basically a secret free of mystery, as it reveals the public sphere; but in WikiLeaks' style to reveal that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, means to rob them of any power.
WikiLeaks did neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this offense caused by such a powerful power?
It is obvious that no more reserved information will be made available online by the states in the future - that would be the same as a hanging on the street corner.
But it is equally obvious that it is in vain with current technologies to hope to keep confidential reports on the telephone.
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a head of state moved in a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private relations be maintained in the future and only for certain ears?
I know very well that at the moment my prediction sounds like science fiction and romantic, but I see it necessary to introduce myself to the government authorities, moving secretly on uncontrollable routes, carrying their communications with them nowhere but in mere memory, and, furthermore, hiding the few written information they have received in the shoe market.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed drawers: basically, the spying attempt by Watergate had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology is now progressing like a cancer, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructed a telegraph with (telephonic) wire.
The (analogues) video cassettes had enabled the film researchers to explore a film tape for tape by flushing from the back to the front and opening all the secrets of the assembly, while the (numerical) CDs nowadays do not allow anything but jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macro portions.
The high-speed trains take you from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this requires three and a half hours by plane, including the transfer.
It is therefore not unusual for politics and communication technology to return to car and horse.
One last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what was forged by secrets between the messages.
At present, it is the messages that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France speaks well of its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine compliance with the quickly resolved financing promises (also called "Fast Start" or early financings) implemented by the developing countries.
And already the coarse French fine speeches are uncovered.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have committed themselves to providing 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. EUR 420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of COP16, the EU has drawn all the registers to convince its partners of the fact that they are committed to the fast-start financing: detailed progress report of their Member States, press conference, major side events, brochure distribution.
Operation Transparency is remarkable and is highly valued for its real value: developing countries and civil society would like to see all developed countries do the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announces its release of EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, bringing it on the right path towards respecting its commitment of EUR 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if you look into the details, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional use has been made, without harming public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark he considers to be the best.
For example, the EU Commission has identified itself as the benchmark for 2009: international funding will be maintained and 150 million will be allocated over three years as part of the "Fast start" funding.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks, either year-on-year or state-of-the-art.
In return, France considered that the funding of "all new projects" in 2010 was "new and additional".
In other words, there are no benchmarks for spending in the previous year or at global level on public development aid.
To put it specifically, the total amount of French aid to developing countries can remain stable (or even decreasing) - France provides for its commitment to "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the breakdown into donations and loans.
There is no rule about this, and everyone chooses its calculation mode.
Some, such as France, are 1 loaned € as equivalent to 1 donated €.
Obviously, this is only hard to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain profitable investments (which are often linked to emission control projects based on the most effective technology), it is deceptive to present the euro that is collected as an equivalent for a donated euro... In addition, only the cost of the loan for the donor country should be counted as a commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing but the following considerations: it "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million by taking in 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and donating 8.5%) - see also the EU document to convince itself of it.
France is the only country in the EU to use loans to a large extent.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (among other things) assume 100% of their commitments with donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends EUR 1 to fulfil its commitments, France only gives 10 cents and understands a comparable use.
Nice Hokuspokus!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double dizziness: partly with a further development of the action over time and partly with the reality of the financial effort.
France manages to believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" millions in accordance with its promises and saves 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative effect; once EU-internal (why do the other Member States continue to donate, if it is sufficient to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not completely deceived...
The chapter of pre-financing is only a small question in a relatively short time compared to the whole of discussions on the climate.
But it could be too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
Whatever the case, it is essential to learn its lesson from this first year of financing.
First of all, France could announce a change in its way of accounting for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and equalisation with the other countries of the European Union.
In particular, France could raise the issue of the subject matter of long-term financing (another topic that is crucial and currently discussed): it does not escape the question of the "replicability" or the type of booking of its loans.
France could change its position in order to be as progressive on the issues as it is on other matters.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister of the Environment, Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement about the fast start of France and its vision of "prudence" as well as the use of loans would naturally lift from the international trust base which is necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - Pesticides taken by children
A child of 10 years takes on various chemical substances over the day 81, so a study published this Wednesday by the association Générations Futures (former movement to protect the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which explains that its results "in view of the small number of samples analysed do not reflect a statistically significant value, but represent an illustration character of the problems treated", had bought the food in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris between July and September, usually within four, consumed by a child about ten years at meals, plus an intermediate meal.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day - have been investigated as well as nasal laboratories looking for chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The counter balance sheet is low: 81 chemical substances, including 42 classified as potentially or probably carcinogenic and five classified as safe caricogens, as well as 37 substances with endocrine disruptive factors, according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if the legal limits for each chemical, individually consumed substance are not exceeded in the almost total case, this survey is very well taken out that the reality, in which the consumer may be exposed to carcinogenic substances or substances with endocrine disruptors, is a cause for concern," says the association.
During breakfast alone the butter and tea with milk already contain more than ten of the possibly carcinogenic residues and three proved safe as carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues which may affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, as an interim period for the study, has traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya included in lunch, where the study found traces of an insecticide strictly prohibited in the EU.
Furthermore, the hack steak, the tuna from the bush, even the baguette and gum of pesticides and other chemical substances were spilt.
The analyses have revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform in the tap water.
At dinner the salmon steak with 34 identified chemical residues at the "richest" level, and even the plastic plate used to warm up the meal in the microwave was not uncontaminated.
The final risk of this "harmful cocktail" for consumers is "probably underestimated", says the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV) has proposed to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop the "increasing of civil diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) on the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals, was identified.
