Gutach: Even more security for pedestrians
They are not 100 meters away from each other: on Tuesday, the new B 33-foot ramp at the village parking lot has been put into operation in Gutach - in view of the older town hall.
Two plants so close to each other: intention or patronage?
Gutach's mayor answered this question clearly yesterday.
"The town hall lamp was installed at that time because it secures the school path," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser Ampel secure both cyclists and bus guests and the Bergle residents.
The plant officially commissioned yesterday was important for the crossing area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, spa park, bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area ›Grub‹.
"At the high traffic and pedestrian turnout, another light had to come to their safety," Eckert said.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of the Landratsamt Offenburg.
"Only current measurements run on the B 33 every day about 12,000 vehicles the municipality of Gutach, of which about ten percent are heavy load traffic," says Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of another traffic light would be more than necessary: "Security is simply going on here," says Arnold.
A total of four traffic shows had been carried out, but a roundabout was also thought of, but due to the narrowness in the crossing area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße was rejected again.
According to Arnold, everything has been tested before in the selection of the traffic lights: "We have tested whether these vehicles can be driven off the Sulzbach road to the B 33 without turning around the traffic lights with particularly long wooden poles loaded transporters."
The approximately 15 000 Euro traffic light plant itself is the "most modern one in the market," Arnold explained.
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs, which are so bright that the lights of the motorists can be well recognized, for example, even at the depth of the sun.
And it is also economical: the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: This is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian presses the traffic lights, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic position.
If the road is clear, immediately green comes for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be completed for the pedestrian.
"If a group or disabled people go over the street, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will be safe on the road," Arnold explained.
Of course, the car driver had to think here as a partner and watch the road.
This was not the case yesterday: the traffic lights for pedestrians showed little green, a top-class vehicle sprung through - with bright red.
Josef Winkler has been writing about his childhood and youth for more than 30 years.
The catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the languagelessness, the fad of raw violence and blunt sexuality, the narrowness and joylessness - have often described the Carinthian poet.
The Büchner award winner is known mainly as a prose author, theatre texts are rare in his work.
Collage from Prosatexten Gerhard Fresacher for his performance "Wetterleuchten auf der Zungenspitze", which can now be seen in the Garage X at Petersplatz, therefore a collage from prosatexten.
The theatremaker combines elements from the autobiographical novel "Der Leibeigene" (1987) with prosaminatures from "Leichnam, his family belauerend" (2003).
On the largely empty-spaced stage - important prop: a crooked sofa, on which the impression is coupled and masturbated - the eight-headed ensemble hangs through the text material.
Director Freacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance convinces the template with a wealth of directorships, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic game forms.
Above all, the actresses are involved in the sometimes questionable scenic implementations.
They are touched hard, dipped under water with their heads, nailed to the wall with their evening seals.
Enforced in Zellophan or Mieder, they stick on dangerously high poles through the stage, either monologue them loudly or lie completely stunned on the stage floor.
However, the text hardly conveys itself in this strenuous way.
The best moments have the evening when sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to popular songs.
Only towards the end does the overcrowded performance come to rest, and Winkler's aftergone absurd humor flashes up.
A blackbox in the car?
US road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying Highway system, and believe to have found the solution in a small black box, which takes place on the dashboard of each car.
The devices that record every mile and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the planning offices of the states to revise the obsolete system of financing US roads.
The usually boring area of road planning has suddenly triggered an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups and advocated that the government use the small boxes to record the driven kilometers – and possibly where they were driven – and then use the information for the calculation of tax documents.
The tea party is horrified.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
But while Congress cannot agree on a procedure, several states no longer wait.
They are currently considering how, over the next ten years, they will be able to switch to a system where drivers pay per mile driven.
Thousands of motorists have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a must for our country.
"It's nothing we can only use," said Hasan Ikhrata, Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plans to record the miles in all California car drivers in the state from 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for this is here.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed from the taxes paid by US Americans on the Zapfs column, is pleading.
But in America not as much is being thought of as before.
Cars consume less gasoline.
The state mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 cents per litre) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax even for a cent at high prices.
"The petrol tax is simply not sustainable", says Lee Munnich, an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system.
"This is the most meaningful alternative in the long term," he said.
Bureaucrats call it a mile-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is heard by urban liberals, for for example, the tax could be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to reduce congestion and harmful exhaust gases.
The California planners rely on the system to develop strategies to achieve the ambitious, legally anchored goals of the state on climate change.
However, Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, Chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he sees in it the most common long-term alternative.
The Reason Foundation's free marketers are also given the idea of having drivers pay by distance travelled.
"This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole," explains Adrian Moore, Vice President for Reason's Guidelines.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former US transport ministers, who in a 2011 report asked the Congress to move towards mile-based accounting.
Last year the US Senate approved a $90 million expensive pilot project that would have included 10,000 cars.
However, the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the initiative and thus responded to the concerns of representatives from rural areas who often have to spend many miles on their way to work or to the city in everyday life.
Several states and large cities are still moving in this direction on their own.
The most committed is Oregon, which currently employs 5,000 drivers for the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the miles instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City also considers such a thing.
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 Coalition, which includes the Transport Ministries of 17 states on the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently investigating how the change could be introduced.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment, drivers were sceptical about the idea that the government could pursue each of their movements.
"Threats against Big Brother and such things were a big problem," explains Alauddin Khan, Head of Strategy and Results Management at the Nevada Ministry of Transport.
People didn't want it.
When the test was carried out, Nevada’s ACLU warned: “It would be relatively easy to turn the tachographs into adult surveillance devices.”
There is no need to build a huge, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to capture data about the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that now look for affordable technology with which the state can detect the driven kilometers, but not exactly when and where.
Thus, according to Khan, the public would also be calmer.
The pursuit of this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company has originally not started to help states in taxing motorists.
Rather, it was their goal to take a foothold in an emerging market for car insurance, in which drivers are to pay on the basis of the miles driven.
However, the devices tested by them are also interesting for road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide limited information that are regularly uploaded via modem.
"People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded," explained Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
Some of these public pilot programmes have made great mistakes.
There are considerably cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon the planners experiment with giving drivers a number of selection options.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they do not choose any equipment at all and instead pay a flat-rate fee on the basis of the average miles driven by all the inhabitants of the state.
Other places hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more functions than with fewer.
In New York City traffic officials want to develop a taxing device that also pays parking fees, an insurance only has to be paid for driven kilometres and speed data is collected from other vehicles in real time, thanks to which drivers can avoid traffic jams.
"Autodrivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system," says a city planning document.
However, some traffic planners wonder whether the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials explained that the Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by increasing fuel tax.
An additional one-off charge or an annual charge could be imposed on hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol, so that they too pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient," explains Randy Rentschler, the head of the Commission's legislation and public affairs.
When we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers worry about their privacy and many other things.
Königsfeld: Little team beats up waker
The volunteer fire brigade managed its autumn main test despite staff shortages with bravour.
Only eleven men participated in the exercise.
Department Commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the estate Feder on Burgberger Straße in his exercise.
There should have been a short cut in sawing.
Two people were injured by the resulting fire and smoke development, but one of them could send an emergency call.
After the first examination of the situation by Hans Kammerer, two ventilators of the Wehr made themselves available to enter the building.
After a short time it was possible to find the first person and lead him into the open.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy, as it was also a narrow staircase to overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stable for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood and strawballs in it.
There were also electric machines for woodworking.
The first fire attack took place over the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was carried out via an overfloor hydrants about 100 meters away.
Now three deletion attacks could be designed.
A hollow beam tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer was also concerned with showing what is to be done with little staff available.
In serious cases, support is given via the Königsfeld daily deployment group.
The commander was satisfied with the conduct of the exercise.
Networking universities and companies important
During his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, Landtag President Guido Wolf also made it clear in Titisee-Neustadt about where the workers of tomorrow came from.
In the funding centre Hochschwarzwald he studied this important question together with the business leaders of the professional schools as well as the circuit gymnasium and the chairperson of the parents' council.
"Education is an important location factor," underlined Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma school, who presented the networked school project Education Centre Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011 there has been successful cooperation in the forest city between the funding centre, the district school and the vocational school centre.
He also praised family kindness in the district.
"It is important not only to have a view of the family phase, but also the stage for the care of relatives due to demographic change," Wolf explained.
He also said that more and more employees were concerned with the care and care of their family members.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship," Wolf said.
But no one could afford to lose qualified workers, he continued.
Another, particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"Because those who have already learned the advantages of the region during their studies often retain their knowledge and skills in the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," said the President of the Landtag.
Only if sufficient training places were offered can the need for skilled workers be met.
In his opinion, the location advantage of the district is its favourable location in the southwest of Germany, close to France and Switzerland.
On his train from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he also experienced the efforts already made to expand public transport.
"Stay firm and ensure that public transport improves," he explained at the address of the local politicians present.
A entertaining afternoon with music
For 15 years the Kaul family has invited the Dieting Seniors to coffee, cake and then to a Vesper.
In the early days, the elderly were hired in the restroom.
In the meantime, this afternoon the nursing home of St. Josef takes place.
The residents were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later, there was sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father, Karl Kimmich, were part of the band with regular melodies.
The over 100-year-old natural stone wall as a pre-delimitation of the pre-refurbishment old school yard to Kirchstraße is to be put on the refurbishment cost plan of the city of Brönlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig a small corner wall was installed during the first works of the renovation of the front school yard, for stabilizing and static relief of the over one hundred years old natural stone wall with balustrade.
Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt, says that the Landesdenkmalamt is involved in the planning and that it is planned to create a refurbishment concept for the old wall.
A cost calculation is then to be carried out by experts, who are then to be placed on the table to the council for decision and further action.
A decision on this is expected to be taken in the coming year.
After the renovation, planting and planting of the old school courtyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, it is necessary, in due course, as a follow-up measure, to refurbish the need for refurbishment of the walls and to put them on new underframes.
The historic wall of the old schoolyard to Kirchstraße, one hundred years old, is mainly damaged by water and frost, since there is no drainage, needs renovation and has a bowing forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones are evidence of weather damage, but the wall is currently not at risk of collapse.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for a school yard used by students, which has been done by the current fortification work.
The school courtyard renovation was originally planned even in 2008/2009, but high unplanned spending brought about a shift.
An important word in the historical school wall renovation, which was even used for film shoots, will be spoken by the Landesdenkmalamt.
If regulations come from this side, then the city of Brönlingen hopes for subsidies from the monumentists.
The students of the Bräunlinger primary school, who are now taught again in a well renovated old school building with new aula, can soon use the old school yard.
Özdemir wants to receive jazz education in Stuttgart
In the ongoing discussions on the future of the music universities in Baden-Württemberg, Cem Özdemir, Federal President of the Greens, has now joined in.
"I think it is wrong to give up the holistic training at the Stuttgart Musikhochschule," Özdemir said the "Stuttgarter Nachrichten".
Jazz and classical music belong at the jazz location Stuttgart.
This contradicts Özdemir, who in Stuttgart is considered a favourite for a direct mandate in the Bundestag election on 22 September, the Green-Red Landesregierung.
On the basis of an expert study, this forces a new order of the five music universities in Baden-Württemberg.
After that, Jazz and Pop will be transferred from the Stuttgart Musikhochschule to the Mannheim Musikhochschule.
U.S. border: "Super tunnel" discovered to be a drug smuggler
At the border between Mexico and the United States, investigators discovered and shut down a "super tunnel" for drug smuggling.
As reported by the US customs authorities, the more than 500 meter long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railway tracks and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were then arrested, eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine seized.
The tunnel had not yet been used.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig themselves under the radar," said the U.S. U.S. South California Attorney General Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a San Diego warehouse where this was discovered at the end of the tunnel.
Duffy turned to the drug gangs assured: "If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against the drug cartel.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Constructed by experts
Because of the elaborate equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took place for about a year.
The track system was so equipped that electrically operated cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, the entrance is located in a building 80 metres from the border.
According to the authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters deep to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross section of 1.20 meters height and 90 centimeter width.
It would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the United States.
Two suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine find.
The third, a Mexican, was captured because of the seizure of marijuana.
All three are threatened with maximum punishment for lifelong deprivation of liberty, as officials said.
Since 2006 eight such tunnels have been discovered, it continued at the press conference in San Diego.
But it was the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel construction.
Cocaine is usually smuggled in smaller amounts and not through tunnels.
This shows the "desperation" of the drug gangs whose traditional routes are now cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA drug trap in San Diego.
They would do anything to get to the United States.
No details were given to the prisoners, at least one was Mexican, it was said.
You have to expect prison sentences for up to ten years.
2014 will Geisinger
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
The return of the first documentary mention is drawing ever closer.
When the year comes to an end in about eight weeks, the anniversary year begins.
Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen were first mentioned together in the documentary.
In churches, a certificate was produced in which both places are mentioned.
On March 15th there will be an official start to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this start-up event will take place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in Kirchen-Hausen.
During the anniversary several events are planned in Geisingen, as well as in Kirchen-Hausen.
The church houses will be 1250 in July on a weekend of July 18 to 20.
Celebrate again.
On Friday with a ceremony, on Saturday and Sunday with a party around the Kirchtalhalle.
This weekend is also the church-housen festival.
City Music Director Rudolf Barth has written for the city on the occasion of the anniversary an order composition which is listed on three dates.
On 21 June together with the Sunday celebration of the Schwarzwaldverein, on 12 July in the Arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of city music in the new festival hall.
This will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date is on the last week of September, on 27 and 28 September.
A new chronicle will also be released on the occasion of the Geisinger City Jubilee.
"But it should be a chronicle not only of Geisingen itself, but of today's geising, which consists of Geisingen, Kirchen-Hausen, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," says Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And also today's Geisingen celebrates 2014 birthday, 1974 the present-day space was carried out with the congregations.
The new chronicle will then be presented on 21 or 22 November at the new festival hall in Geisingen.
2014 is also a year with many jubilees.
The Naarrenzuft Strohglonki begins on February 8 with a wedding evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the harmony Gutmadingen will be 90 years old and has the feast on March 29th and then celebrates the District Music Festival from May 1 to 4.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen is 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen is 150 years old and celebrates this in the framework of the Brunnenfest from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a certificate of gift, which is owned by the monastery of St. Gallen, in 764.
The certificate was produced in churches (houses), which was a court of law at the time.
Both municipalities are thus mentioned in the same document.
Reason to celebrate 2014 this 1250-year-old accordingly, in addition, the community reform is also 40 years ago.
Council takes a look at railway tracks
Should the railway crossing "Am Hirschen" be extensively rebuilt in order to increase road safety?
Yes, the municipal councils have decided.
Schiltach must take over 220 000 euros.
The Deutsche Bahn plans to improve the Kinzig Valley track next year.
In particular, the safety of rail crossings is to be increased - on a regular basis, collisions of trains with other vehicles occur across the country.
If the municipalities agree to the conversion measures, they must participate with a third in the costs, the rest in terms of the train and the federal government.
Schiltachs Stadtbaumeister Roland Grießhaber explained to the council the characteristics of the Bah crossing "Am Hirschen".
There, at the height of the tunnel mouth to the west of the railway tracks, the city plans to make a reservation.
Larger vehicles, such as those transporting longwood, could also be present in counter-traffic traffic without having to block the tracks.
Greßhaber therefore proposed to construct a necessary supporting wall in such a way that the city could spread the subsequent road in due time to ensure a smooth traffic flow.
This was discussed in the council, as some councils questioned the need for road traffic: Thomas Kipp, with his statement, pointed out the opinion of the critics: "Do we have to take so much money into our hands because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted: The railway crossing "Hirschen" was regularly used for long-range wood transports.
Even wood from the area "Kuhbach" was partly transported over this route because the vehicles up to 20 metres long could not use the route on the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn into the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a redirection for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is blocked, Haas argued.
Since Kirchberg and Schlossbergtunnel would have to be rebuilt and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing "Am "Hirschen" could also have an important transport impact for a longer period of time.
The Councils agreed to examine the costs of the planned road distribution.
Despite this, the conversion of the railway crossing was agreed by majority with the condition that the necessary supporting wall is built in such a way that the city could extend the subsequent road direction "Bahnhofstraße" for meeting traffic to about 5.5 meters, if necessary.
The conversion of the train crossing at the Gerberei Trautwein could, on the other hand, entail a very different problem with regard to access to the "Geroltzhäuser Weg".
The administration had the railway conversion plans examined by Breinlinger's engineering office, as it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhaus Weg was possible without further delay.
The investigation concluded that it was not excluded that the inclination conditions of the road could lead to longer vehicles being fitted.
In turn, the city was responsible for this.
The conversion could therefore lead to liability disputes.
Since both the logging and the turning-off worked in the current state of expansion, Haas argued that the conversion of the crossing should not be accepted.
At this point too, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle on the transition was significantly lower than that of the other crossings, because it was directly adjacent to the centre of the stop to which there was a good visual connection.
Even trains from the main station should have been slowed down to the point where no collision threatens.
The majority of the amendments to this railway crossing were rejected as the city of Schiltach had to "spoil out" the problem with seated vehicles, according to the councils, since after completion of the construction work the railway could withdraw from the responsibility.
The Board considers the conversions to the railway crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach" for which crossing agreements with the railway have already been reached.
Esa decides on large space missions: missions for billions
Remote planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to start over the next few years.
30 proposals were available, five are still in the race.
Far worlds.
Astronomers have already found more than 1000 planets in other stars.
Whether or not there are some of them lives, nobody knows.
The selection is difficult: Should you search for gravitational waves?
Or do you prefer to explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or after similar planets and perhaps discover extraterrestrial life?
These questions are precisely the responsibility of the European Space Agency, Esa.
For their program "Cosmic Vision", they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are intended to bring research forward decisively.
The budget for such "L-missions" is approximately one billion euros each.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
In early September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
There were 30 ideas in the debate, five of which have now come to a close.
Numerous bodies examine the proposals, check with the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee.
The Esa has selected a total of four major questions to which the missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme launched in 2007 will find answers.
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and life?
The exact processes of the formation of stars from great gas clouds - and hence the formation of planets that surround these stars - are still in the proverbial darkness.
A large infrared telescope in the universe could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
In order to address this issue, the Space Telescope "Cheops" will be launched in 2017, with which 500 already known planetary systems will be studied more closely in our vicinity.
The possibilities are limited, however, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could depict earthlike planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and thus search for "biomarkers": gases that are considered an indicator of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question should also ultimately reveal what conditions exist for the emergence of life.
An important role is the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation from it with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be investigated exemplaryly.
With the "Solar Orbiter", the Esa has already approved a mission of the M-Class (there the budget is about half a billion euros) for this issue.
The probe will start in 2017 and observe the surface and activity of the sun.
Of great interest to the researchers are Jupiter and his moons.
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system.
To this end, the Esa foresees the first of the three L-missions of the "Cosmic Vision" program.
The Juice (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) probe is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, it reaches Jupiter and is designed to explore the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to investigate whether the laws of nature known to us are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also some deviations that might lead the physicists to a new theory under which all known laws of nature can be unified.
How did the universe come into existence and what does it consist of?
13.7 billion years ago our cosmos was created by the Big Bang.
Besides common matter, consisting of stars, planets, and living beings like us, there are dark matter, whose gravity holds up galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and dark energy, through which the expansion of the universe accelerates.
So far, the researchers do not know what physical laws were valid in the first parts of the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy are made up of.
With "Euclid", the Esa has already approved an M mission which is scheduled to start in 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is intended to investigate for the first time the distribution of matter in the universe in the entire sky and thus enable conclusions to be drawn on the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection procedure.
In the opinion of many experts, "E-Lisa", the best chances of being granted an L-Mission permit have a demanding concept for proofing waves of gravity.
Among these are physicists who understood changes in the structure of space time that Albert Einstein had predicted nearly 100 years ago.
They have not been proven to this day.
Elisa could do that, hope the scientists behind the project.
The mission provides a two or three probe detector stationed in space.
In contrast to earth’s systems, he could also prove waves of gravitational gravitation that emerged during the Big Bang, thus providing new insights into the origin of the Cosmos.
Four more proposals compete for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which is intended to explore black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which is intended to detect and investigate earth-like planets.
There are already some suggestions for the transfer of samples from Mars, the exploration of moon, Venus and asteroids, as well as solar physics.
Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany regarding US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the Whistleblower of the U.S. Secret Service, has declared that he is ready to travel to Berlin and announce before the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not give any answers about their activities.
The German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he received asylum to discuss the statement in Germany with him.
In a letter by Snowden, which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbele, she writes: "Even if the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat my opinion as a fidelity and tries to criminalise political opinion with impunity, where no defense is possible."
To tell the truth, however, is not a crime.
In the letter Snowden writes that he was convinced that the support of the international community could convince the American government to drop the charge against him.
The charges brought by the US Department of Justice include spying and theft of state property.
The German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said to time online: "If Mr. Snowden is willing to talk to German representatives, then we will find ways to make this possible."
The relations between the USA and Germany are burdened by the allegations that the NSA had intercepted the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, Member of the Parliamentary Committee responsible for secretarial services, said to take the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness, if this was possible, "without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the US".
Spröbele, a member of the Greens, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Schröbele explained that according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee Snowden could not return to Russia when he left the country.
If Snowden says in Germany, he needs assurance that he is "safe" there, says the honourable Member.
Snowden explains in his letter that he saw himself being subjected to a "serious and ongoing" persecution campaign that had driven him out of his homeland.
However, he was touched by the global reaction to 'my act of political opinion'.
Citizens around the world, as well as senior politicians – including in the United States – have identified the disclosures of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a merit for the general public.
In his letter, Snowden made an offer of cooperation to the German authorities, 'if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been solved'.
Frontier Airlines charges fees for hand baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to demand up to 100 US dollars from passengers who want to store hand baggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to 100 US dollars for a piece of hand baggage and 2 dollars for coffee or lemonade, even if the announcement on Wednesday announced that passengers should keep the whole can.
The new fee applies to hand baggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free of charge.
Frontier explained that if the fee was paid in advance, they would charge $25 and $100 for travellers who paid only on the flight path.
Frontier spokesman Kate O'Malley said that the fee of US$100 aims to move travelers, in advance to take care of the payment.
"We don't want to calculate this sum," she explained.
Airlines started in 2008 to charge fees for the first and second cancellations.
Passengers who tried to bypass them have therefore stuffed as much as possible in their hand luggage, which means that the luggage compartments above the seat are often overfilled.
Fees are an opportunity to move passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said at the new fee it wasn't really about making money.
It is about the most faithful clients from Frontier who would have clearly expressed that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the field above the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may be allowed to carry a piece of luggage free of charge at the front flight path, but the next person must pay 100 dollars for a comparable baggage.
O'Malley explained that the Frontier website and the check-in procedure would be changed so that passengers would be informed about the fee before they arrived at the airport.
Frontier's new hand luggage fee will only come into force in summer, there is no exact date yet.
Passengers are often ashamed of luggage surcharges and other charges, but airlines are happy to take advantage of them.
They argue that transporting luggage costs money and passengers should pay for this service if they wish.
Many on Wall Street regard the new baggage fees as a sign that airlines take enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most, however, have so far left the fingers of fees for hand baggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. claimed first hand baggage fees three years ago and later Allegiant Air, also a cheap flyer.
The only other airline with such a fee was the Hungarian Wizz Air, explained to Airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who followed the additional fees attentively.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the hand luggage fee Spirit will collect $50 million annually.
Sorensen, who previously held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with spirit and was curious about what would be expected on the flight path if passengers were faced with the company's unusual hand baggage fee.
"The boarding process was one of the most efficient I have experienced in my career in aviation," he said.
I was expecting to see toothpicks and hand-tip discussions on the flight path.
"The plane was full," he said, "and the boarding ran like lubricated."
Frontier also follows Spirit with the 2 dollars required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company explained that passengers who bought lemonade or juice should keep the whole can and fill coffee for free.
Water is still free of charge.
In 2008, US Airways had temporarily tried to demand money for refreshment drinks, but it did so again seven months later after passengers had complained and no other large company had moved.
Frontiers step, raising fees for hand baggage, if passengers do not buy directly from the airline, is the latest initiative with which customers should be directed to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per ticket sold.
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers to their direct purchase instead of via an online travel agency.
Frontiers have, however, gone the farthest in this area.
In September, the company began to award only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday the miles were reduced once again to 25 percent of the flight distance.
A third-party flight booked with Frontier over 1000 miles will therefore only deliver 250 miles to customers.
Passengers can also book places exclusively when buying directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver, but the business shrinks and the company loses money.
The proceeds went back by 9 percent and the flight capacity decreased by almost 13 percent in the first quarter, as can be read in the financial report published by the parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc. on Wednesday.
Republic has tried to control the finances of Frontier as part of the company's sale.
Spokeswords From the Bible
A good 40 women attended the last breakfast this year in the Evangelical church of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the town hall were "Words from the Bible" and "Languages from the Middle Ages".
Zita Köhler, the chairman of the church council, attended the Bible proverbs after breakfast.
"Words contain life wisdom, regulations or warnings," she explained.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding Bible passages and explained the meaning.
She called sayings like: Wooden eye be watchful, as the scales fall from the eyes, throw an eye on someone, the Lord gives him in sleep, wash his hands in innocence.
Several times the speaker also advised their listeners what the saying was.
The medieval sayings of the church church council Christel Dehner accepted: All good things are three, blue-making, something shrouded.
She explained the meaning and origin of the sayings she called "bridgeing to the past".
Finally, a tombola was released.
The prices were covered on a table and were humorously defined before they were handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors to the breakfast round, the mayor also mixed the candidate Roman Waizenegger.
Learning instead of unemployed: pilot project for unskilled in tourism
Today, a pilot project for the tourism industry is under way at the Mecklenburg Lakes Platette.
Under the direction of the Federal Employment Agency, 49 women and men who already work as unskilled workers in the industry are to be qualified for hotels and restaurants over three winters.
"The new thing is that the six-month courses end with degrees," said Carmen Wiechert of the Neubrandenburg Employment Agency.
The benefits were varied: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would get skilled professionals who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the Deutsche Hotel- und Gastättenverband (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are also involved in the project.
NSA explains that an “internal error” and not hacker is a fault in the crash of the website
The shady National Security Agency stated on late Friday that an error had paralyzed its public website for a few hours and not hackers, as was claimed online.
"NSA.gov was not available for several hours tonight because an internal error occurred during a scheduled update," explained the spy agency in an e-mail message.
The problem will be solved this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS) was not true.
In the early evening hours, online server trackers had noticed that the NSA website was not accessible for at least six hours and this is still not for some users.
Previously, a NSA spokesman had declared to ABC News that the sensitive internal network of the Authority was "in no way" compromised.
Secret information is not in danger, according to the speaker.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralysed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website is flooded with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
Cybertactic is relatively simple and attacks do not serve to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former super-secret NSA, whose nickname was once No Search Agency (no such authority), is now found in the bright light of the public and looks at the revelations that have become known in recent months about its extensive surveillance program in Germany and abroad – a result of the secret NSA data that was stolen and published by Edward Snowden, a disillusioned former NSA employee.
The growing controversy over secret services sparked initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyberoperation.
The number of people without a job is slightly decreased by 22 to 1,307 in October.
Although the rate is 3.1 percent better than last year and also better than in September, "we would have hoped for more," says Monika Feld-Bauer, Deputy Head of the Agency for Work in Sonthofen.
Many businesses have so far reacted to attitudes.
According to Feld-Bauer, one reason for this is: "We hardly have any skilled workers in the crafts sector, in the health sector and in the care of the elderly".
Since September, there have also been job offers for staff in the hotel and restaurant industry.
The winter season starts in mid-December.

Loss of profit in Bombardier after reduction in delivery numbers and orders
On Thursday, Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15-percent decline in net profit after being hit by reduced orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter as well as contract problems in the railway segment.
Bombardier based in Montreal also did not publish flight test data for his brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information as to whether the aircraft could be used for commercial purposes in accordance with the ambitious schedule in next September.
Up to now, only three additional launches followed on the pilot flight of the test aircraft, which makes it questionable whether the test phase is going as planned.
The results remained behind the forecasts and led to a fall of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, reduced his assessment of outperform to 'sector performance' with a view to having a limited price potential in the next one to two quarters.
"Although weaker delivery figures for aircraft have been expected as far as possible, we are clearly disappointed by the margin development in the transport sector," said Doerksen in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the aircraft test program progresses.
However, if no new orders will be announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series can catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.
But until now, binding orders for the CSeries with 177 are moderate, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see whether the company's claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings potential of the new jet aircraft are true.
Currently there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
Chairman of the Board Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach his goal of 300 binding orders at the start of commercial use of the jet.
Business management also insured against analysts and media on Thursday, the program is on schedule.
"The test aircraft was no longer on the ground," said Beaudoin at a telephone conference and added that during the aircraft's lifetime ground tests and software updates had been engaged.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We have decided to take a first flight and then attach a review period, whatever we have done.
This is happening throughout the flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks, the rest shortly after, it was called by the company.
Nevertheless, analysts remain sceptical about whether the first customer can operate a CSeries aircraft twelve months after the flight.
Bombardier said it was reviewing the planning for commissioning (EIS) and would update it in the next few months.
"The slow advance of the flight test – even if it is obviously in keeping with Bombardier's internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning is moving to the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter, at the end of September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to 147 million dollars or 8 cents per share of 172 million dollars or 9 cents per share in the previous year.
The adjusted earnings per share are unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenue was slightly down and decreased from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and sales of 4.56 billion dollars, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer states that he delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a drop of 57 in last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order stock in the aerospace sector amounted to 32.9 billion dollars on September 30th and was therefore unchanged on December 31st.
"In the field of aviation and space, the results were disappointing in our specifications, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
Revenue in the aerospace sector fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world’s largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this segment had risen by nearly eleven percent to 2.1 billion dollars.
The order stock in the transport division was $32.6 billion on September 30 and was slightly increased on December 31st.
The profit margin in transport has been affected by settlement problems in some major contracts.
According to corporate governance, there will be new guidelines for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trade on Thursday, the Bombardier share dropped 8.5 percent and was 4.83 Canadian dollars, after also announced that the Google Finance Director Patrick Pichette will change to the Board of Directors.
The Brazilian Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's narrowest rival, reported a 10 percent decline in quarterly profits on Thursday.
USA: Shots at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown has fired shots at the LAX airport on Friday morning (local time).
While the airport management informed Twitter that the shooter was in custody, the "Los Angeles Times" reported that the man was dead.
A security man had also been killed.
Media also reported several injuries.
US President Barack Obama was constantly informed about the situation, said White House spokesman Jay Carney.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3rd eyewitnesses said to have seen a shooter with a gun in one of the departure halls, as several media reported.
A traveler told the CNN station that many people had been panicking for protection.
Travelers would have shouted and children cried.
Among the waiting people panic broke out, many had hidden behind chairs for fear.
He heard two shots, says a traveler from the Los Angeles Times.
An employee of the TSA Security Authority suffered a gunshot at the foot.
The scene had been "like in a movie".
After that, he himself was taken to a security area, the man reported.
The shots should have fallen close to a security control area.
Airport building evacuated
There were TV footage showing the presence of numerous ambulances and police cars in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people have been taken out of the building.
Users published photos on Twitter of a Special Use Command and a gun lying on the ground.
As the airport management reported on Twitter, the incident started at 9.30 in the morning (local time).
The access roads were blocked, which, according to CNN, resulted in long backstations.
Until landings, air transport had been temporarily suspended, it said.
However, several planes on CNN were also observed at the start.
Terminal 3 is mainly operated by smaller US airlines.
Los Angeles Airport is the largest airport in the United States.
Cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned drug boss against police investigation has to go to prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided information on underworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction could come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpool Crown Court
A known criminal defender who warned a drug baron of a large police investigation because he was afraid of being exposed to his secret drug addiction was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, supplied Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about his activities in drug trafficking after he had been compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The first-class lawyer named "Bash" was arrested in his house in 2011 after the police had monitored Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous drug procedure.
Officials observed how Scarborough (32) delivered three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a dinner of the lawyer's chamber.
The investigations revealed that Ditta regularly consumed Class A drugs after testing traces of cocaine had been found in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were supervised by the police during a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were later arrested after the police secured a series of house searches worth 1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds of cash.
Ditta, 42, passed on information to the criminals because he was afraid that his drug addiction might become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for Blackburn's Forbes Solicitors, was found guilty and convicted at the Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial in two charges for obstructing justice.
He admitted the cocaine possession on a previous survey.
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out in their investigations against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw how he went to Ditta's house and put the drugs with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove under the garbage can of the lawyer.
Shortly after he delivered the drugs, Scarborough regularly telephoned Ditta, who was at dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, picked up the drugs, and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
In court, it became known that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after tests revealed drugs of Class A in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but refused to take cocaine and said that he had spoken to the suspected dealer because he was his client, claiming that her discussion was subject to the "secret of attorney".
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was taken.
In his police interrogation, he announced that he would run an office under his private address as well as at the workplace, and his clients would call him at home for legal matters.
It became known to the court that he had called and informed important actors in the drug trade, some of whom he had previously represented, of what the investigators knew about them.
State Attorney Anne Whyte said: "A criminal lawyer should know better than everyone else that you don't break the law."
Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a criminal defender, since he has too much time with certain clients.
The questionable relationship is not simply a drug dealer but a drug dealer who provides his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, for he was the lawyer of these people.
But this went far beyond the boundaries of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He countered police investigations as far as possible so that they could continue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta thus brought his profession to the fore.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta pointed out every misbehavior and said, "If I were a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and wanted to provide information to Scarborough, then I would not wait 15 hours, but do it immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: "Mr. Ditta has taken the step of a criminal defender when he started buying drugs from organized criminals."
His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organized crime who instructed him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public confidence and confidence.
Ditta has lost this confidence and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases because of the possession of cocaine and the impediment to justice, which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after declaring himself guilty of the conspiracy to trafficking heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five more people involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself in which he stated that his dream job was to represent as lawyer clients in the death cell in America, his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and opportunity inequality was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary work of church music
To conclude the celebrations on the occasion of his 160th anniversary, the Song Crane Dunningen will transform two divine services with the "German Mass" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which attracted the viewers in the spring of this year, the song wreath will enrich two divine services with the performance of the German fair by Franz Schubert at the end of the anniversary year.
On Saturday 26 October, this extraordinary exhibition will be held from 19th at the evening Mass in the St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday 27th October, from 10.15 p.m. to the divine service at the St. John Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called Deutsche Messe with its original title "Sings for the Celebration of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass", D 872, is a spiritual work of music by composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was almost considered revolutionary at the time of its creation.
The Mass is performed in the context of divine services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had it in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the brass group of the Musikverein Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Haslag: Skepticism deviates from obvious confidence
With the elections to the parishioner 2015, for example, Haslach (SE) will change fundamentally.
There is then only one common parishioner for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday the bodies from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
The diocese's fundamental decisions have nothing more to change and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
In the course of the day, it became particularly clear: the scepticism towards the New one, however, is hesitantly deviated from confidence.
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish, the extremely constructive discussions of the six bodies with the head office of the pastoral care team were extended.
The regional dean Georg Schmitt presented the new guidelines for pastoral care units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg.
After that, the SE Haslach, as a church community, will form a body of public law which enters into the rights and obligations of the so far six individual churches.
There will only be a joint parishioner and a foundation council in which the parish priest Kraft Office is represented.
At least two elected members from each parish are to be represented, six parishes forming local so-called community teams.
Their task will be to promote ecclesial life in the place in the future.
The question of the finances of the individual parishes then showed considerable need for discussion.
The innovations provide that accumulated assets will remain assigned to the parishes.
The liabilities, on the other hand, are transferred to the overall community.
Especially with regard to the large planned investments, whose commitment then all parishes meet, there was great concern.
"Even in the past only investments were made in projects that could be managed by the individual parishes alone," Haslach's parish chairman, Bruno Prinzbach, referred to.
Practical experience with a joint panel for five parishes described Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the board in the care unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
They had done their job in 2006, "one time, five days" and had to find that it was not that easy.
The bodies of the Haslacher Seelgemeinschaft then began to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish as well as the practical work of the community teams.
The drafts will be put into practice at further meetings and decided at a further joint meeting of all six bodies in the coming spring.
In the end, the parish priest Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the pastoral care unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf the electricity becomes more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorf must adjust to higher electricity costs.
As confirmed by the Managing Director of Stadtwerke, Jörg-Arne Bias, opposite the SÜDKURIER, a four-member Pfullendorfer family will receive 70 to 90 Euros of extra costs per year.
The rise in the so-called EEG conversion from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour is the main reason for the rise in prices.
This conversion is fixed by the four operators of the large electricity lines each October.
These figures are the additional costs arising from the energy transition, which they can raise through a conversion over the electricity price.
The Pfullendorf Municipal Works form the last link in this chain.
In his forecasts, the Energy Company's Supervisory Board even assumed a higher return, as reported by Jörg-Arne Bias.
Now the concrete payments would have to be calculated before the municipal works could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We're starting from an increase of 1 cent plus x," says Bias, where the number will be closer to the 2 cents.
Ampel on permanent red: keep on waiting
Sometimes a light just doesn't turn green.
The contact loop in the road does not react, or the light sign is defective.
What should you do then - drive by red?
If a victim has waited long enough for a red light and the crossing is free, he can continue, explains Stuttgart's lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting time had to be "reasonable", which could be interpreted differently on a case-by-case basis.
Becker advises to persist for at least five minutes before a functional impairment of the traffic lights has to occur.
Those who continue the journey despite the red light must be aware, however, that he is fully guilty of an accident caused by it.
Those who are less than five minutes of patience may not wait long enough, warns Becker and points to a decision of the Supreme Land Court Hamm.
In the negotiated case, after about three minutes of permanent red light, a driver had ignored the traffic lights and had to be responsible for a negligent red light breach.
The traffic lights were not defective, but turned to green a little later.
A driving ban was spared him because of the special situation - but the fine did not.
Municipal Council is looking forward to a solid household
Always when it comes to the household at municipal council meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The municipality sack in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and debts have not been known to the administration since 2005.
The 2012 financial year can also be regarded as a success in this sense.
This was made clear in the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of around 7.6 million euros was over EUR 1 million higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget is also around EUR 1.8 million above the approach.
As a result, the surplus was mainly higher commercial tax revenue and the municipal share in income tax.
Also, the asset budget was clearly above the planned values.
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million planned, it was EUR 2.5 million last year.
"This is mainly due to higher administration from the administrative budget," says Rothmund.
Since less investments have been made in the financial year 2012 than planned, the provision of reserves has also been higher.
Overall, the general reserve could be increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million now.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"Such a work is not simply shaken out of the sleeve," Gerster praised with regard to the annual accounts.
He and the municipal councils were pleased with the good figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but this very good figure could soon be more expensive for citizens.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality has in the past been able to dispense with high lifting rates.
However, according to Gerster, subsidies had been reduced several times by the country.
There are conditions for these grants from various levels of compensation.
Among other things, the cities and communities applying for grants must show certain lifting rates.
"We need to look at the issue of raising rates, since in the coming years there will be investments for which we like to have grants," Gerster announced in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter in the choir for 60 years
With 60 years as a singer, Hubert Wermter's story at the Men's Song Club Cecilia is almost twice as long as that of the Herbsfest, in which he was celebrated.
Hubert Wermter stood as usual in the colours of his male singing club on stage.
Even after 60 years, the singing with the now probably more than loved choir still makes him great fun.
Wermter was also active in the association, including 28 years as a member of the committee.
He was awarded several awards for his engagement and association engagement: Jörg Kohr, pastoral adviser on behalf of the Cäcilienverbandes Rottenburg-Stuttgart, handed him - since the choir is also a church choir - a certificate of the Association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His singer colleagues handed him the certificate of the German choir association as well as a engraved tin counter.
In addition to the honor, the 31st autumn festival was held in traditional courses: With the MGV Better, the Song Crane Salzstetten, the singers' department Baisingen and the local music association, the Vollmaringer had invited a colorful mix of different choirs and singing styles, which included around 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as "In the wine paradise" and "Lustig, her brothers".
Their honorary singer Hubert Wermter prepared for the honor of a small statue - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The men's singing club Beta also sang classical choral songs such as "Jägerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "White, far away" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "When You Pass Through the Valley".
With his mixed choir and his group of women - the "impulscher" - the song star Salzstetten provided the women's share of the festival.
The mixed choir was abducted with the Neapolitan popular style "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus in foreign countries, while the "Impulscher" also applied to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The Baisinger Sportverein's singer-department returned with "What Isch der Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Papert's "Bierlied" to the local section, where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical conclusion.
For the children there was a small programme - "Oma Hannene" a.k.a. Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a Kasperl theatre and read a few stories that the children spent the lunch.
Children's Dreams Become True
The kindergartens and day care facilities in the Zollernalbkreis get post these days.
In cooperation with Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zollernalb, the Black Forest messenger wishes to support the facilities in the realization of their building and beautification wishes.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandpit?
All kindergartens, day care centres and children's schools from all over the Customs Union can participate in the action.
If you have a building or beautification request for your facility, you can apply with this in the Black Forest messenger.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of action kindergarten building site.
A jury, consisting of representatives of Black Forest boats, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, selects three wishes from all entries.
What are the conditions for participation?
The wish should be realized with a maximum value of 2000 Euro and on a (action) day.
In addition, the winner himself must provide many diligent building helpers.
What about the Day of Action and the Helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of the Sparkasse Zollernalb.
It is delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and is then to be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, clubs and of course the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan Press Rebellious About Controversy Media Law
'We are in a frightening situation and we should ask ourselves, 'What does Parliament intend to do about abolishing judicial independence tomorrow', was to read in the paper which considers the draft law to be unconstitutional.
"The law is drastic and very punishable and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of the Capital Group, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news sites in Kenya.
He said that the new media tribunal “will always be biased, because it is an extended arm of government” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya’s position in the global economy.
'I hope the President will listen to us and we call on him to reject this draft law and send it back to Parliament,' he said.
According to The Star, the government took through the new law "the media effectively into a spell". On the other hand, The Standard, Democracy and Freedom of Speech in Kenya had suffered "a heavy blow" and titled the draft as "draconian".
The adoption of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of attacks by armed Islamists at the Westgate Shopping Centre in September.
The Kenyan media attracted the anger of the authorities because they published photographs of security cameras on which it was seen how the units sent to the crime scene allegedly robbed the luxurious shopping center.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by ordering two journalists and a leading media representative to interrogate, even if the invitation was withdrawn after a media insurrection.
According to the new law, media houses can be confiscated with a penalty of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, 'although a single punishment can push most radio stations into bankruptcy'.
In addition, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's living blogosphere description.
If they silence the media, politicians could do whatever they want.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at the nation that calls Kenyan media a decisive control factor in public life.
"If politicians are left to themselves, they lead the country into bankruptcy and us back into the time of hunters and collectors," he commented.
In the past, Kenyan legislators have been causing public trouble.
In May, they voted to reverse the reductions ordered by the National Remuneration Commission and put in force their generous salaries of about 532,000 Schilling duty-free per month – they are among the highest in the world.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream becomes true for FC
In spite of the cold weather and the rain, the city and the football club had nothing to do with the official inauguration ceremony for the artificial grass sports field.
A more pleasant celebration had all wished for last Saturday, but Peter did not want to join in.
Thus all those who came without an umbrella or could not keep one for any reason.
This happened to the musicians who framed the ceremony, as did many speakers.
So wet became the FC President Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
His thanks were first and foremost to Mayor Walter Klummpp, who had been very committed to the implementation of the project, to the municipal council, to the companies involved and to the association members who participated.
Especially Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The restless pensioners placed 400 square meters of pavements for the new paths.
This remarkable volunteer commitment also honoured the Landtag member Karl Rombach.
Other greetings were given to the Urban Sports Committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South Baden Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation for the club's youth department.
Mayor Klummpp recalled that recurring weather-related influences in spring and autumn added to the original lawn site so that it could not be played.
Already 15 years ago, there were the first considerations to solve the problem, when the construction of a third place was planned at the site of the football club or at the real school on the Salinsee.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, thoughts arose about the construction of an artificial lawn sports field, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Concrete plans were taken up two years ago, when FC took over the Schabelstube in Erbpacht, pledged a cost contribution of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the square and approved the country's funding of EUR 104 000.
In October 2012, the municipal council decided to take over the remaining EUR 356 000 to the total cost of EUR 560 000, summing up lumps.
The construction start of the 68 times 108 meters artificial lawn square took place on June 4.
During the construction phase lasting over three months, 3000 cubic metres of earth were taken off, half of which was used for the construction of a Dirt-Bike line.
Union and SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on internal and judicial issues.
For this purpose, the responsible working group met in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, we are dealing with direct democracy, parliamentarians and federal police.
In the morning, the Working Party on Migration and Integration also wanted to continue their deliberations.
This should include the issue of dual citizenship, both sides of which have conflicting ideas.
The SPD wants to end the pressure for immigrant children born in Germany to opt for one - the Union rejects a double passport.
With regard to transport, which is not on this Friday's agenda, the SPD underlined its 'no' to a car toll requested by the CSU.
A Vignette was a "flatrate for the many and therefore environmentally counterproductive", said the SPD negotiator for transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
There was a threat of diversities on rural roads, which were already the main causes of accidents.
Furthermore, the introduction of a toll for all cars would only be a first step from Pronold's point of view.
"There is a risk that compensation for German will be removed at a later date," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing föhnwelle on the Freilichtbühne
Stuttgart - "When will it be the right summer again?" was not really the question on Friday evening at the Freilichtbühne Killesberg.
It was truly a tropical night in Stuttgart.
The best conditions for drummer star Dieter Thomas Kuhn and his band.

Serious injury to motorists in the event of an accident
In an accident on Thursday evening, a 37-year-old car driver from Aachen was severely injured.
According to the police, a 41-year-old from Musch was on his way to Grefrath with her car at 9:15 p.m. on the Kempener outer ring.
When she wanted to turn left onto St. Töniser Strasse, she oversaw the opposite car of the 37-year-old.
The cab collided.
The Aachener suffered serious injuries and had to be brought to the hospital for treatment.
Constance: Blocking after an accident at the Schänzlekreisel
The accident had come according to police, when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss seat Ibiza drove out on Thursday evening, around 8pm, on the left track of the two-track Reichenaustraße.
Shortly before the roundabout at the Schänzle he noticed that he was on the left turn track towards Stromeyersdorfstraße and switched to the right track.
This led to a collision with the BMW of a 23-year-old constanzer.
Also damaged was the driving VW Passat of a 19-year-old.
A total of about 15000 material damage was reported by the police.
The road had to be blocked during the accident, it continued.
Vienna Airport organises passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
Telling about how this will happen in future at Vienna-Schwechat Airport.
A large part of the loudspeaker transmissions thus disappears - the noise level should be reduced so clearly.
Creating a relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As Airport Spokesman Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Wien, Vienna Airport follows an international trend with the setting of press releases that affect individuals.
For example, airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai are already avoiding the noisy calls.
Due to the disappearance of these messages - on average, about 200 personal calls by the speakers on a day's day - the airport will be quieter in the future.
"It has also been shown in experience that these individual passages have been perceived relatively little, but at the same time all other information about changed flight rises or departure times is going a bit under way here," said Kleemann in conversation with the radio station.
Highlander-Games at the Kaltenhof
There is also a second competition at the agricultural autumn festival at the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September, in addition to the braking train with tractors.
On Saturday, September 7th, the Highlander-Games will start at 1.30 p.m.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they are hung in the Kaltenhof Swabish.
Teams and single fighters measure themselves in the disciplines of wooden pitching, hoofing and watering.
The tree trunk is four and a half metres long and 25 to 30 kilograms heavy.
"It does not go far," explains organizer Peter Saile.
The stem has to be thrown out vertically, should be skipped once and then come to the lying.
This will be assessed with most of the points.
When throwing hoofs, it depends on the target accuracy.
From eight meters away is thrown on a plock.
Skill and strength must be demonstrated by the participants in carrying more than 50 metres of water.
Time and quantity of water in a bottle are measured at the end.
Two may then take part in the individual competition from each "Clan" or team.
The winners of the team and individual competition receive prizes.
You can be trained from 10 a.m. on.
A suitable clothing is desired, for example, the contestants can compete in the lap skirt.
But also Swabian costume is allowed.
For the "outfit" the jury gives a few bonus points.
You can log in up to an hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish and Swabian Highlander Games and the tractor pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, a lot of action is already being requested on the mainland on Saturday.
In the evening the bubble music friends come to their expense.
At 7 p.m., the Biraböhmische Blasmusik from Schömberg designed the great entertainment evening.
The chapel plays hot Polkas and fairy tales.
Their repertoire also includes sensitive rollers and a cool big band sound.
With it, Heinz Koch from hamlets will be known as singing host and black sausage baron.
In Dornhan he has already appeared at the Christmas market and at the Narrenzuft.
On Sunday, the Musikverein conducts Leinstetten to the morning shovel, starting at 2 p.m., the peasant chapel Böffingen is a guest, and the "Oldies" then let the festival end.
Starting on Friday, the Stopelacker Party with DJ Ralf is already up.
Other program points on Saturday and Sunday include the Oldtimer and Schlepperstätte, exhibitions by companies on the subject of agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday are the Maislavyrinth, the craftsman market and the sheep shearing.
Especially for children there is a strike zoo, strohhöpfburg, tractor ride (under instruction) and tractor surfing.
The organisers are the Förderverein multipurpose hall, the ski club and the tractor friends "Zündkäpsele".
Milk and egg alternatives at a glance
Vegan diet requires herbal alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Purified tofu with plant tooth, for example, is a quarking set.
The Vegetarian Federation is also called the World Vegan Day on 1 November.
The German Vegetarian Federation proposes a number of vegan alternatives on the occasion of the World Vegan Day on 1 November:
Pure plant margarine was a good alternative to butter, yoghurt replace by soy yoghurt.
Instead of milk, soy, oat, almond or rice milk can be used.
Retractable plant teeth replace conventional whipped teeth.
There are also plant alternatives to eggs.
For example, half a crushed, mature banana can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple or a tablespoon of ground linen seeds plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for this.
Loose doughs become instead of egg, for example, with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder, a tablespoon of strength and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But also 50 grams soyoghurt or silkentofu can fulfil this purpose.
According to the Vebu, some 800 000 people currently feed on vegans in Germany, i.e. just plant.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to her host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Schwarzwald-Gymnasium met the American city of New York.
After eight hours of flight, it went straight to Brooklyn Bridge, over which the heart of the city, Manhattan, was reached on foot.
Here was already a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which in the evening light makes a special appeal.
Due to the time shift, the students were on their feet for almost 24 hours, but true to the motto "The city does not sleep" was decided the day on Times Square.
Despite Shutdown, on the second day the Statue of Liberty was reached by ferry and climbed on foot.
It was then the financial center around Wall Street to the memorial of September 11.
On the third day, the students were able to gain an overview of the fascinating large city from the 373-metre-high view platform of the Empire-State Building.
Afterwards, it was through the hectic driving of the New York streets across the Rockefeller Center to the Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity for short stays in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have arrived in their host families and are experiencing school life at the Weymouth High School.
This year, too, a Hubertus Mass is celebrated on the name of Saint Hubertus in the parish church of St. Mary on Hülsbergstraße.
St. Hubertus was the story of a rather ruthless hunter who was converted by a vision and later appointed Bishop of Liège.
The hunting horn blower group of the Westphalians under the direction of Brigitte Kluth music on Parforce horns (natural horns in the mood of Es) according to old, original French melodies.
The blowers wear riding clothing because they mainly accompany riders, horses and dogs on tow hunts musically.
The ceremony will take place on Sunday, November 3, at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed look shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to stay and come back.
One that wants to make the name the program.
According to Lexicon, Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that is expressed in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation.
In the event of the visit of the same-named café at the turnoff in the district city of Kleve in terms of visibility to the University of Rhein-Waal, it does not have to remain during the pure Déjà Vu feeling.
Finally, the café with the beautiful name has exactly that to aim: making an actual stay not only thoughtful, but always consistently experienced again and again.
Because it's just fun and it's just nice.
A view into the inner life at notice 8 gives a good feeling to the viewer on top of it.
The state-of-the-art, but not cool cafe-ambient looks like a place to feel good.
Here, the team pampers the guest with founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top with various coffee or cocktail variants.
There are delicious cakes or individually occupied fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, made a name for themselves before the opening of the tasty café at the Opschlag as a gastronomist: in Kranenburg they led the "Art Lounge".
From the move to Kleve to the opschlag, the sympathetic café lovers are hoping for more audiences.
Not least through the university as well.
"Where we don't have a specific target group," emphasizes Daniel Büttner.
Instead, the two young students here want to address as well as the seniors and all ages between them.
Speaking of Café-Liebhaber.
The friendly couple are behind the coffee pleasure.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in various variations themselves.
Expressophane
Daniel Büttner is more of the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the cappuccino drinker.
"For that, a baguette - that's my thing," she told the NRZ.
There were two events in the bright café.
Better say one.
Because the harbor festival took place rather outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the night of the Ringelnatz.
"Beautiful, successful and funny", the two 33-year-olds found.
But not everyone's thing.
Perhaps Daniel Büttner is also not an excellent fan of events-evenings: "You can't do it right now."
And with an event I always only address those who are also interested in the special event.
This is why events will be the exception for us.
"We want to interfere with normal operation as little as possible".
To be called: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
With regard to the quality of the products offered here, as well as to the team and the beautiful environment at the turnout in Kleve.
The street, which is becoming more and more a gastronomy mile.
To the delight of many clubs, the guests from close to and far and the students who discover the gasstrom ropes and thus also the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A day of thanks at MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th Stiftungsfest to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, had gladly arrived.
In the club room of the restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker, all enjoyed the harmonious cooperation completely in the sign of music.
Traditionally, the foundation festival is always the right firmness to perform honors.
About the special award "Songers of the Year" this time the writer Rolf Wagener was pleased.
"You have not only written down a lot for us, but also played a number of laps for us, for our warm thanks," said the chairman of the Choir Erich Schlotmann.
This year the awards for participation in the performances and choir rehearsals by means of activity costumes went to the choir director Dieter Schulze with 44 participants, followed by the honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and last year's "songner of the year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participants each.
==References====External links==
A special thank you was addressed by the board to the team of club manager Ange Pier-Ribbert, who once again had conjured up a menu of the extra class and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets his regular choral samples at 19.45 p.m. at the club's premises.
"New vocals are always welcome to us," says Schlotmann.
UN announces new goals in combating poverty
The United Nations is starting to develop a series of new targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals announced twelve years ago to combat poverty.
In the run-up to the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in the advance of "sustainable development goals" to replace the Millennium Goals that expire in 2015.
They were included in the final draft document adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced in the evening that the time had come to 'think beyond national interests'.
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch a process to achieve universal, sustainable development goals," he said.
"These objectives will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will not hesitate to implement this mandate given me by the Member States in order to realise our vision of sustainable development goals based on the success of the Millennium Goals."
Even if SG Achim/Baden has been without victory for four days, the Handball-Oberligist continues to have a good mood.
There's no doubt about that, Coach Tomasz Malmon.
Everyone is still fully motivated in the matter.
Nevertheless, I hope that we will finally win again.
"For I don't know what a victory tastes like," Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the Third League Reserve from Fredenbeck has currently not broken out of trees, Malmon has in advance warned the index finger.
I have trained many players in the A-Jugend myself.
Therefore, they will certainly be especially motivated against their ex-coach.
"In addition, it is important to wait for reinforcement from the first," explains the SG-Coach.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must definitely increase in comparison to the previous performances.
Above all, in the cover work and in the switchover game, it did have a huge impact.
There is also a need to improve the use of opportunities.
That's why I hope my players finally get their heads free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in view of clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and first president of Mozambique to vote in a rare public demonstration of peace calls.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, Managing Director of an investment company.
For fear of the future of the country, she exchanged her business clothes against a T-shirt with the words "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday on the independence square of the capital.
For nearly two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which have been among the worst battles since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement which was initially supported by White-ruled Rhodes and later by the apartheid government of South Africa in the effort to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After the 1992 peace treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts think it is unlikely that the country will return to an adult conflict, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.
For the fast growing economy, much is at stake because the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal stocks in the north-west could bring in investments of over 50 billion US dollars from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the USA in the coming years.
The governing Frelimo party, since 1975 the dominant force, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government has provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional high castle of Renamos on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government troops attacked Renamo's bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, explained Renamo's spokesman to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of having attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to minimize concerns about instability.
In contrast to AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered himself a 'loser' who wants to use all his remaining powers to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government.
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war.
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted in the words, Renamo gave up the 1992 peace agreement.
In contrast to FT, he stated that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our vision is to resume negotiations seriously," said Mazanga.
Previous discussions between the parties have contributed little to the resolution of tensions fired by a series of clashes this year.
"We have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who collide with each other," says Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them is good at negotiating and none are willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is pressing for electoral reforms, has already stated that she will boycott the local elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt by an incriminating movement to produce concessions and financial advantages from the government.
Renamo's election has shrunk since 1992, while a newer party, founded by a former Renamo member, Movimento Democratico de Moçambique (MDM), is expected to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – his resignation when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He does not want a multiparty democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidential office," says Mazanga.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but it has undertaken disturbing attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South connection.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, which is located a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port, the mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June Rio interrupted the use of the railways for one month after Renamo had announced an attack on the track.
Mazanga replied withholding the question whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique," said Mazanga.
Instability has increased the frustration over the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people were already concerned about corruption, slowing progress in development and a recent abduction wave.
"People think that the government and the President are responsible for the future of the country and that he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, said people just wanted stability.
"No one is interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and easy-to-use streets again," he explained.
Children should be taught myths and legends as "models of life", says one author.
The stories of Thor showed that "brutal force has no chance against clever tricks", and the artus legends demonstrate how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths, however, are "too far too wild, too offensive and in some cases too dirty to be taught at schools", which is why Crossley-Holland argued for a "careful choice" of old-fashioned works.
"I find it wonderful that myths and folklore are already part of education in America," he said.
I have been proposing this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that in authors and teachers who were "abovely didactic", children would be "abstained completely", for in entertaining stories the messages would be "subdued".
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon and is author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myth and the British Folk Tales, said: "One can pursue certain intentions, but one should keep them in the background as much as possible."
Perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to the happy end, but there is an unmistakable sense of good and evil.
This must be understated, revealed by history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing instead of telling stories.
Hansjakob pulls again in Freihof
100 years ago Heinrich Hansjakob acquired his age-rest seat in Haslach, and on Sunday his last years became alive in the "Freihof".
The many spectators were thrilled by the extremely short play of the scene.
From the arrival to the bestowal of honorary citizenship until his death, screenwriter and Hansjakobstarst Alois Kraftzcyk had designed a entertaining piece, which received much approval under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explained the contexts and the bridged rises from the youth to the approaching retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob comes home in his children's heaven, into his courtyard.
And then the scene game began, in which Alois Krafczyk once more shined in his parade role as the great son of the city.
Stilecht led by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach with the two-legged and "Schwarzwälder Füchsen".
He was not only welcomed by the audience with much applause, his sister Philippine also welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood incredibly well to get into the role of the sister and gave her life in Mimik and Gestik immensely.
Between the individual play scenes, the Mühlenbacher Bauernkapelle played appropriately selected pieces of music and rounded off the performance.
Haslach's mayor, Heinz Winkler, then gave the honor to the honor, who, in representation of the then official of Hättich, together with a part of the city council, made his honour.
Their anticipation then made the Three King singers, which led Hansjakob to the exclamation: "As beautiful as it is, there are again youth memories of my own Three King time."
With their song "O Jesselin" they enjoyed the audience in the open court as well as the storchentag children with their loud "Out, Out".
His criticism of the Church at that time Hansjakob had expressed just as much as his concerns about the expansion of agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of war.
In the homeland, behind his tomb chapel on the fire near Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A restful spirit had finally found its rest and had gone home forever," it said at the end of the scene.
There was a lot of applause and many praiseworthy words from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The Hope of Neckar Giants Grows
The chances of continuing the sporty decline of Ludwigsburger Bundesliga-Basketballer have increased.
If there is a game card procedure, there is now a competitor less for the Neckar Giants.
The Hamburg Towers Basketball Project does not have an application for a possible rearer seat.
"We will not participate in the Wildcard process," said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been setting up the concept for a professional club in Hansestadt since 2012.
However, a first breath was not to be heard from Ludwigsburg.
"We didn't deal with the Wildcard process so long that Düsseldorf won't get a license," said Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper.
Until May 23rd Düsseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the Arbitration Court and prove its economic Bundesliga suitability.
So far, however, the license has been refused twice to the Rhine countries.
The arbitral tribunal shall be the last instance.
Haigerloch: The Church of the Evening Meal comes to the fore
As a contribution to the city's 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city's cultural and tourism office dedicates the last of its public guided tours on Sunday, October 27th, the evening meal church.
After the visit of the nuclear museum, the Haigerloch period after 1850 is to be considered when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The crowning end point is a visit to the Evening Meal Church.
There the leaders get the story of the church's construction told and gained insight into the development of the Evangelical church in a continuous Catholic area.
Not least, the church also overlooks the evening meal painting created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is an original reproduction of the famous Milan model of Leonardo da Vinci.
The meeting point to the second half-hour tour is at 3 pm at the nuclear museum.
There are maps at the cashier of the nuclear museum.
The tourist office of Haigerloch is available for questions and information.
Snowden could also say in Russia
The former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in the U.S. pewter business in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the Bundesverwaltungsverwaltung could either ask written questions or meet the 30-year-olds personally in Russia.
This was reported by the Interfax Agency, calling for unidentified circles familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be clarified intergovernmentally, it said.
A trip out of Snowdens from Russia is practically excluded.
"In this case, he loses his refugee status," the agency quoted her source.
Because Germany was ally of the USA, snowden threatened the delivery there, it continued
Long breath pays off
Six men fought for the winning title at the tennis tournament of the clubs.
In the end, the endurance of the Maier/Bronner team decided the last match.
A dream weather had received the tennis division of the sports friends Rohrdorf as the tournament of the local clubs and friends.
The fun of playing tennis was in the foreground of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the plan, each playing against everyone.
It was played in double mode with a long sentence up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes.
Anja Schlichter leads the tournament
The tournament lead was in the proven hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament went to the decisive phase.
The favorites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were with Michael Klipsel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of SG Rohrweiler), so the last two matches had to make the decision.
At the victory ceremony, Carmen Müller was finally able to pass the hiking cup to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the finish line.
The second place was the double Michael Kliptel/Sadmin Osmicic.
The bronze staircase reached Rainer and Bernd Maier of the team Asphaltrecher.
The final sound of the tournament took place in late afternoons and coffee and cakes.
On the last week of August, the Schwarzwälder Freilichtmuseum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is again in the hands of children.
Traditionally, the museum is called the visitors on Saturday and Sunday, 24 and 25 August, as part of the summer holiday program, to welcome visitors to a colourful children's and family festival with numerous co-actions and events.

Speed and coordination are needed here.
For all small detectives, the open-air museum on Saturday and Sunday, at 12 and 14 o'clock each, offers a mystery tour through the museum.
On a runaway trip, the children have to guess which stories correspond to the truth or are yet lied.
In addition, the visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a carriage ride with black forests foxes.
Not only horses, but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens are to be found and admired on the grounds.

On both days of the event, there are also numerous tradesmen, such as the Besenbinder, the nearer, the spinster, the weaver and the baker in their traditional work over the shoulder.
Until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, the visitors to the Freilichtmuseum await a varied holiday program.
In a New Zealand town Burt Muro is considered to be a loving Kauz because he made his way to take part in a race in America with his motorcycle, built in 1920.
Burt, despite a heart mistake, is not abstinent from his dream.
With his savings, a couple of donations and a mortgage on his old workshop sheds, he transfers to Los Angeles by ship.
After the film there are coffee, tea and cake.
Schrilles Piepsen disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily in land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the Halde.
The company has several irons in fire at the site.
In addition to coal imports, Rhenus Midgard relies on wind turbines logistics.
Black shimmers the coal in the storage area in front of the dike.
Two huge blue racks and backloaders distribute or charge the coal here as needed.
Every movement of the envelopes sounds like a loud alarm sound across the terrain.
"The signals serve security and are required by law," says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rheinus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, in the event of an unfavorable wind, this is to be heard far away - and so there were already some complaints from people from the city order.
He took the actions very seriously and therefore contacted the interested parties, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, it was now necessary to keep the warning signals quieter with technical measures.
In future, he also put on the open dialogue with his neighbours.
Because Matthias Schrell still has some things to do at the site.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the 18.5 metre-deep basin of form terminal, Capesize-Bulkcarrier can long be completed here.
"This year, we want to crack the 3-million ton brand while wrapping," says Schrell.
In addition to the Eon power station on site, the imported coal goes to domestic power plants.
If the GDF-Suez power plant still goes to the grid, well over 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year would be realistic.
The three ship loaders on the bridge and the second conveyor belt could create up to 10 million.
Bavaria's basketball player despite first defeat optimistic
Even the first defeat in the EuroLeague was not able to diminish the enormous optimism among the basketball players of FC Bayern Munich.
"No one can forbid us from believing in winning against the best team in Europe in the last two years," commented Bayern-Coach Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday evening at the title defender Olympiakos Piraeus.
We sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
At its first third appearance in the European king class, the Munichers sold themselves very well for a long time, but were simply not clear enough in the decisive stages.
The guests initially created the art piece, a 15-point redundancy 13 minutes before turning into a guided tour, before Piraeus gave another turn to the game.
"We fought back incredibly against the two-time EuroLeague champion, but then again made loathsome mistakes," Yassin Idbihi said.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful throwers of the Munichers, who celebrated a victory in the first two games against the Italian serial champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish champion Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the birthplace of Stand-up Comedy in America: Almost a hundred years ago, the variete artist Frank Fay, who worked as a competitor at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, started to tell the crowd of direct jokes in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fay's innovation has been expanded, as was the last time at the New York Comedy Festival.
Founded and led by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Caroline stand-up institute, this year the festival celebrates its 10th anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
"Most of these headliners started at Caroline's and then became more and more successful until they were known at some point to perform in a club," said Hirsch.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them.
At this year's event, there are performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher as well as by "Stand Up for Heroes", an annual music and comedy benefice event for army veterans in Madison Square Garden, which includes Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
With the festival the world of Comedy has also grown.
A number of comedians who participate in this year's festival have become known through rather unconventional ways, such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was known with a sitcom on cable television (the ironic-slip fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the crew both at Saturday Night Live and at Parks and Recreation, although she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both krroll and slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, focused on racial themes W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
Among the biggest visitors of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg is talking to Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a prestigious television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he moderated a television broadcast entitled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" at TV Land.
The meeting takes place in Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," said Steinberg.
He told me when he's here, sometimes he goes through the alley between two buildings and thinks, hey, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here.
Iran satisfied with the process of nuclear negotiations
Iran is showing itself a week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN Vetomachts and Germany satisfied with the negotiation process.
"After years one now had an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to eliminate the differences of the last years," wrote Foreign Minister Mohammed Jawad Sarif on his Facebook page.
It would be a long way to go, but the nuclear negotiator was satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that in the end both sides will find a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys kill game camwheels with machete
Two children in Uruguay have confessed to the murder of an 11-year-old.
The two 14 - and 12 - year - old boys had invited their victims to accompany them on bird hunt.
Armed with Machetten and knives, they caught the 11-year-olds on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, reported the newspaper "El País".
They would then have played in front of their homes in a working quarter of football.
The body was found in the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach town of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five - year - old half - sister of the disciple who had taken her should have said that she had been sexually attacked by the boy.
But when the girl described the tattoo before the police without mentioning an attack on her, the two boys committed the intentional killing of the 11-year-old.
As a reason, the elder among other things called a rivalry in the football game.
He was provisionally transferred to a psychiatric youth institution.
Poultry has to go to prison.
Because of exploitative human trafficking, detention, threat, insult and dangerous body injury, the County Court of Konstanz sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years imprisonment.
The former Bundeswehr soldier, who worked as a doorkeeper after two missions in Afghanistan, made a confession within the framework of a trial agreement.
Thus, in five cases, he met women via Internet or telephone contacts, which he sent on the line after a few weeks against her will.
He used to break up with violence and threats.
He retained the income of the women who had partly bought for him for years.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he made contact with women to the outside world.
Together with a colleague who provided the women, he brought them to various brothels in the southwest.
There he had them monitored in part to control their revenue.
The defendant first claimed that he was suffering from a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan had been killed in an explosion next to him.
After a psychiatric expert expressed great doubts about the psychological restriction and therefore a limited liability, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court no longer had to hear from any of the injured women.
As one Kripo official reported, at least four further cases of exploitative human trafficking were identified after an initial call surveillance exercise.
The overheard conversations were marked by high aggression.
In later hearings the injured had confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, one of the women who had discovered blue spots all over the body, has not yet made any statement.
It is about "a completely broken personality", which sees violence and exploitation in this metier as normal.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He has separated himself from these circles and wants to live a normal life after imprisonment," he said.
Oil price continues after up to USD 96 per barrel
The oil price continued to fall on Friday after concerns about a high supply overshadowed a report, according to which the energy-intensive manufacturing sector in China is growing.
The reference raw oil varieties for deliveries in December had fallen in the late morning in Europe in electronic commerce at the New York Mercantile Exchange by 14 cents to USD 96.24 per barrel.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a price decline of 5.8 percent in October.
The great supply of crude oil has been a burden on prices in recent weeks.
The US Ministry of Energy said on Wednesday that the US offer had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, the offer had increased by 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, there were signs of increased demand from two reports of an increase in Chinese production activity.
This suggests a continued recovery of China's economy, which had increased to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after it had reached its lowest level in the previous quarter for two decades.
Crude oil from Brent, a reference value for international crude oil, also used by American refineries, fell at the ICE Exchange in London by 26 cents to USD 108.58 per barrel.
Court blocks decision on the NYPD stop-and-frisk directive
On Thursday, a Federal Court of Appeal in the United States blocked the appointment of a judge who had called for changes to the stop-and-frisk program ("Anhalts and Search") of the New York Police Department, and dismissed the judge from the case.
The second U.S. appeal court stated that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until an appeal of the city was decided.
The judge had judged in August that the city violated the Constitution by the way the program for stopping and questioning people was implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the ordered remedies, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police in amending their directive and the corresponding training programme.
The appeal court heard the arguments on the requested suspension on Tuesday.
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be relieved of the case because she had violated the Code of Conduct for U.S. judges by stating that a judge should avoid the appearance of partyism; this was partly based on a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had responded publicly to the criticism of the court.
The judge had judged that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, because they misguided black and Latin American men with the stop-and-frisk program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of substantial changes, including reforms in directives, training and service supervision, and arranged for a pilot programme with cameras carried out on the body in quarters where most controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York declared itself ready to end the practice of storing names and addresses of persons who were released after police control.
An oral hearing on the city's vocation is scheduled after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-frisk tactics have been criticised by a number of civil rights defenders.
This type of control has been in various forms for decades, but the number of checks recorded during the term of office of the partyless mayor Michael Bloomberg has increased to an all-time high of 684.330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men who belonged to all the minorities filed a lawsuit that developed into a collective complaint.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD stop-and-frisk program say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trusted and effective police force as well as influence the way other police officers use the regulation.
Opposers believe that the changes would dampen the morals of the police, but not the crime; also money wasted and the wider problem of a police who were under pressure after the disappearance of thousands of places in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that it did not end the stop-and-frisk practice, which was constitutional, but only reformed the way in which the NYPD controls were implemented.
Of the happiness of the dreaming camels
Happiness is an oasis that succeeds to reach only dreaming camels
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Helping Hands".
On Saturday afternoon, the tenth birthday of the club was celebrated, which can already have considerable success.
The first president, Henne, reported in detail on the association's work.
He himself was the first time in Mauritania in 2004 at the Cheijk Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, a further cooperation developed, and on-site Gynecologist Henne performed numerous operations on several trips.
During the speeches, images of the stakes were shown on a large screen, so that the guests of the anniversary event could take a picture of the actions mentioned above.
The club's desert vehicle was also shown.
This is a former German border protection vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had made the proposal to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now, according to Henne, is planning to work in advisory function at the association.
In 2008, Zimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn created the medical station in Socogim, a miserable neighborhood on the outskirts of the capital, in the record time of just about a week.
She also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times when the birth clinic is to be rationalized away in Nagold.
You learn a lot in Africa as a doctor, she says, for example, acceleration against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, you couldn't travel as many as planned, but many doctors came to Germany to stay here in different areas.
In addition, containers with material are regularly sent to Africa, such as in March this year medical devices, medications, bandages, hospital beds and glasses.
The co-initiator Hans-Joachim Füttel himself provided abundant local coloration by telling from Mauritania about the Mercedes vehicles converted to the mobile goat stall and the experiences of the regular home musicians, who traditionally support the association, during their Mauritanian journey.
As his personal motivation, he called his work in the field of auditing as a young Member.
When he realized how much money was lost along the way, he decided to help Africans control a budget by the people.
In addition, moisture stressed that global economy also demands global human love.
Nor should it be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
It was not far from Gran Canaria to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip
The former news of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "telephone hacking, monitoring and confrontation" to try to confirm a false tip about an affair by the former Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC declared to the court in Old Bailey, News of the World heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive special advisor" Hannah Pawlby.
The paper instructed the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's voicemails, and persecuted them, but Coulson also called them and left messages as the court heard.
"In the opinion of the public prosecutor, Coulson, who is now the editor of the emergency, is no one standing in front of the apartment of people hoping to catch them in the freshest act, but one who likes to confront people with a story in order to see their reaction," Edis explained.
He said, NotW uses three methods to investigate stories investigatively: phone hacking, monitoring and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows about the second, the supervision, otherwise it can't be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He dispels this, but we say, "And whether he knew about it."
Rumors about an affair Clarkes were first picked up by the feature reaction of NotW when a source who was sexually interested in Pawlby was said: "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
A band with voicemails from their phone of at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaire's apartment.
The investigators also found entries on the detective's computer where Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects".
In the time when the detectives ran, the grandparents of Pavlby received anonymous calls asking for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the surveillance of Pawlby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: "I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow about which I would like to talk to Charles."
Edis explained that Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as with other important personalities, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The defendants heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had been confronted by a married woman because of an affair when he himself had suffered with Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks disputed to have sworn with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone hacking.
From protest against the planned rich tax, the French football has actually been going through the first strike since 1972.
A conciliation meeting will come to an end without results.
In the conflict over the rich tax, the government and the professional football in France have maneuvered into a dead end following a failed conciliation meeting.
President François Hollande received representatives from the Association and Association on Thursday at the Élysée-Palast, Paris. He also listened to their complaints.
However, he refused to rescind the football from the planned 75 percent tax on income of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country will pay for two years from 2014.
The opposite side also remained hard.
The strike announced for the end of November is now also being carried out, the chief association of the professional clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, announced.
The days of play in the Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 between 29 November and 2 December are therefore excluded.
Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the inhabitants in the planning at an early stage," said Mayor Jens Höussler, opening the citizens' information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
About 80 participants had come to the municipal hall to explain the measures planned, to ask questions, to express concerns and to bring ideas.
Haeußler made it clear: "The final decisions are taken by the members of the municipal council".
The flood, which struck Gechingen unprepared on May 15, 2009, was an incisive event that raised the question of protection measures for the future, says Hüßler.
A river basin survey was commissioned with the neighbouring community of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The goal is to protect as many built land as possible," says Hüßler.
The planning of the protection against a flood is planned statistically every 100 years, according to the German Weather Service.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15% surcharge.
In specialist circles this is referred to as "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masses that caused considerable damage in Gehingen in 2009 amounted to a 1000-year flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," Hüßler said.
In order to achieve the HQ 100aKlima protection, around four million euros must be invested in Gechingen, with the municipality accounting for around 70 percent of national grants.
Mr Haustler pointed out, however, that only if an overall approach was implemented would there be support.
In this context, the community was dependent on the participation of the citizens.
A complex planning and authorisation procedure had to be completed.
In the best case, implementation could be started in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept presented in the municipal council last week (we reported) foresees local measures in the influx of liquid Irm from the Stammheim valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, participants took the opportunity to address their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why no more dams and reservoirs were planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, professional planner of the responsible engineering office Wald and Corbe from Höllsheim, who introduced the concept, stressed that it required the interaction of all the measures presented in order to achieve the desired goal in the sum.
In addition, they were kept to find the most economical solution, says Joachim Wald von Wald and Corbe.
Dismal conditions prevailed in the site of the old town, which, even in the case of normal rainstorms, are constantly suffering from an overload of the canal network.
The problem is known in the administration and the first measures have already been taken.
However, he pointed out that the guidelines for sewerage systems were different from those for flood protection and that this should not be mixed.
The municipality was obliged to interpret the network in such a way that two to three years of rain could be achieved.
Larger dimensions of wastewater canals would swallow millions.
Severely injured after collision
In the early Friday afternoon two drivers were severely injured on Landesstraße 44 near Revensdorf in a frontal collision.
The police immediately blocked the road completely, but could say little at first about the accident.
However, there are various testimonies that should be evaluated first.
It is certain that the 19-year-old lady of a VW Golf drove towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collided together, the woman being so tightly clamped that the fire brigade needed about half an hour to free them from the wreckage.
The real cause of the accident remained unexplained at first.
Both victims arrived in nearby hospitals.
The track remained closed for about two hours.
He could be called the US Dostoyevsky.
Philip K. Dick was a god seeker, a metaphysicist, his novels and stories also have something serial.
Astonishing the external kinship: the stinging eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And just as Fjodor M. Dostoyevski, with his massive oeuvre as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, is to be read by Philip K. Dick as an American prophet, who is quite valid in his own country.
Some titles have appeared in the Heyne publishing house, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories distributes two thousand one.
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technical progress, paired with Paranoia, Security Guard and the belief to be chosen.
Dick had God's experiences, his late books read like a mixture from the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy. He had drugs added to his brain.
He understood, early on, that the calculators are divinities.
He wrote a computer theology and asked what distinguishes a person from a machine, the Creator from his creature.
This is the "Blade Runner" problem.
The killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is particularly significant now.
The "Mindial Report" dates back to 1956, and it exudes the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tributal.
The principle of "pre-crime" is developed here, which is what is now more or less the official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which looks like our shocking, mutants look to the future - and the police are closing.
"We record individuals who have not violated any law," says the head of the authority.
"We get them even before they can commit a crime of violence."
And: "In our society there are no heavy criminals, we have a criminal camp full of Pesudo criminals." You read Timestreams.
They assume that bad things happen, and prevent the criminal thought from being put into practice.
Dick's story looks like the blueprint for the anti-terrorist laws and the NSA's hearing noise.
Anticipation of the attack: Obama's drone philosophy and practice also work.
But Dick's story isn't over yet.
The police chief complains that there is no more division of powers, the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the guard is monitored himself and transferred to a future crime.
The system's going crazy.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It creates its own conditions.
Take mistakes and victims not only in purchase, but builds on them.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Reading Philip K. Dick means getting closer to the truth again and again.
Seeing Merkel in Russia Proclaiming
The former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. affairs of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Prosecution could either ask written questions or meet the 30-year-olds personally in Russia, the agency reported Interfax.
Previously, Hans-Christian Ströbele, a member of the Green Bundestag, had met in Moscow yesterday as the first German politician Snowden to talk to him about the affair.
NSA disclosures reinforce company paranoia due to state surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep over the US consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany's financial capital.
At the direction of the Federal Office for the Protection of Constitution and Terrorism (BVT), the German Home Office, he should photograph the roof of the U.S. outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to German media BVT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a word exchange between the USA and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, once again stated in September that the United States did not use the possibility of foreign espionage "to steal the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies so that they could increase their international competitiveness or profit."
However, since Edward Snowden, who has become a Whistleblower, has begun publishing his full-horn on American surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure that they can speak to the Director.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency is spying on the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and has obtained data from American cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, have brought paranoia to a new peak due to state surveillance.
The process led to the disclosure that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was initiated, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe is able to come to visit, corporate management is certainly also potential goals.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between US secret services and companies transparent.
I think it is conceivable that this data will be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," explains Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, who represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the USA was now almost as high a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, such a survey published by the consultant company EY in July.
However, there has been no evidence in the documents leaked by Snowden that the US has passed on the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet capabilities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
The companies are sceptical about this.
In the Bundestag it was suggested that we build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again ...
"This is not how it works," says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you shouldn't have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything except for the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the reach and technical refinement of the U.S. spying agencies discovered by the snowden disclosures have shocked companies that had previously seen the biggest spying risk in China.
Cloud Computing is undergoing a major change because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US are subject to the case law there and are therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a commercial institution, the disclosures of US-American data mining activities with prism rejected about ten percent of non-US-based members' plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, Deputy Managing Director of SAP, says: "We see a new question from customers that there hasn't been a year ago – she says: Where are my data stored and can you guarantee that this physical will remain in this legal space?"
Many German corporate leaders support the view that the latest reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore have to be guarded at all costs.
The fact that economic espionage is taking place is no surprise.
It's always been like that.
"It has been a subject for many years and has not changed fundamentally due to the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the BASF chemical company.
The Americans are spying on us at a commercial and industrial level, just as we are, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
Corporate governance does not normally boast of the countermeasures that have been taken, as this brings benefits to attackers.
In large companies, employees have been impressed for a long time that taking a free USB stick on a trade fair or unattended laying of a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable.
Ulrich Hackenberk, board member at Automanufacturer Audi, says that it has been a standard practice for years to collect mobile phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as hearing aids.
The German BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid phones when travelling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their niches.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets against unauthorised access," warns BVT in a report.
The USA warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to Washington Post, in February France, Russia, and Israel, the US National Intelligence Estimate placed two of the countries behind China that used to obtain economic data from hacking.
A board member of a German Blue-Chip company agreed when it comes to economic espionage, then "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French interior intelligence DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: "The intelligence services know very well that all countries, even when working together in the fight against terrorism, spy out their allies."
Hechingen: Mass gives an answer to wedding questions
"Marriage is the most important voyage of discovery that man can make," said philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips on how at least the wedding ceremony was successful now gave a special fair at the domain in Hechingen.
Retired were important providers around a wedding.
A trend: The retro look has held back.
This starts with the wedding dresses.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
At the front are the often rustled and closed with embroidery, often with a veil, but at the back they go down the back and often end up in a tow.
Since, however, the ghosts differ, as Stefanie Koch emphasizes from the fashion house dressmiller.
In men, the suit dominates with vests and plastic, but it can also be selected cream-coloured or brown combinations.
Important is the selection of the local, has been explained.
Jewelry-free side rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be special.
Here the domain drew attention to its own offer in the Remise.
Anyone who wants to go ahead with the carriage, Uwe Link has an offer for it.
"Kuts are also popular for young women's farewells," he says.
Romance is also required for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
More and more in fashion come the "after-wedding photo" - so recording series in special places, preferably for instance waterfalls, a few days after the party, but in wedding clothes, Elisabeth Keidel explained.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented on Sunday in the domain.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cakes and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests stylishly.
Do not forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable party.
Dog Friends Successful
For the time being, the athletes of the dogs friends Bitz were successful on a rally-obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Candel with two dogs; with his bitch Sandy he scored 94 points in the class of Beginner and secured the fifth place, and with the 15-month-old Marley he brought it with 87 points to place twelve.
Susi Hopp took a critical look at the performer with her woody in class 1.
Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The teen's parents, whose body was found in a rolled-up ring mat in the gym of his high school, are convinced that her son was murdered, explained the family's lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta, Georgia, was found in an upright mat on January 11 behind the grandstand at the Schulturnhalle.
The detectives of Lowndes County's sheriffs concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old's family doubted.
"They are convinced that their son was murdered," explained Benjamin Crump, the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, to FoxNews.com.
They never thought he died the way the sheriff concluded it.
"They believe that there is no logic that violates both the laws of physics and the common sense," says Crump.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth is hidden in order to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"Your son went to school to study and came back in the body bag," he commented.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal investigation of Johnson's death, as a number of important questions are still unsolved.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
This was explained by Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in whatever direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believed that there was a sufficient basis for a formal investigation," he said.
Moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsy suggested that Johnson had died as a result of a 'positional suffocation'.
A second autopsy, however, has given rise to another cause of death, according to Moore.
"There are a number of questions to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if there was sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he would order the FBI to carry out the investigation.
A representative of the County Sheriff's administration was not immediately ready to comment on our request on Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia ordered on Wednesday that the authorities release all surveillance videos that the investigators have reviewed.
The teen’s parents said they hoped that the video records contained clues as to how he died.
Publish allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for handling food allergies of children at schools.
These are the first such guidelines that the US government has issued, as the number of school-leaving children with food allergies is increasing.
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
The spread of food allergies among children has increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools designed to raise awareness of food allergies among teachers and employees and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine in stock – the auto injection of the EpiPen brand is most commonly used – in order to be able to encounter a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
Lawmakers in the states have recently changed the rules so that schools can keep Epinephrin more readily in stock.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, "It feels like something's pressing my tongue," "My tongue feels like a hair is on it" or "my tongue is writting".
Parents of intersexual children can choose "Wickedness Undecided"
Germany is the first European nation in which a third gender is recognised for children born with undisputed genitals.
Infants are no longer assigned rigidly male or female.
Under the new law, parents no longer have to explain gender to such children, but can indicate "undetermined" or "undetermined" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure of parents so that they do not have to make rash decisions in relation to surgery for a sex assignment in newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersexual people.
According to BBC, an intersexual person said years later: "I am neither man nor woman."
I'm still stuck with the patchwork that's been created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one out of 2,000 children is not born every year as a boy or as a girl.
They belong to the intersexual, a group that falls under the diagnosis of ‘sexual differentiation disorder’ (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (eggs or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most US experts recommend using the best available information on gender assignment if a provision is not possible and not waiting for the psychological and physical development of the child before deciding – if at all – for an operation.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the problem of gender identification, said that the new German law “sounds after a good thing”.
Intersexual children represent an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery, but most children don't," he said.
You can do a sex assignment without surgery and then wait for the identity to develop.
The scientific data on how a child develops his or her sexual identity is not very accurate.
Nobody knows why it happens.
It's like the secret that people are homosexuals.
In a 2011 report to the European Commission, it states that intersexual people are distinct from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not gender-related, but because of their biological constitution, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically both simultaneously or not clearly defined as one of them.
These properties were manifested in inferior sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, stamina, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination that cross-sex and transgender people are exposed to in their working lives, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Not matching with the gender picture boys now have a special camp.
In Australia and Nepal it is now possible for adults to indicate on official documents male, female or "third" sex.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world's first "unsex" person after a court granted lifelong maintenance of an "undetermined" gender status.
In addition to M and W, German licences will have a third allocation, X for intersexuals, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France gender trends are still controversial, such a news release to France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French members of the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that the "sex theory" should be removed from school books.
The U.S. Catholic Online website has also spoken against German law, stating: "If the world is torn into a new state, where the sex is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we turn two more pillars of civilization."
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to Baby Zone that she was better off when babies were assigned to a gender at birth.
"Parenthood is already stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you don't know your own child's gender," she said to the parents' website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female genders were called Hermaphrodites, according to the attractive Greek God, who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, medicine considered gender to be something that could be extinguished and then rebuilt.
But in the meantime, the ethical foundations of an operation are called into question, since now it is known how complex the sexual identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong, because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the gender assigned by them.
"In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a "psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
If such a child was born, you didn't call the psychiatrist, you called the surgeon.
The dominant theory of the treatment of children with unobtrusive genitals dates back to Dr. John Money from Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender was moldable.
He coined the term "sex identity" and argued, social and environmental offenses – as parents raise a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and shaped whether a person was considered male or female.
But in a case known as John/Joan from 1966, his theories became controversial.
He advised a boy's parents, whose penis had been cut off in a mischievous circumcision, to castrate the child completely and also remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, but it was not," Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he returned to the male sex and married a woman.
At 38 he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
However, in the 1990s, with the introduction of the Internet, survivors of these sex operations have entered the public, which are 'not happy with the result'.
Like Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, who was born with XY-male chromosomes, but he had two distinct genitals.
The doctors were not aware of whether he had a big clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never live a "satisfying life" as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he explained to ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at my birth – and nobody ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After learning the truth, he changed again to male identity, received testosterone injections and had his breasts removed.
The operation made him infertile.
Today, he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project for intersexual people to be perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, Managing Director of the Law Group Advocates for Informed Choice in California, is concerned that the German law could "encourage stamping and stigmatizing".
“Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and to assign a ‘not fixed’ to the child,” she said.
We fear that this will favour interventions.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we still don't know how the law will work, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law, because "it allows adults to be recognized as third-generation".
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender," she explained.
The German law is about the allocation at birth.
This is not a fight to force small children at this time.
When they are grown up, they can decide for themselves about their bodies.
However, Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburg, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says the German law "allows" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgenic resistance.
Due to the recipe effect of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee of the children's psychiatry.
Although it is infertile, it hopes to have a child through adoption or a lemming.
"The law gives parents space, so that they don't have to make decisions overwhelmly," Baratz said.
It gives them time to do different tests and clarify things and thus give them time before they write "male" or "female".
In this way everything is fine – you raise the child and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and you enjoy parental happiness.
And you don't have to overtake an operation that can't be undone anymore.
"This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are driving because they feel they are not doing the right thing," she explained.
Finally, the child decides about the gender that fits better with him – and that is wonderful.
This enables children to make their own decision.
Unknown injured girl by shooting from car
Unknown people have injured a twelve-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt in shootings from a car.
The perpetrators probably fired a group of children on Thursday evening in Genthin with an air pressure weapon.
The police told me about this in Burg.
The girl was easily injured on the left Wade.
Rescuers brought the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A slice broke.
Then they drove away.
The criminal police found out it was called Friday.
Until now, the police inspection Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
Officials were called only twice to cast children, who threw them at house façades.
Since the homeowners recognized this in time and immediately removed the Eierste, no material damage should have arisen either.
Furthermore, some Sylvesterböller were also lit in the city area, but also here no damage was caused.
A resident in the Bischof-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped with toilet paper and his wheel slides were removed.
Until the police arrived, however, the man found his wheel slides in close proximity all of them again, which is why the police did not have to continue their activity.
Living with a Future Perspective
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives in a dreamlike way.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery, an old tree stock, nice neighbours and also not too much traffic.
In the city there are only a few minutes by public transport.
"I hope you're not afraid of spiders?" asked Waltraud Ries and pointed to a fat spider on the door frame.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time.
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not spider phobia, but the concern about not being able to handle the many stairs to the house and the apartment at an age, she explains.
In addition: Since a Meniskus operation, the fifty-fifth woman has had to learn on her own body what it means to move with the handicap of floorwork to floorwork.
Only recently a book of hers has appeared on the topic 'Happy Living at Age - Which type of living is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what is not going on at all', she begins to tell.
When she moved with her husband to the Maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green.
Today with mid-fifties Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
But she also knows that she is one of the few people who even deal with the theme of 'living in old age'.
Most people get away with it as long as it's okay.
Old age is always just the others', she says muttering.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great do you think.
'Then it can be too late, too,' Ries said.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 living models for a self-determined living at the age.
'What form of living you choose, however, is always an individual decision', she explains.
D i e solution does not give it for age.
Even those who can afford the old age rest in Tuscany or Brittany should always think that he too can get sick.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the country's language, one also combines in the Dolce Vita,' the professional book author gives thought to aliens.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative living forms or the often quoted pensioner WG.
At age, everyone has his ticks and Macken
'For me, such a community would be nothing,' she said with a blindfold.
Not at all like a student WG with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
'You just need your retreat rooms at an age', Ries says.
Nevertheless, the book author does not want to exclude the fact that a community of senior citizens can work.
This would then have to be different from that of the classic student WG.
And sometimes you just want his rest, too, she thinks.
With this opinion, she is not alone in the capital city at least.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the civic service living at the age of the state capital.
Your department advises people on the topic of 'becoming older'.
Therefore, even older people would often also take on inconveniences and limitations, only to stay in their usual environment, which is also the experience of the Warentest Foundation.
Today, there are many ways to make the house or apartment accessible.
Ries recommends that all those who are concerned with the remodeling of their home or their apartment be informed and not to hire the first craftsman.
Today there are also specialists for the age-appropriate conversion.
Even in the apartment you let it be realized one or another, and if it's only the toilet seat increase, the interior designer clears up.
But it is not always possible to reorganize the existing apartment in an age-right and accessible way, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to make Waltraud Ries.
You could install a staircase lift inside the apartment, which also paved the way to the door of the apartment, but that would be a far greater obstacle.
It will continue to search until it has found the ideal object for itself and her husband.
Before moving, she was digging more than before the spider at her apartment door.
US wants to continue to persecute Snowden
The United States has not changed its attitude to former U.S. intelligence officer Edward Snowden.
He will continue to be accused of misrepresenting secret information.
That's why he had to make a criminal case in the United States, said the U.S. State Secretary Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
Nor would Snowden's recent statements change anything.
Previously, after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, the German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the USA not to further threaten him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that it was a matter of criticism of a parliamentarian rather than of a German member of the government.
Secret Service Gate Edward Snowden is in principle ready for a conversation with German authorities.
First, however, he wants to know his situation.
This was made clear by the former NSA staff member, who was sought by the United States, in an unaddressed letter published by the Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded it to the Federal Government, the Bundestag and the Federal Attorney General.
The following text is inserted after a translation which is widely distributed by the group:
Subjects
I was asked to write to you about your investigation on mass surveillance.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and I was formerly contractually or through a direct appointment as technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I became a witness to systematic violations of my government, which led me to act out of moral duty.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw myself exposed to a severe and persistent hatred that forced me to leave my family and my home.
I am currently living in exile and enjoying temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the US and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and also senior officials - including the United States - have judged disclosures to be a system of universal surveillance, which is not accountable to anyone as a service to the public.
These espionage revelations drew many suggestions on new laws and directives aimed at the formerly concealed abuse of public confidence.
The benefits to society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear; at the same time, the risks taken up were significantly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat Dissement as a fidelity and strives to criminalise political opinion and to prosecute it.
Yet: Proclaiming the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will take this demeanor.
I hope that, when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved, I will be able to take part in the responsible clarification of the facts in relation to the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports, appropriately and legally.
I am looking forward to a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for their efforts to preserve the international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden testified by Hans-Christian Ströbele
Kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Mayor Michael Maier.
The former kindergarten in the garden street has sold the municipality to a private person.
The local council agreed to the sale in its recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner at a "reasonable" price.
"The community is satisfied," said Maier.
In the budget, EUR 100 000 were employed.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the previous kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen has handed over responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter, and therefore no longer has to stand up for the entertainment of the house, such as heating, looking at the garden and clearing the walkway.
"This effort is now gone," Maier is pleased.
Place concentrate at summer temperatures
The Musikverein Hammereisbach gives a place concert on the terrace of the guest house Hammer.
When conductor Bianca Willmann lifts the clock at 7.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
Some 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammrich musicians.
The chairman, Manuela Honeck, explains the pieces.
In this context, Honeck thanked all those who had helped to successfully cope with the first music shock.
Report: Obama campaign considered replacing bids with Hillary Clinton
The closest adviser to President Barack Obama considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign, according to the New York Times.
The disclosure is the most remarkable surprise of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's long awaited work on the 2012 election campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times is a copy of the book soon to be published, and on Thursday evening she reported that the president's top advisors had carried out “extreme group meetings and polls at the end of 2011” to find out if Obama's falling hope of re-election would be better if he dropped bids.
According to Jonathan Martin, National Political Correspondent of the Times, the book thoroughly illustrates the history of the efforts of leading campaign and White House employees, namely the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the impact it has on the survey values of the former Foreign Minister Clinton on the vice president.
The potential change was a strictly protected secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president's closest advisers – including Daley, the former campaign leader Obama, Jim Messina, and the former leading consultant of the White House, David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the planned change.
The 'Double Down' claims that Daley was at the forefront of the efforts to exchange bids despite her 'neighbourly personal relationship' before deciding against such a move, after the data showed that the candidate Clinton would 'not significantly improve Obama's chances'.
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing bids with Clinton.
"I said a number of things to consider, and that was one of them," said Daley to the magazine.
It must be remembered that the President had terrible polls at the time, so we thought, "For God's will, what do we do?"
While Daley referred to the investigations as "precautionary care", Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that during the campaign for re-election, considerable effort had been made to find out whether such a move would pay off in terms of the polls.
"The campaign doesn't spend so much money on polls and focus groups unless you think seriously about something," said Martin at AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss at the time had known about the potential change.
Although Daley stated that he did not believe that the President of the possible change was "conscious", the former Chief of Staff admitted that it was "possible" that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that 'Double Down' did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political probes had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama knew nothing about the investigations about whether to drop bids in the elections.
"Possible," Martin replied.
What happens to my e-mail?
E-mail is actually an electronic letter.
Was the e-mail technically implemented in the design of the Internet service, similar to that of the conventional mail?
In the design of early Internet services, the focus was on making communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols did not ensure that a stable foundation was created for an ear-proof letter exchange.
Therefore, a conventional email corresponds to an open postcard rather than a sealed letter.
If the user "Anna" sends an e-mail to "Benni", are the two computers directly connected?
Anna's e-mail program or browser sends the e-mail to the mail server of her service provider in the first step.
For example, if she has a GMail account, Google would.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the route the mail can run via several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call his provider.
Are conventional emails being read on their way through the web?
Most mails are read on the way several times by software robots.
With the sender’s provider, it is usually checked whether the mail leads to a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is a annoying and unwanted spam mail that is immediately deleted or at least sorted out into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
For systems like GMail, the robot also determines the information that Google needs to place context advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate via Gmail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can show appropriate links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read the e-mails?
The likelihood that unauthorized persons will read an e-mail is extremely low.
But theoretically, that's possible.
In companies, administrators often have the possibility to read e-mail.
The law enforcement authorities and secret services also have legal opportunities to intercept or take note of e-mails.
In addition, possible illegal outreach measures are included.
Is it possible to protect e-mails from sharing?
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an e-mail can be encrypted effectively by co-reading.
With high technical effort, it is also possible to mask the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not even possible to easily recognize who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the email market in Germany?
According to a survey by Convios Consulting from August 2013, Yahoo and Google play only a minor role in the mainly privately used mailboxes.
While the shares of Yahoo mail had fallen last, GMail was able to increase significantly by Google.
Mother shaves in the forest and collects pension
When his old mother died, a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to cash her pension and care allowance.
In order to pay further pension and care allowance, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother in the forest after investigation by the police.
First, he hid the death of the 89-year-olds, then he cancelled the money for more than one and a half years.
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud, as one speaker said on Friday.
The man then hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected already in May: at that time, it occurred that no medication was needed for the needy mother.
The investigator told the pensioner that his mother had travelled to Spain.
Because this occurred strangely to officials, they continued to determine.
It turned out that for more than 15 years the two had lived in a common apartment and he had last maintained it.
The 67-year-old finally granted the death of his mother.
According to the police, an autopsy revealed no evidence of a capital crime.
Want ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first ice that shines in the dark – with the help of jellys.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a luminous leak.
The idea came to him after he had read a research on jellyfish and had been able to convince Chinese scientists to produce the glowing protein artificially.
The ice cream reacts when eating with the tongue, thus raising the pH in the protein and triggering the light.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the heat in the mouth and shines – the more you lick, the lighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value.
When the mouth warms up the protein, the pH rises and the ice shines.
We have tested it in recent months and it seemed ideal to bring it to the market on Halloween, because it has this wonderful lighting effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the jelly light is four times more expensive than gold.
Each bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes delicious.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and leaf gold.
But his latest creation is to become even more ambitious.
He says: 'I would like to develop an invisible ice cream'.
This is impossible on and on itself because of the light cracking caused by the ice crystals, which consist of ice cream; but I suspect we will find a way to create it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jelly that is artificially produced by Chinese scientists
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball League after six days of playing.
Calculated now, the team of Ingo Ehlers will arrive tomorrow at the Derby against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game the season starts again for us.
"I hope we're finally freeing our heads," Ehler's behavior is optimistic.
At last, with the exception of Hendrik Blohme, he has at his disposal his complete cadre.
Daverden is also setting the way we are at the pace.
We must therefore keep our error rate low.
First of all, however, it is important to increase in the coverage, which has at last left everything other than a safe impression.
Daverden's coach Thomas Panitz won the first season against Nordhorn.
The game was of course a house number.
But that's why we're not the favorite for a long time, because everything can always happen in Derby.
However, Panitz now wants to leave in Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat is missing.
For this the A-Jugendliche Joost Windsfuß, who is active with double-play law at the A-Jugend-Bundesligist HC Bremen, celebrates his seasonal debut.
Whoever is not hot in such a game should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay late and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today I've become a Halloween muffler.
Over the last two years, I have not declared myself prepared to distribute my home from sweets and will probably not do so this year either.
But according to statistics, I'm a black sheep as far as Halloween is concerned.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be precise – celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes and decorations, says the U.S. Federation of Retailers (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween, though, is the trend values.
Costumes will amount to about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, exciting inanimate objects are the last scream.
Women no longer have to cover themselves in sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft Punk Spacemen will make it into Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most sought after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with tradition.
We disguised our dogs last year and were not alone with this to my amazement.
In fact, Americans spend 330 million dollars this year on costumes of their pets, says the NRF.
That is a lot of 'hot dogs'.
As far as sweets are concerned, we are not whimsical.
Americans will spend 1.9 billion dollars this year, says The Nielsen Company.
That's about 270 million kilograms of chocolates, lucerne, candy and rubber bears.
So good news for the 41 million people, according to the US Department of Commerce, who move through the neighborhood with the saying 'sweet or sour'.
In fact, we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let's not imagine – eat.
The only thing we don't want to consume is Candy Corn, but 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of Sweetheart Manufacturers.
That's about nine billion corn grains.
It's a mystery I couldn't solve.
Nothing is more of Halloween than houses where it spits.
They have great names such as 'Terror Behind the Walls' (which, by the way, is in a real prison), 'Howl-O-Scream' and 'The House of Shock'.
There are, in fact, 1,200 officially recognized ghost houses in the United States that earn 500 million dollars, says America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos on which you just pee in your pants and put the friends on Facebook, where you won't get rid of them again, and then one of the guy you're standing on leaves a comment like "no face."
But let's finally get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown was familiar with the big pumpkin when we were kids, and cutting a pumpkin is like decorating the Christmas tree – something we've made up of little.
Fortunately, last year the “baby in the pumpkin” trend started with Pinterest, so that most of us grew up cutting the pumpkin and not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about 106 million dollars on pumpkins, says the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern, which slowly rotted in the front garden, probably originates from Illinois, where this year 245 million kilograms of pumpkin were harvested.
If you want to score correctly, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and cut a little nice from their 921 kilo of heavy pumpkin.
Home fire in Helmbrechts: Rescue forces mount charred corpses
The fire brigade had to go to Helmbrechts on the late Thursday evening.
A three-family house in the Hof district captures the night to Friday fire.
The rescue forces have a cold body from the house.
Rescue forces have found a charred body in a three-family house at a fire in Helmbrechts.
Whether it is a resident is still unclear, as a police spokesperson in Bayreuth said.
On the late Thursday evening it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the fire brigade arrived, the flames were already beating out of a window.
The operatives went to the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned out completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spoke up.
The building was not habitable for the time being.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany's largest state church has started an offensive to advertise for the pastor's profession.
Background is a possible shortage of parishes: The Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Hanover expects the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors to halve by 2030 according to their current situation.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the course of work and the day itself.
With Burfien, for the first time, the Landeskirche has commissioned a pastor in a full position to inspire young people to study theology.
At the moment, fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology after graduation.
Burfien brings this back to the process of deconsecration: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud".
In doing so, the profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my calendar and can put my priorities where it is important to me.
Pastors could be very close to people as pastors.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well on it.
Of course, more money will be paid in the free economy, but theologians would have a safe employer.
This is true of the young people today, who are not only concerned with careers, but with work that is filled with meaning.
According to the Landeskirche, which consists of three quarters of Lower Saxony, about 60 pastors are now retired each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology study begin their vicariate.
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the resin, the Emland or the Wendland, it could become difficult to occupy places in the future.
Among other things, Burfien wants to organize study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
Theology studies offer a wide range of training.
You can even become the Federal President.
Land Rover Rally Series Announced
In the interior there are racing seats and six point belts as well as an open voice system.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with support from bowler workers mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: "The rally customers who come to bowlers have changed."
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as a accessible way to world-class events.
We are pleased to be able to open this way in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the different Rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and to prepare newcomers for the rigors and reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge-cars – this will be an entertaining championship.
In addition, there is a training and test day in February at the Defender Challenge as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighter called for the rescue of a bitch who was trapped 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock lead in a quarry
Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby had run away after a minor traffic accident
Three days later, she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in her miscarriage
Firefighters sailed on a rock wall and rescued the dog from safe death
The fire brigade managed to secure a bitch that was stuck on a 15 - foot - high protrusion in a rock wall.
The nine-month-old Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby had run away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20 to whom the dog belongs, came to the quarry Flapit in Denholme, West Yorkshire to receive Ruby and thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately been looking for their missing bitch and had published help calls in social networks when they had run out of the quarry after the small traffic accident.
Around 2:15 a.m. on Wednesday, a walker who carried out his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15-metre-high heel in the quarry.
The technical rescue team at Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the location and sailed to rescue Rubys, which was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, specialist in the technical rescue team, said: “She was in a dangerous position.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She did not move muscles during her rescue – she was like frozen steef.
But now she's fine.
After that, she ate a couple of dog biscuits.
That was a rather unusual use.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, specialist in the technical rescue team, said: "Ruby had a huge accident."
There was the possibility that she was very badly injured or worse.
Ruby was investigated as a veterinarian, but he found nothing but exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "Seeing salvation was frightening."
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep them back in their arms.
The veterinarian explained that if exhaustion had become too great and collapsed, it would probably have collapsed.
The firemen have done great things.
It was really brave what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: "We were afraid she would fall down, but she stayed up."
The firemen were great.
I can hardly believe where she was.
Mick Jagger says he never touched Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she worked as a background singer for Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard".
Perry said she had dinner with the old rocker for the evening, and that "he went to see me when I was 18".
She added: 'It has been a long time and he was very kind to me.'
In a statement, a representative of Mr Jaggers, 70, said on Thursday that he "concretely denied that he had ever tried to approach Katy Perry".
The representative added: "Maybe she confused him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance at the Rolling-Stones tour this year.
Her new album "Prism" landed on top of 1 this week.
George Kerevan: European Unbundling gives the Scots the choice
A new day, a new horror story about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is required to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a border secured with barbed wire along the Hadrian wall.
In fact, the Strathclyde presentation highlighted the potential economic benefits that would result in more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but this – as expected – did not play a role in the headlines.
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU Member States often comply with their strict rules if they are more favourable to them.
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, continued non-respect for Brussels would be only a small concession in return for what you really want from the Scots.
So, actually, no story.
And one that has already come in such years that she is already like a fossil: The first time I have heard the “independence means passport checks”-ends at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history.
Why should it be expected from an independent Scotland that it dances after the European pipe?
Why exchange the London Joch against that of Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great plan to unite Europe after the war has come to the fore.
With the euro crisis, the project Europe officially died.
All over the EU, parties who are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro overboard as a Community currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Party has been able to make an alternative for Germany – only founded this year – almost five million votes in the Bundestag elections in September and thus effectively expel the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
The current economic crisis, however, appears to be a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity policies imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the coercive jacket in which the respective national economy is required by holding on to the single currency, many people believe that the project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – that was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has committed its members to exchange rates that are favourable to German exporters – and that is what German politicians like to let them.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency, South Europe can be found with a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – encouraged by Berlin.
There is a deeper European productivity problem behind current budget and currency problems.
As a result of the 'green' energy directives imposed by Brussels – a code for the subsidisation of French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice for electricity and four times for gas compared to the United States.
This is a paralysing cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
The European petrochemical industry does not protect the world from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt is rising, especially in France, the former EU cheerleader.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle with which to keep Germany in check and raise Paris to the height of Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimisation, and Europe has relegated its own economic policy, with which the attacked French economy has to fight.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing leader, EU enemy front National has just won a decisive post-election and thus the ruling socialists have put in third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of voters – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a division in the right spectrum would automatically mean advantages for the left.
What does Le Pen do with its newly won popularity among the white French of the working class?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties cut off well in these elections – and that is very possible – then for the first time such a block could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I would like to add: in the not too distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will come together for the abolition of the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will rather become something like the 'Europe of the (Sovereign) Nations', favored by General de Gaulle.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may be holding onto the euro, but France and Southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering itself with the US.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific region suggests that Britain alone will stand in the Atlantic rain.
Where does Scotland stay with all this?
We can decide to be a region of (in the last consequence) Klein-England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including Berlin and Brussels – what they can say.
I believe that Scotland could go quite well in a relaxed European union, provided we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other, similar, thinking countries is easier in a non-fed Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider keeping Norway equal and our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkablely – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and made) cuts that the Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem Coalition had to take responsibility.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide for independence now, only to be forced by Berlin and Brussels to have an austerity policy.
Early Puberty: Growing up faster
African and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers, as studies show.
Physical changes do not directly mean puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in young people
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family themes.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter grows breasts and sham hair at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics Children's Medical Association this week in Orlando, Florida, paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a new standard.
“I spend a lot of time calming parents – this is usually not a sign that the puberty is now entering the puberty quickly,” Kaplowitz explained.
Obviously displays of the development, such as growing breasts, shame and shoulder hair, as well as body smell, are seen in girls earlier.
Nevertheless, there has been only a slight shift at the age of the Menarche (the occurrence of the first rule bleeding) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When the development of the breasts begins, it takes for at least two to three years to reach the Menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book, "early puberty for girls: the essential adviser to deal with this frequent problem".
Time is the most accurate test how puberty progresses.
It is controversial, which is actually the beginning of puberty, but it is true that the breast enlargement is accompanied by a period of growth before the age of eight years.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something a pediatrician can monitor closely.
If rapid progress is made, tests by an endicronologist may be shown so that serious problems such as tumours or cysts can be ruled out.
There are treatment methods to delay an early menstrual period and to ward off another episode: premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for therapeutic or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is reluctant about drugs, but he admits: "The suppression of puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and the feelings of girls, unlike their peers."
The other big problem is understandable: parents just don't want their very young daughters to have the period.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygiene side," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter got her days with ten.
Although there were first signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came scared and excited from school home because she was the first one in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories on the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other food, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be the cause.
Boys come in puberty, just like girls used to.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the implementation of a 2001 study on girls aged six to nine years, which establishes a link between body fat and entry into puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country African and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white age comrades.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, an early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another mystery: Although boys are growing facial hair and shampooing earlier, the trend towards a full-scale earlier puberty is not as pronounced as with girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the topic.
The emergence of acne and shampoos is common even in babies and toddlers.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the true beginning of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to be advised by their pediatrician as to how to speak to their child.
"This may mean having a conversation sooner than expected," said Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who bloom early need insurance, which is the process a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than intended.
Jumbo manufacturers argue in the face of large orders over seat width
Between leading aircraft manufacturers, there has been a dispute over the width of tourist class seats for long-haul flights, indicating the tone for a bitter collision at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the seat width that passengers are offered for long flights in the tourist class – not always those that airlines are most concerned with, but this designated space represents the key to efficiency claims for the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. aircraft.
This week, Airbus called for an industry standard that requires a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the American archival Boeing says that airlines should decide.
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft builders compete to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft, and to expect record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November.
As the rear part of the aircraft is designed – especially if there are rows of nine or ten seats – is crucial for the declared economic results that will deliver the new "Mini-Jumbo" design.
Boeing claims to acquire its modernized '777X' 406 people at seats in the tourist class that are over 17 inches wide and thus allow ten per row.
Airbus explains the competing version of the A350 transporters 350 people in 18-inch seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aircraft giants often share high technical details by means of advertising in the specialist press.
Airbus now appeals to the public directly before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to make the race.
Recently, the company presented an advertisement that could be the beginning of a new ad war and showed money donors an image in which three people collided in a restaurant and the title: "Would you accept that?"
"Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats that are narrower than regional turbo-props," says Airbus Sales Manager John Leahy.
In view of changing dietary habits, people are getting thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing 747 defined the modern long-distance journey, and the end of the century, the weight of the male average American has increased by ten percent between 40 and 49 years, according to the US Department of Health.
The male average number of male Americans in the 21st century is 100.8 cm according to US health statistics.
Airbus says that his rival adhered to a 1950s seat concept when the average body size of the newly baptized Jet Set was narrower.
According to Airbus, studies have been carried out which showed that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increases sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing disputes the figures of Airbus to the seat dimensions and says that it is not in the discretion of the manufacturers to decide how airlines shape the balance between fares and equipment.
The company also explains that, according to investigations, the aircraft experience depends on more than its seat width.
"It is really important to give airlines flexibility so that they can do what they think they need to do in order to be successful," explains the cabin expert Kent Craver of Boeing.
They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
You know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers it is about more elbow freedom, but for manufacturers it becomes increasingly a topic that can affect sales.
A race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least US$700 billion at list prices over the coming decades is behind the debate, which could have a lasting impact on the export balance of the US or Europe.
As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the dispute over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-distance design than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seater Boeing 77-300ER.
The Boeings statements to the results partly depend on the 777X being compared with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased costs per unit are still lower than for existing machines with ten seats per row.
"Boeing therefore squeezes more seats in his aircraft to make it more competitive in our products," says Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s indicated that many passengers opted for the narrower arrangement, which could go hand in hand with cheaper air fares.
"A eighteen-inch seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is controlled by the 777 threat," says Mary Kirby, cabin facility expert, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world’s traveling jet sellers even carry a tape measure in order to measure the establishment in competition.
Even if they offer the comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with high-definition design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seater rows, but has not sold yet according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus has stressed how important more portability of cabins is and has offered some jets wide seats at the corridors.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the call for a new industry standard could probably be puffed but diverted from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could make smoking the Garaus a pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotin vaccine that could destroy the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Before tests on humans, further tests are needed, which may take a few more years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results are good.
"We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and have tried out all the methods available on the market, but had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches," says Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, whereby a smoker does not experience nicotine elevation.
In trials, vaccinated mice administered nicotine maintained their normal activity level.
On the other hand, mice would have taken a "vacation" without vaccination, the researchers explained a sign that the nicotine had reached its brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and impractical.
However, the cost of the new vaccine is probably significantly lower, as it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for people, if sure, could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
But more likely, smokers would use him to stop.
"You know, when they start smoking again, they feel no pleasure in it because of the nicotine vaccine, and this helps them to stop the habit," he explains.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi denied having been influenced by Obeid
Against the former minister of the Joe Tripodi Laboratory Party from New South Wales, an investigation is initiated by the State Corruption Supervisory Board.
The former NSW minister contests the amendment of the rules on maritime leasing at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who owned hidden holdings in three properties on state-controlled land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission Against Corruption) expanded its investigations on Friday to determine whether Obeid has influenced various ministers of state to extend leases at the Circular Quay, where the Obeids run two restaurants and a café without calling for tender after their expiry in August 2005.
Now is determined because of the accusation that Tripodi knew of Obeid's hidden interest in the land after Tripodi's former Deputy Chief of Staff Lynne Ashpole had declared on Thursday accordingly.
In years of discussions that began in 2005, the government had pressed public tender for the lease contracts.
The tenants were opposed and also wanted longer periods.
In 2009, the lease contracts for the companies at Circular Quay, which provided the Obeids with 2.5 million dollars a year, were renewed without public tender.
Tripodi, who was the Harbour Minister from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally voted for public procurement.
But he disagreed to have made the changes at the request of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had forced the government to redesign the lease arrangements.
One of the ICAC’s phone records showed conversations between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn from August and September 2007, a senior official who had been transferred to the port ministry after working under supervision of the fisheries authority.
'Where the topic discussed in this telephone conversation concerned the development of commercial leases,' asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Wheely Tripodi.
"No," replied Tripodi.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it was definitely not.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli fighter planes attack target in Syria, so official sources
Israeli fighters had attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, confirmed a senior government assistant to Fox News.
The official did not explain what the objective was, but said that it was at least one.
According to Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has already carried out air strikes on missile shipments in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to 'truth tests'
The government is thinking in the framework of extended measures on a 'truth test' for foreign workers with 457 visas.
Should the test be introduced, it would be applied through a criterion designed to prevent the 457 being used for the occupation of unqualified jobs or as a back door for the move of family and friends to Australia.
Today, a government discussion proposal was published after former members of the Labor Party, Maxine McKew, had condemned the government's comments on foreign workers because they could be treated as insults by Australia's neighbours.
“Higher declarations such as ‘Ausländer’s aim is to get behind’ and ‘Australiser first’ are a very unpleasant setback in times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market,” she said to the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, it was said that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region embody an echo of this historical artifact, I would not be surprised.
The discussion proposal outlines twelve measures once envisaged by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who spent yesterday talking about human smuggling in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still considering.
If the 'criterion of authenticity' is taken over, a person applying for a visa could be examined to see if 'the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting undertaking or is personally linked.'
Companies could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders after hundreds of companies in the past, who initially wanted to support only a small number of workers, eventually ceased to work.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylumant probably died of a heart attack after he arrived on the Christmas Island with a refugee boat this week.
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who came to Australia with him has been cared for by an adult cousin since the death of his father on Wednesday, who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital where he died.
A study was announced by the British Government to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to establish high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England as early as Phase 1 in 2026.
Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer said that the project 'will bring Britain closer together'.
Scottish transport minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
After Phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and northern England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The UK Government, which is in discussions with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacities and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel time of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that brings Britain and its cities closer together."
We are moving ahead with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish State Secretary Alistair Carmichael commented: "Today's announcement is a good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown Carmichael called for the use of 'incomprehensible' for the Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed rail connection holds the potential for enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but also provides Scotland's economic power an argument for fast rail connections throughout the UK."
We are therefore pleased to work as partners of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland, to create the benefits for everyone and to complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh link that the Scottish government is already planning.
I am looking forward to examining the study report with the British ministers next year and to taking the next steps together.
Regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian air passengers must continue to switch off tablets and smartphones when starting and landing, despite efforts in the US to loosen the rules for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their specifications so that passengers on their devices can read, view or play videos during critical flight phases, provided they are in flight mode.
During most of the flight, passengers are already allowed to do this, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books when starting and landing.
Australian companies are monitoring the decision to implement the U.S. airlines’ redundancies in work, but do not pursue immediate plans to change their rules.
The CASA Air Traffic Management Authority also stated that it would look at the announcement, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical flight phases in Australia still apply.
"The CASA does not currently have specific rules on the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft", it has been stated.
The subject is subject to rules requiring airlines to maintain safety at any time and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by cabin crew.
Virgin has already conducted talks with the CASA on the extension of his Wi-Fi entertainment system to flights and explains that you are open to change, but these should be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we are now offering (wireless entertainment) during the flight," said one speaker.
Qantas said that you will remain in the current regulations until further notice.
"Our current guidelines provide that electronic devices may not be used at start-up and landing, and we do not currently have plans to change that," said the company.
The FAA rules apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers, and will certainly take a close look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision has different effects on American companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate the radio interferences caused by mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, hand baggage programs and customer instruction.
"After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lighter electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height," the FAA announced.
In rare cases with a poor view, the crew will show the passengers while landing the equipment.
The group also recommended storing heavier equipment safely under the seat or in the compartments above the seats when starting and landing.
In front of the Revierderby against Schalke, riders with light rockets had provided for ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced severe consequences.
Before the Friday game of the football federal league against VfB Stuttgart, the ultras reacted with a silence - first.
It was an unusual, almost already spastic acoustic, which offered the viewer up to shortly before the beginning of the Bundesliga game between the German vice-master Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna Park.
Most of the guests were heard with their songs.
The South Tributes, on the other hand, where the most faithful of the faithful - and loudest - BVB fans stood, initially presented themselves extraordinarily silently: no songs, no battle calls.
The podium of the Capo, who otherwise coordinated the joint incitement, remained unoccupied.
And at the very front of the gallery, a large flag with the inscription "Sektion Stadionverbane" was hurting.
Only as a goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller as always as the first BVB player entered the square, was short-term cheering.
When his teammates followed, there was loud singing and wailing scarves - but not everywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Tribune nothing worked.
Even that stadium speakers Norbert Dickel listed the positive experiences of the last days - Derbysieg, victory over Arsenal, extension of the contract by coach Jürgen Klopp - did not ensure celebration.
Only five minutes before the apex, the Capo climbed his podium - and the tension that so far can be grasped with hands escaped in a loud scream, when Dickel as usual asked the mood on the ranks of the stadium.
The last thing was like always the South Tributes on the row - and finally here was again as usual the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest when with Anpfiff from the South Tribune the loud call "Derby victor stands up" came, everything was again as always.
The silence before that was probably a reaction to the events of the past days.
Immediately before Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of BVB's compliant trailers had fired light rockets into the crowds and fired into the square - and almost hit Torhüter Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was staged late because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had then received the tops of Dortmunder Ultras in his office - and is believed to be Watzke's words, this was a rather tireless appointment for the fan representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra-movement," announced the BVB boss on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke prohibited the Ultras from choreography for the home game against VfB Stuttgart.
"I've forbidden that," he said.
We cannot abandon the zero-tolerance policy in the field of pyrotechnology.
In addition, the ultras were shown various ways of punishment - until Tuesday these now have time to decide for one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, the BVB will impose a penalty by the end of next week.
"This will be intrusive," assured Watzke.
One may be tense as the reactions to the South Tribune then turn out.
Peanuts are booming in Singapore, as the crisis has arrived in the middle class
In a pawn shop in the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalena exchanges a golden bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay the school fees of her daughters.
"My husband and I just bought a house, there's all my money in there," says Amirtühlunga.
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars each month (about 1,730 euros) as an administrative assistant and also works for her husband, the monthly family income is not sufficient, she explains.
Indeed, the demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where the debt of households increases – is so great that ValueMax, where she made her exchange, became this week the third Pandhaus listed on the Singapurian Stock Exchange.
The pledge of jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalena – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, mortgages in Singapore demand an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, which is just over 15.4 percent that the United Overseas Bank demands, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, mortgages offer the advantage that there is no need to review the creditworthiness or income evidence here, which is why loans are possible faster than in banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region are turning to peacock houses, after families feel pressure from rising cost of living as well as increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a relaxed fiscal policy in the developed economic areas, families with lower and medium-sized incomes are looking to compensate for the difference in the stuttering economy.
This week, the Rating Agency designated Standard & Poor's growing household debt, mainly by increasing mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore, according to the Agency, have the highest household debt in Asia relative to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
Economic operators are also concerned about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which this week barely came out of a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed a continued weakness in exports and a decline in consumer demand.
"In the final effect, this means that in view of rising costs, people in the middle to lower segments (the income scale) will try to complement their income wherever possible," says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical peaks in gold prices over the past two years have reinforced the trend towards the pledge of personal items, as people take advantage of the opportunity to turn the family jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the objects pledged are in the 200 pawn houses of the City State of Gold.
People say, "The gold price looks good, let's pledge Grandmother's gold chain and get back next month."
The largest Thai mortgage operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20 percent growth in its branches in recent months.
The growth in the deposit business is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore, wants not only to expand into the neighbouring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, according to Yeah Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company finances this with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars it took with the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
While some lenders have entered the crossfire because of high interest rates, Yeah explains that mortgages not only offer cheaper interest rates than other lenders, but also did not directly increase the debt.
"Customers borrow items they already own and the liquefying of personal valuables does not increase household education," she explains.
The mortgage lending business is increasingly accepted in society as a short-term, secured financing.
Nor are not all people who use mortgages in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to the stores of ValueMax to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers come to us from every social layer.
"This includes well-being who borrows something for a business or an investment in the short term, or small companies that have to bridge the bottlenecks in the cash flow," says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA extracts data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The intelligence enthüller Edward Snowden has in principle an interest in helping Germany to clarify the ever-brightening NSA pea business.
Following the presentation of Hans-Christian Ströbele, a member of the Green Bundestag, was concerned at his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia about the conditions under which the ex-secretarial staff at a German Public Prosecutor's Office or a committee of inquiry would declare.
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele said the ARD magazine "Panorama".
Rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian healthcare
The Australian government is based on the harsh conditions associated with the bailout package of more than 325 million Australian dollars for the Tasmanian health care system to ensure that the government of the state cannot waste the money.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek has announced that Commonwealth will take 'imminent measures' to avoid a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and system restrictions.
The financing for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has curtailed an emergency rescue package which, in our view, addresses the unique challenges facing the state," said Plibersek today.
The 325-million dollar package includes 31 million dollars emergency aid for election services.
Another 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic surgery and treatment for grey star, are intended to eliminate residues.
In addition, there is money for day care clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare for permanent stays, specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the ideas I have been told by the hospital staff concerned that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability from the Tasmanian Government.
The state had to maintain the current level of funding in order to obtain money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member Commission will be set up to ensure that health services are provided as effectively and efficiently as possible by the State.
As Mr Wilkie said today, the 325 million dollars would be of little use if 'they were not accompanied by real reforms that bring the public health system to a more sustainable course.'
Despite this, he praised the government for having responded to his request for urgent assistance, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
"I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to taking the public health system of the state from the care list," Wilkie said.
According to the government of the state, these elections will largely make up for recent cuts.
But the health spokesman of the opposition at federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that today's announcement is just a 'plaster solution'.
"We are therefore in a position today because the Labor government has deducted $430 million from the health system," he said to ABC TV.
It can't be that a state government pulls half a billion dollars out of the system and puts in the Commonwealth 300 million and then pretends to be the good news.
Dutton requested Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package will be spent for additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux' adaptation of the novel by Denis Diderot convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but is also more expensive than necessary.
The action of the 1760s in France tells the gripping story of Suzanne, a young nobleman sent by her family to the monastery.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superior and becomes the object of erotic fascination with another.
The film never slips into obscurity or sensationalism – and that's its problem.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told also makes him a tormenting beaner's shirt for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons, such as a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed important chemical weapons and gas ammunition production facilities, explained the Global Chemical Weapons Monitoring Group on Thursday, while serious clashes occurred in the north of the country near one of the locations where potentially toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war three years ago.
The announcement of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day before the date on
1 November, which the Damascus organization located in The Hague had put in place to destroy all chemical weapons production facilities or to make them "inoperative", including all machinery for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling ammunition.
The conclusion of this process, which is essentially the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone of an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all Syria's chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the institutions means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, still needs to begin by destroying the existing weapons and supplies.
According to assumptions, there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and the nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when battles took place on Thursday in Safira City, the experts say that there is a production facility for chemical weapons as well as deposits, as the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, based in Great Britain, announced.
The activists' group, which is tracking the number of dead through a network of activists in Syria, stated on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the side of the government were 29,954 of them the army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 being government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead were 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 fighters of the opposition, many of them foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN estimated the number of dead in this conflict since March 2011 to 100,000.
This figure has not yet been updated.
The conflict forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting for weeks in Sapphira against the rebels, many of whom have connections to al-Qaeda groups.
The observatory said that there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not mention any details.
The struggles underline the danger posed by the chemical weapons inspectors, because their mission to liberate Syria from its poisonous arms arsenal is a race against the time of a blazing civil war.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team was “now convinced that it has seen all the important production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned by Syria and experienced its destruction.”
Therefore, 'no further inspection activities are planned at present.'
At the beginning of the week, the inspectors had declared that they had completed the first round of inspections and visited 21 out of 23 sites listed by Damascus.
Because of safety concerns, the visit of two institutions was not possible, said the inspectors.
On Thursday, the OPWC stated that the two sites had been "repealed ... and the objects of the chemical weapons programme there had been transferred to other named facilities inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Sappira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons to be approved by the Executive Committee of the OPWC next month.
"I draw the hat from the bravery and courage shown by all of you in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization," said Ahmed Uzumcu, Director-General of the OPCW, in a comment published by OPCW.
For the past three years, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels in this civil war have been fighting against Assad's government and its security forces, many of which are members of the Alawites, a division of Shiite Islam.
With regard to further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said that on Wednesday there was a strong explosion in an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion was not known, he explained.
Angry of Judgment for Bombers of Bali
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who had died in 2002 at the bombing in Bali reacted indignantly to the verdict for the last of the instigators who were brought before the court, since Umar Patek was to be shot in their view of their stand.
Patek, who was on the run almost ten years ago as one of the most sought-after South-East Asians, was sentenced to a 20-year imprisonment for his role in the construction of explosives for the bombing.
He could be released with a sentence after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many others were injured.
In addition, a series of terrorist charges took place, including a wave of bombings on churches in Indonesia on Holy Evening in 2000.
The prosecution had called for a life sentence, even if it was for the man who, because of his reputation as a master bomber, is also called 'Demolition Man', who could have claimed the death penalty.
The decision has aroused painful memories at June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin daughter Jane and Jenny in the blight of Patek and his co-conspirators nearly ten years ago.
Fighting with tears, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"You should put him in front of a shootout command," Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day so I don't get another grandson and I'll never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was leveled to the ground when a huge bomb exploded in a small truck parked in front of the nightclub shortly after 23 o'clock on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber exploded a backpack filled with explosives.
He fell into the coma for one month after the attack and died three times while he was on a life support system.
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terror cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy was supposed to get the death penalty before everyone else.
Let him live – no, there is no reason to let him live.
20 years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds, is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to stand in court.
In January 2011, he was arrested in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces killed the former al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden just four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent stated that intelligence reports had provided the indication that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the goal of rebuilding the connection between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
"He didn't sit down," said Corteen.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for how much suffering he has caused to other people.
The verdict was made before the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which is celebrated in Bali and Australia with commemorative celebrations.
"There will be many tears this year," said Corteen.
Patek can still appeal against his judgment.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but don't have phone calls)
Air travelers can now use their electronic devices for reading, working, playing, music and watching movies from departure to landing, but not by phone, according to the new guidelines published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the USA.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
As soon as they were implemented, depending on the respective airline, FAA staff Michael Huerta explained at a press conference.
Air carriers must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated flight crew training manuals and equipment stowage regulations in accordance with the new regulations.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
"According to the state of the plan, we could approve the advanced use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA announced in a statement.
Passengers currently need to turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They may not start them again until the plane reaches a height of three kilometres and gives the captain green light.
When entering the landing flight, passengers must switch them off again and not be allowed to start them again before the aircraft has landed.
According to the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the equipment even when starting, landing and on the rolling field, said the FAA.
Most new transport aircraft and other aircraft that have been upgraded for use of Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the professional airline association, welcomed the changes.
"If the new regulation is implemented safely – and we work closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit from it," said Glading.
To be honest, we are sorry to have to feel like custodians on this issue.
Nevertheless, Internet connections for surfing, exchanging e-mails, text messages or downloading data below three kilometres were still prohibited, the authority explained.
Passengers are invited to put smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.
So still no "Words With Friends", the Scrabble-like online game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011, when he had to leave a jet from American Airlines in public because he refused to switch off the device while the plane was parked on the flywalk.
And heavier devices like laptops also need to be stowed, as there is a risk of injury if they are flying through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight are also still banned.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
FAA may prohibit certain electronic devices on take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker said by the National Transportation Safety Board, safety expert for national traffic issues on CBS News, mobile phones would still be considered a risk.
"Handy is really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause interference with navigational devices, but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also interfere with transmitters," says Rosenker.
A industry advisory committee, launched by the FAA to investigate this issue, recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic equipment.
In recent years, pressure on the FAA has increased to relieve restrictions on use.
Critics, such as Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri, express the view that there are no valid safety grounds for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the equipment has become ubiquitous.
In some studies, there is talk that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the switch-off of the device.
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic equipment by air travellers after reports of interference of navigation and communication equipment by passengers had become known to VHF radios, which were the latest technology trend at that time.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that they do not constitute electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for several years when the altitude is reached.
The flyers adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interferences.
According to Huerta, the vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the increased use of electronic equipment according to the new guidelines.
Today's electronic equipment generally emits much less radiation than previous generations.
E-Reader, for example, only emit minimal radiation if you turn over.
But when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are stronger.
Among the defenders of a relaxation of restrictions on the use of equipment by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, company staff ran a passenger aircraft full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to identify problems, but could not detect.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using equipment.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he felt that the malfunction of the equipment was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee said that there were only isolated reports of pilots talking about a malfunction of aircraft systems through the equipment, and most of them were very old.
However, the FAA recommended to allow pilots to arrange for the decommissioning of the equipment by passengers in the event of instrument landing in poor conditions of sight.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and called them reasonable adaptation for travellers who would today be extensively equipped with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not in contradiction with safety," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Released by air rescue service of North Sea Island Island rescued bird
A bird flying to the coast by air rescue service, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea island, was released into the wild again.
The water raid was flown last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen, where it was plucked up by the Scottish animal protection organisation SPCA at their rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the center, said: "This water raid was probably a winter migratory bird from northern Europe, held up by the strong winds over the North Sea."
Apparently, the exhausted bird sought refuge on the bore island.
He added: "He could no longer fly, so we were contacted with the request for help."
On her release, the water raid was fit and healthy again.
Is Europe’s elite ready to do business with Great Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those in Britain who are looking for prosperity and work want to change our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British economic leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed over 1,000 executives from the economy, representing UK business sizes, sectors and regions.
Many will be surprised by the results of the survey.
We have found out that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that are modernising and growing, while the states in the EU are stagnating.
They want new trade links to be favored by the government side with countries such as China, India and Brazil, instead of holding to the long and strenuous process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
In their view, the majority of economic leaders believe that control over these key competences should be withdrawn to Westminster, from antitrust law to product legislation.
There was general dissatisfaction with the internal market, as according to the companies, the cost of the Brussels rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe's trade zone – even 40 percent of the large companies voted in favour of what is traditionally the most European-friendly.
Finally, and this is said most probably, our survey of economic leaders showed that a clear majority of Britain wants a price towards changing the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade is not based on politics.
This knowledge, which is found in companies of all sizes and leading companies, shows that the economy is pressing for a "senseful change" which brings the paper of action back to the UK.
It is a lot – a change in the agreement and better conditions for the UK would lead to a 16 percent change of opinion in favour of staying in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan for the renegotiation of British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power relations back to the UK from a renegotiation.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the Eurozone is now moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows, which means that companies are more focused on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.
Alexei Miller von Gazprom refers to Pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gas era
The start of the construction of the South-Stream pipeline in Bulgaria was one of the largest European energy projects, explained the Gazprom Executive Board.
"Today's event is a milestone: the construction of the Bulgarian section of the South-Stream-Gaspipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun," said Gazprom, Alexei Miller, Chairman of the Executive Board, in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for energy security throughout the European continent.
South Stream aims to increase the diversity of Russia's export routes across Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, where the majority of Russian gas is stored for Europe, creates an increased risk in conventional routes, as can be heard officially.
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "always" eliminated.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at preferential rates when the entire project goes into operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other subordinate countries is scheduled to begin at the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
For national and international investors, there is no way past the real estate site in Germany.
The economic framework data are correct and the funding possibilities are excellent.
This has been the tenor of the 9th real estate day of the stock market magazine.
The German real estate markets benefit from the strength of the economy and the favourable economic conditions in the country in Europe.
Christian Ulrich, CEO of Europe, Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, pointed to this on the 9th real estate day of the stock market magazine.
According to Ulbrich, as requested by German commercial real estate companies, they show a view of the volume of transactions.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the previous year's section.
In the UK the plus was only 6%, in France it was 19%.
"Immobilieninvestments offer attractive returns," said Ulrich.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees accused of sexual offences against Jonathan Lord
Two YMCA staff from New South Wales (NSW) were charged with sexual offences related to children before 2011 indictments against the Child Care Officer Jonathan Lord from Caringbah, as the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children learned.
However, in the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA had declared that it had never been "in the organization to deal with an incident involving sexual abuse of children".
Managing Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which an YMCA employee had been charged with child pornography offences, and another in which a sports teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall had been convicted in 1991 for his abuse of trusted children.
Hare told Gail Furness, one of the Commission's assistants, that he knew of the first case but did not know the second.
He acknowledged that the opening of the YMCA to the Commission had also been inaccurate in the assertion that 'it had given the YMCA's external audits, in which the YMCA was recognised as at the forefront of child safety'.
On the contrary, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA has been informed that it has received the second lowest assessment of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities in August of the year.
Hare, who started with 21 at the YMCA, admitted that the management had failed "from me to down" in Lord's position and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the child safety directives.
Lord had been sentenced to 12 boys at the beginning of the year for sexual misconduct during his two years of activity for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare argues, however, that the YMCA has a cultural problem that has prevented employees from reporting Lord's crimes regarding the safety of children.
The employees said they had observed violations, including that Lord was alone with children, she was privately cared for as a babysitter, had her sit on his lap, told one that he loved it, and had children play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose superior was Lord and who had asked for a training for child protection because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the head of child care, Jacqui Barnat, who was Lord's superior in YMCA Caringbah, was "very intimidating and most of the time very unimaginable".
The Managing Director stated that he would not accept employee statements according to which they would not have trusted to refund their superior report.
Instead, he said, their friendship with Lord had affected their judgment, which is why they had not reported it.
He explained that he had informed the management board of the YMCA NSW that the lesson that the organization had to draw from the "Jonathan-Lord-Swiss case" concerned "not reporting" by employees, and the board agreed with him.
Hare said that the decision to force employees to sign confidentiality obligations was made shortly after the allegations were made, by the management of the child services of YMCA, Liam Whitley.
He said that this should prevent contamination of the evidence, but what had been 'over-evil' and badly implemented.
When Jonathan Lord worked there between 2009 and 2011, YMCA NSW was not a safe organization for children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, expert on sexual abuse of children, explained to the Commission.
He explained that there had been "serious problems" in recruiting, reviewing, incorporating, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would take advantage of the chance to return as British Prime Minister – but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview this evening on the fifth anniversary of his retirement from the office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic policy issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics, and his comments are mostly limited to foreign policy and his role as a messenger of the Quartet of Peacemakers in the Middle East.
On the question of whether he would like to return to the office of Prime Minister, Blair was quoted from the Evening Standard from London as saying: "Yes, sure, but it is unlikely that this will happen, so ..."
When the horse show experts found themselves in crowds in Cardiff to drive the horse of the year, they were aware that a hard competition was imminent.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who is not even in kindergarten and only made his first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland Pony Toffee easily trod through the three rounds and got the first prize – leaving behind 30 adult opponents.
The inseparable couple, both equal in size, were praised for their appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition, which is held by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
At his appearance in competition with men and women with elegant melons, he had put his cap on in a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural skills in dealing with the pony that lay far above his age.
And Toffee received best notes for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and since every day practiced with the Shetland Pony.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee are a great strain."
They had to face the entire field and left the square with gold cup and rosette.
It was only the second time that he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all excited when he won.
Perfect strangers in the arena thought him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been performing horses for over ten years.
Howells said: "The whole audience was electrified and everyone fired him and slapped him."
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens that he cares about.
Just as he started, it won't take long until he's on the horse of the year – and I'm sure he'll cut it off well.
A speaker of the annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony."
Together they're a great team.
The judges then evaluated Fenton and Toffee how well they beat themselves and presented themselves in the lead ring.
They pay attention to good cooperation between Pony and Führer – and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's sweet clothes helped her part, which was really perfect for the occasion.
Chinese newspaper to be reformed after a call
A Chinese newspaper, which had requested the release of a reporter who had been accused of defamation, had to be reformed, stated a press regulator.
The New Express in Guangzhou had a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribery money to falsify reports about a state-owned company.
Now the new expression will be subject to 'overall rectification', said the regulator.
The 'rectification order' was issued by the Press and Publications Authority, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the New Express, which is part of the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published a number of inappropriate reports on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The editorship management of the New Express was disorderly," the regulator announced in a statement.
She said that they had decided to "hang down an administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporter's license."
The Yangcheng Evening News Group was also “required to make a complete rectification of the New Express and recommended that the relevant actors be identified at the New Express and that the New Express management team be immediately checked.”
Chen had written several articles for the New Express, in which he reported alleged financial irregularities in a manufacturer of construction machinery called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the title page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment.
"In this case, I have injured Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he explained to the government news station CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was looking for money and fame.
I realized I was wrong.
Following Chen's apology, the New Express published an apology on the cover page and stated that it had failed to check the reports correctly.
Various well-known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely forced, despite a change of law at the beginning of the year in which the authorities were forbidden to force someone to accuse himself.
Drug tunnel with its own railway between the USA and Mexico discovered
One of the most refined tunnels for drug smuggling between the United States and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric train operation, has now been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 120 cm tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they'd ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in a zigzag pattern over a length of six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
In the area there are countless invisible warehouses, making it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could be transported unacquainted, the authorities explained.
At the time of the discovery of the tunnel, eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine had been secured, according to the records of the court.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were accused of possession and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They are threatened by a prison sentence between ten years and life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers set up an extensive underground network of drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October, which challenges the drug cartel to bring its product to consumers quickly.
In 2010, the authorities found a nearly 640-metre long passage with rails, which ran from a kitchen in a residential building in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Actor Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of two-year-old Flynn.
Actress Orlando Bloom has expressed himself to separate his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric, who was supposed to be broadcast on Friday (local time), Bloom said, "Life sometimes doesn't go exactly as we plan or hope."
Kerr and he still loved himself, emphasized the 36-year-old.
"We will support and love each other as Flynn's parents".
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and in 2011 their son Flynn was born.
Veganism, according to Lexika, is subject to Vegetarianism, but it is very different from this in a very significant way.
Because while vegetarians allow themselves to eat cream cake, ice or a strong Edamer, these badger eggs are not on a vegan's menu.
Milk, cheese, egg, besides the waiver of meat and fish, the vegan leaves from all animal products - honey is also denied.
What remains is to be asked, but the vegan world of nutrition is characterized by considerable ingenuity.
"Bread spreads are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local reform house, which provides a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in Domgasse.
For 13 years the native New Zealander vegan lives, in Lampertheim he (almost) finds everything he needs to live. "I changed my diet and became a vegetarian."
Around the turn of the century the next step took place and I became a vegan.
"But the conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the shoe choice," says Proctor, the artificial leather prefers normal leather.
He realized that it is also in other everyday interests without animal products.
First of all, vegan is his ethics.
"I don't want animals to die for me," says Proctor, the maxim of the vegans, which extends to the entire consumer behaviour.
Instead of grieving after burgers, stir eggs or rubber bears, the veganer quickly discovered completely new products, which increased enthusiasm.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "actually, vegan does not represent his absence, no ash, but it's an enrichment." The assumption that with food conversion you reduce the choice of food options, Proctor brings back more to the power of habit.
And these conditions made some more well-intentioned attempts fail.
"The addiction factor is a very crucial factor that allows many to give up quickly, similar to smoking," Proctor makes a comparison.
And apply: "Some tastes are not to be attached to the animal".
Often it is the spices or the kind of preparation that make up the taste.
"But you can also create the same effect in other ways," explains the vegans.
Proctor brings you to a barbecue, for example, eggplants, mushrooms and some vegan spices.
He pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it is supposed to taste deliciously once and for all.
Of course you want to have something between the teeth, that's legitimate.
"It's supposed to taste, but it's not just to reduce animal food," says Proctor.
Health damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption, he has not suffered.
For me, the change had a positive aspect.
I do not absorb any foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who feed exclusively on vegan.
"My blood levels are good, I often have to check," advises Proctor.
In particular, many vegansimus critics warn about the lack of vitamin B12.
"Since animals are fed with feed, instead of grazing on the pasture, it is questionable whether the meat that is bought in the refrigerator is high in vitamin B12," says Proctor.
For vegans, it is also possible to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are fine," he explains.
Proctor did not have to go far enough for food procurement.
Finally, there are basic foods everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
Anything I need, I'll find it on the spot.
I just buy something special from time to time.
"Many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive, but this is the case with "usual" finished products as well."
However, the preparation of vegan courts was much cheaper and less time consuming than generally accepted.
"There is a lot to discover in the kitchen, with a few small knives you can do well, if not partially achieve better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of egg, with its vegan cheesecakes Proctor could also make his parents-in-law amazed.
The vegan gives a new spice to family celebrations.
This has dynamics when you cook together, it has a new value.
"The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves," says Proctor.
But of course skepticism has already been met.
Don't you like my food anymore?
"Shall I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - on such questions, you have to act as a vegan with a sense of fingertips.
"I don't deny people, I'm part of this society," Proctor doesn't want an enclave.
And more precisely, the everyday world does not seem as foreign as it is suspected - and the vegan does not seem as restricted in everyday life as generally accepted.
Fast Food is also allowed.
There's French fries everywhere!
"Many doner shops offer falafel, or a vegetarian yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he deviates from pasta dishes, or just ordered a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants are so slow about it.
"When I started to feed vegan 13 years ago, everything was even more difficult," the New Zealander can find out a development: "You have to talk to the people, draw their attention to it."
"If there are enough demands, they may be inclined to supplement the menu," he hopes.
Vegan restaurants develop, such as the Kombüse in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor wants other restaurants to have at least a vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they're the opposite of exclusive.
"Fish dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," Proctor notes.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, then veganism is a safe way to make the largest part of the world impossible," says Proctor.
However, the purchase of vegan products could be a bit difficult at the beginning.
In particular, if one learns to understand that animal additives can also contain in peanuts as color transducers, one seems to quickly leave the courage with the following ethics in so many hurdles and traps.
Not only because of this, Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: "Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and their Alternatives" explains the many ingredients, the food and cleaning products are added.
" Gradually you develop a scanner view and know what signs and logos you have to pay attention to "It is sometimes better to do small steps than to stop or stumble," white Proctor.
Veganism, he is an important moral fingernail that appeals to consciousness.
He may not quite manage to deduce his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to question his habits critically.
The exchange manager Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers breathing.
The trade at Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon German time.
In a communication, the operator was responsible for technical problems.
The other eleven US options markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business freely.
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger pawns at the stock market operator.
Only on Tuesday, the Nasdaq indices had not been calculated for one hour due to errors in data transport.
In August of this year, there had been two foreheads in a week alone.
First, the U.S. Investment Bank Goldman Sachs had sent a lot of bad sales orders to the option markets due to technical problems.
As a result, the stock market operators needed almost a whole day to review and delete the orders.
Two days later, half of the total stock trade in the United States came to an end for several hours due to a computer booth on the Nasdaq stock exchange.
The Facebook Stock Exchange was also provided for a look-up last year.
The Nasdaq systems had not grown the flood of purchase and sales orders, later the stock exchange supervisor determined SEC and made the company a record penalty of 10 million dollars.
Constance: Radlers kill 63-year-olds
The accident had been reported by the police when a 26-year-old man on Thursday evening, around 22 o'clock, was on the left foot of the train from the station to the marketplace with an irregular ride.
When suddenly a 63-year-old man walked from a local on the walk, the cyclist could no longer brake in time according to the police.
At the following collision, the pedestrian was pushed against the wall of the house, went to the ground in the further course and pulled a 15 centimeter long space wound on the head.
A rescue car team brought the injured to the clinic for medical treatment.
British police send Assange an extradition notice
The British police today handed over a extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said that they had given the 40-year-old Australian a 'call to stand up' to invite him to appear in a police station and added that he should not comply, he threatened to arrest him.
Assange threatens extradition to Sweden because of the charge in a sexual offence after his options have been exhausted under British law since the Supreme Court rejected his objection to extradition at the beginning of the month.
He was afraid that Stockholm would deliver it to the United States, and on 19 June he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard has “made an invitation to a police guard at a time chosen by us for a 40-year-old man,” said one speaker.
He continues to violate the terms of his release on bail.
The message did not comment on the delivery of the police's request.
Assange fears that he will be delivered from Sweden to the United States and charged there for possible espionage charges after he published over 250,000 diplomatic messages on the Enlightenment website WikiLeaks.
Driver, who was boarded with 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs, receives £1,000 penalty
A car driver was charged a penalty of £1,000 because he had driven up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35 from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the drinking cup between his legs.
In front of Colchester County Court, Howie confessed himself guilty, without having taken the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
In addition, how was it condemned for the payment of costs of £90 and a sacrifice of £100?
Tax for foreign property owners against London's bubble
The Ministry of Finance provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still waiting for the final decision of Chancellor George Osborne, who had imposed a 7% stamp tax in the 2012 budget on apartments costing over two million pounds, as well as annual fees for buyers, apartments as a company and not as individuals.
Already now, income from the stamp tax for residential property in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which in the fiscal year 2012/13 were at 708 million pounds, accumulated revenues for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the northeast, northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cook said: "After the increases in the stamp tax on high-priced apartments and the introduction of the related legislation against circumvention, one can hardly claim that high-quality properties are too low, regardless of the effects of the outdated municipal tax system."
"However, this step could make some foreign investors more reluctant in terms of buying real estate in London, or refraining from selling ownership," he added.
First class properties – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in the wealthy London southwest belt, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, have earned a record value of 11.8% last year.
Prices in Central London showed a steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an emerging 'domestic market' where the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, such as a survey by Savillis.
Scientists could shed more light on the context in which a dog’s tail swings with its mood.
Previous research has shown that happy dogs with the tail were more welding to the right (from the dog's point of view), while it was the left side in nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive these subtle differences and react to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, said: "In humans it is well known that the left and right brain half react differently to stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to see this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just as in humans, the right half of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the side of the tail of their comrades, the researchers monitored the animals, while these films looked at other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four legs and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we'll soon understand why the cock moves into the one, sometimes in the other direction
Professor Vallortigara said: "We showed the dogs films with dogs – either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we could thus control the movement of the tail more to the left or right."
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressive dog moved the tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the wading dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail inclination was mainly left (returning from the dog's perspective, which weaves), her heart rate rose and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs have learned from experience what movements they should be concerned about and when not.
He said, "If you have different encounters with other dogs and you are connected to the tail in a direction with friendly behavior and the right side produces a less friendly behavior, then you react on the basis of these experiences."
The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers understand their animal's emotions better.
John Bradshaw, expert on dog behaviour and guest student at the Faculty of Animal Medicine at the University of Bristol, explained that this was not the first study to examine whether left and right were important for dogs.
Last year, a team at the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when it's a satisfied dog.
Another research at the University of Victoria, Canada, said: “Dogs go to a robotic dog when their ‘swan’ weaves to the left and not to the right, instead of becoming restless – exactly different from the Italian study.”
According to his statement, the differences could therefore stir up that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
"Although there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for different purposes, many of the details still have to be determined – and dogs are no exception," says Bradshaw.
But since their behavior is simple to record, it probably won't take long until we understand why the tail sometimes moves into one, sometimes in the other direction.

The band from Sheffield should play in Hydro on Friday.
However, due to Alex Turner's lead singer's illness, the concert must now be relocated.

Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
Pope Francis was to be appointed new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope and they are also the ones who elect a Pope, so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached 80 years of age can no longer take part in the Pope's election – that is the case of a group of 120 "voting cardinals".
In an explanation in which the news was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said there would be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony was held to appoint the new cardinals, also known as the Consitorium.
"Papst Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene the Konsistorium in February so that other meetings which require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of elective cardinals would probably have fallen by February.
He explained that a pope usually appoints as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of elective cardinals would look back at 120, and as many cardinals as he would like.
The Consistorium next year was therefore important because it was the first since Francis' election in March this year, says Valero.
There is now a certain overlap between Europe and Italy in particular.
"It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they only have a tiny number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the Council of Cardinals, founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from around the world who have the task of finding opportunities to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided all by himself.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He said it was "well possible" that Francis asked the cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been able to – that is all new.
Valero said that the bishops would typically be called to cardinals from large places, but Francis was "full of surprises – we do not know who he is calling".
GM calls back new pickup trucks in the USA to repair the seat back
General Motors recall nearly 19,000 of its brand-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra Pickup trucks with construction year 2014 in order to fix a problem with the manually adjustable seat loan, so a release from the US vehicle safety regulator on Friday.
For some of the cars there may be a defect in the mechanism for restoring the front seat.
For this reason, they do not comply with the federal directives for vehicle safety with head restraints.
"If the vehicle is raised from the rear, it is possible that the head restraint does not properly protect the occupants, so that there is an increased risk of injury," read the message on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
The supply of GM trucks began in June and represents the most important model start of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency-related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners about the defect in the first half of October.
The NHTSA failed to check the notification letter because of the 16-day government shutdowns, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were newly developed for the 2014 model year, had increased by 20 per cent in the first ten months of the year, said GM on Friday.
In October GM sold 42.660 Silverado and 16.503 Sierra Pickup trucks.
The GM share increased by 1.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Desperation screams of an Obama whaler
I have chosen President Obama twice in the hope that change will be possible
He said that Obama had made commendable efforts that had been thwarted by Republicans' blockade tactics.
The blockade policy does not excuse Obamacare's website problems, the drone attacks
Obama's memoirs on the 2008 election campaign were a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a terriblely sad book.
It is a book that I believed it would cheer me up during the sad second year of my medical study and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and describes Barack Obama's memoirs as the 2008 presidential election.
When I'm done with my patient writings and go to bed in the evening, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and a speech could rob me of the breath.
The election became a victory in the earth and a newsman was held to show the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates cried with joy and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama moved to office in 2008, he had 82% approval values.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is an evil awakening, as if being torn out of a dream.
It is hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I first gave my voice, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama is shop.
I also believe that party political blockade tactics have cut too many aspirations with which our nation should be brought forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, to name just a few.
But after my countless times defending the Obama government against colleagues and acquaintances, I ended up with my attempts to explain.
I have reached a point of political despair.
Republican blockade policy cannot explain why we allow the hearing of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones in overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of Americans and why whistleblowers are punished that reveal state misbehaviour.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why public funding and spending limits are being circumvented during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report in which it says that the efforts of the White House to calm the media were the 'most aggressive... since the Nixon government'.
And recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in which more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood by 18 that government work could contradict the political campaign that preceded it.
Apparently, the MPA is not a predictable course, as a opposition party and accidental events such as the Newtown massacre shape the public debate.
But if I look at the above examples, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I chose Obama again in 2012, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
With Romney presented a confusing and unexplained alternative, he did not seem to be able to determine his direction and positions.
I had the impression, a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fill the hope that we had heard for so long.
But with the decline of Obama's approval values to below 45% this week, the return to 2008 by this book has become so much harder.
It arouses in me the desire for the many promises that have vanished into the air.
This week I read a section in the book describing how Obama had to put a heavy loss on Clinton in the pre-elections in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the electorate after the decision, he told his employees that they had to come back on course and follow the purpose of their business.
"I want us to find our magic," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree more with you.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in parental leave
The billionaire and MP Clive Palmer said that Prime Minister Tony Abbott was in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters became pregnant and could therefore benefit from it.
The mining magnate, which is in a courtial dispute over the payment of 6 million dollars at CO2 tax, raised the claim when he wanted to wipe out questions about whether he was in conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for deciding whether the CO2 and mining taxes are being deleted or cut.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that the daughters of Abbott would benefit personally from the laws.
"It's in a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters gets pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she gets a vacation," said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Palmer Electoral Commission officially announced with 53 votes the lead after the re-counting as the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax.
Palmer called for a revision of the voice count process so that this one could move faster.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the voting?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we not have a system in which to move in, enter data into a computer, immediately choose and then at 6:30 p.m. we have the result?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the ballots.
Do you use them because you can erase the results if you don't like them?
Nowadays, it is incredible to agree with pencils.
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said that his policy was to be an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new office “very seriously”.
A public office deals with the public service.
"We do not seek any reward except for history, namely that we can serve in a critical period of this community," he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange dealers
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two dealers from its foreign exchange department, so two people who are familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the worldwide government investigation into suspected manipulations on the currency market is rapidly taking off.
Some of the largest banks in the world, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they are cooperating with the authorities in investigations in the world's largest financial market, on which the U.S. $5.3 billion change the owner every day.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the extensive investigation that led to the scandal of the libor interbanking business.
The Bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received information requests from authorities.
"Our investigations on this issue continue and we are fully cooperating with FCA and other regulators," said the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, the situation related to the fact that RBS had forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent from and to an earlier dealer to the British Supervisory Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This dealer, Richard Usher, had left RBS in 2010, and is now to have been given leave to JPMorgan by his current position as European leader of the Forex spot trade.
Rohan Ramchandani, Head of European Spot Trading at Citi, was released this week and Matt Gardiner, formerly leading currency dealer at Barclays and UBS, was suspended at Standard Chartered this week.
None of these dealers were charged with any misbehavior.
Bankers belonging to Barclays and the Citigroup were members of the Instant Message Group of Usher, who said the situation was close.
UBS announced this week that she had taken steps against some of her employees after the Swiss regulator Finma had declared that she was investigating a suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with allegations that banks should have agreed to deal with transactions on the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks streamline instant messages and emails from several years looking for cases of misconduct.
The news of these investigations has put traders in an uproar that has been one of the most profitable of the trading units of investment banks in recent years, but this year was under pressure because low volatility in currencies limits the chances for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to slow down the deal and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the extended and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
A leading dealer noted that despite the enormous volume of daily foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of own internal platforms by banks leads to "you can influence the market with very low ticket prices".
The news came out the same day when Credit Suisse announced that she had announced this week to a dealer of her London Exchange Traded Funds offices after he had caused a loss of nearly six million dollars at the end of last year.
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperates with them.
"We are sure that the dealer has acted alone and that the matter is restricted," said Credit Suisse.
Painted the building fence on the Bechtle property
A group of the citizens' initiative "Swiss meadow" has embellished the building fence on the Bechtle property at the Kurpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, she cleaned up and spread the footpath, says a press release.
The planned cover of the crumbling house in the back part of the property was not allowed for security reasons, as the site threatens to slip off.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had agreed to the beautification action with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Before the action of the BI, a transparency with the message "We are for it" had been applied.
However, this did not interfere with the actions of some 20 members of the citizens' initiative.
Her motto on the big poster was "We're Against Bauruinen".
In doing so, she wanted to point out the danger of even bigger ruins on the Swiss meadow - the giant project should one day fail.
In conversation with many passers-by in front of the "building site", it became clear that some people believe that many people will be better off with the implementation of the city's project, although few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they start resigning because the city is further delaying these answers, says it from the BI.
As it was to be heard, the mayor's public statements are also effective.
In May, at the municipal council meeting, he had said that he was afraid of the thermal bath, the population should vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex in the Swiss meadow.
Some seem just too scared because of this, others feel they are "plump blackmail attempts" at the population, says the BI press release.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Ranknick shield for Shiris: Mane not a swallow king
As satisfied as Ralf Ranknick is with the current high shape of the Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg, the sports director of the "Bulls" was disappointed by the referees.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the Schwalbenkönige category," he took the two offensive vortices into protection on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg.
The last occasion for Rangnick's criticism was yellow for Mane at 3:0 against Grödig last Sunday, when Senegalese became a supposed actress - which of course was none as the TV images showed.
"A grave wrong decision," said Rangnick, who called Arbitrator Harkam "all overburdened".
Harkam would also have contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-Trainer Adi Hütter after the game.
He defended his German compatriot: "I would have behaved the same in every single situation as Roger Schmidt".
Schmidt himself does not want to have any contact with his colleague after the coat of arms with his wife.
I don't know why.
"For I am the one who was insulted," said the 46-year-old.
However, in view of the success, Ranknick voted for a praise hymn.
"There are only two words for this: really good," he said.
There's not much to put off.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
It's supposed to go on like this.
There won't be any changes in the winter transfer time.
There are no great reasons to change anything.
"Besides a player comes with the wish that he wants to leave the club," Rangnick made it clear.
Supreme Court confirms Obama's Health Act
It is a great victory for the Obama government: The U.S. Supreme Court decided today that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – requires US citizens to take out health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional within the tax authority of the state.
The Supreme Judge John Roberts struck the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided against it.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 pages of the law and also considered that the health law, according to which states would either need to extend the access requirements for drug use or otherwise remove all state medical funding, would not be unconstitutional.
The lawsuit against the law had been challenged by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law had been rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including the final challenger Mitt Romney, in the pre-election campaign 2012.
Norway: Norwegian town makes itself light with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian town brought light into their gloomy valley.
Due to the low sunset, the Rjukan in the Vestfjord valley usually sinks from autumn to spring in the shade of the surrounding mountains.
With three gigantic reflectors at 45 meters in height, a century dream came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!", mayor Steinar's mountain country swarmed at the launch ceremony in TV2.
Some valley dwellers were able to cope with the sun’s chairs, others with sunglasses for safety.
So far, sunny people had to go to a nearby summit with a cable car in winter.
Ten years ago, local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to direct the rays with mirrors into the valley.
This basic idea, however, has been in place since 1913.
After several years of debate, the City Council had finally adopted the 5 million crowns (about 615 000 euros) of expensive project.
A similar construction has been created for some years by the Italian alpine village of Viganella winter sunshine.
Post is barely empty yet on Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed the red points for Sunday emptying are still at different mailboxes of the core city and districts, but if you read the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG, you will quickly find out that the emptiness of Sundays and holidays is no longer taking place," says the FDP.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and holidays, only before the postal building on Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld were emptied.
Whether there is still Sunday empty in Hofheim and Rosengarten, the answer to the request of the FDP is not answered.
The FDP spokesperson of social and youth policy, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to follow up here.
Sunday learning is an important postal service right at the time of the appointment.
"In spite of the rise in the price for letters on January 2013, this venture is radically and unthinkable."
Thomas Bittner, Chairman of the Liberal Group and the City Council of Europe, supports his colleagues in the group: "What annoys me is the fact that here the emptying times are changed or also deleted.
From the point of view of the public, the post is miles away.
"At least the mailboxes in the districts of Neuschloss and Rosengarten have to be emptied again on Sundays," said Bittner and Fluhrenbeck unisono.
Also valid for the core city, especially not mobile fellow citizens should also be able to reach a letter box with Sunday learning.
Tuberbeck asked the city parliament if the city administration was planning discussions with the post office on this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
His knowledge, however, also gives a Sunday lesson in Hofheim.
Her party has spoken out for privatisations.
"Then decisions are made elsewhere," Maier said.
Frankfurt Park Fees are expected to rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could soon be more delicately expensive.
This morning, the city's magistrate advises on the presentation of a transport delegate Stefan Majer (Green).
The parking fee should therefore be increased by 50 percent.
However, prices should not be raised, but the time interval of parking watches and parking ticket machines should be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes.
Then, in December, the city council has to decide.
The IHK Frankfurt Retail Committee considers this "not a good idea".
The parking possibility immediately before the store was "a not underestimated advantage for smaller retailers".
The German Transport Club believes that an increase after two decades is "very appropriate and actually long overdue".
Public transport is also becoming more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Quick actions overrun host
With a narrow frame, the gentlemen I of the TSV Freudenstadt in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen had to approach the TG Gönningen from the Schwäbische Alb.
The Älbler stood with an experienced team on the other website.
Soon, however, it turned out that they could not keep up with the fast actions of the cities of joy, even on an age-related basis.
With the hard and placed upbeats the Gunnings were extremely difficult.
Repeatedly, they missed the passports and attacks to which Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz played cleanly over the network centre and were not in place with the block defense.
Two high first sentences clearly expressed the superiority of the cities of joy in all interests.
In view of this depressing and game-determining performance, the third set was then won slightly lax and lustless at the 3:0 end (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On November 2nd, the TV Baiersbronn, which was able to clear up in Nagold, will be a much more powerful opponent in the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt stood in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard-hit two-hour match.
Nervosity on both sides caused faults and points in particular when accepting the ball; even in the passes, the precision was sometimes flawed and in some critical game scenes the overeifer prevented the view of possible score points.
In this highly balanced encounter, however, the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto voted consistently for the great physical effort and a pleasing commitment of both teams.
Nursing day at the small English cottage
For the fifth day of nursing in the wake of the Natura 2000 project above Hotzenwald, a group of dedicated participants met at the small Engländerhütte in Ibach.
Due to popular suggestions, this day in the area of the hut the view to the valley should be cut free," said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
Many hikers, according to Kaiser, described this area as the gleaming piece of the gorge, on which the landscape offers the ideal setting for magnificent views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the care day was an appropriate instrument to strengthen the connection between man and nature.
He offers every citizen the opportunity to put accents in nature itself.
At the same time with the tourist aspect, the ecological aspect could also be taken into account.
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait from the Department of Nature Conservation of the Government Bureau of Freiburg, following the welcome by Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronage and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist destination of the wide view covers itself with the aim of maintaining the now heavily grown old common meadow with its specific protected habitat types by opening up and connecting to the still existing pastures.
Certain species such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
You need these free connections to species conservation.
Tribukait said that they do not want to fail at this point to break a lance for the planned biosphere area.
In this planning, the current measure is not only applied seamlessly.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and environmental development on the basis of the internationally recognised UNESCO status and thus a continuous addition of the life-project as well as previous care days achieved for the future.
According to these different designs, headmaster Christoph Wehle and Life-Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been beaten in advance, the forest tower was available for recall if necessary.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of juniper bushes and the care of a dry stone bar.
The goal was the free view at the vantage point.
Löffingen: Köffler is still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the town of Löffingen can be described as an attractive city with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a pioneering school policy, children, youth and seniors, as well as its own urban works, no second mayor candidate has yet reported.
As the only candidate to succeed the mayor Norbert Brugger, who is no longer a candidate for old age, is the 46-year-old banker and business manager Dieter Köffler from Löffingen.
The application deadline will expire on Monday, November 11, at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of previous Nortel patents, filed an avalanche of lawsuits for patent infringement against phone manufacturers on Thursday, including Google, the company that was handed over by Nortel during the insolvency auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringements in Texas.
Rockstar is located in the joint ownership of Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases.
The patents involve technology that brings search terms on the Internet into line with relevant advertising, so the complaint, which thus meets the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not directly accessible.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC create mobile phones that work with Google's operating system Android, which stands in sharp competition with Apple's and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google issued an initial bid of over 900 million dollars for Nortel patents.
Google increased its offer several times and finally offered $4.4 billion.
After being handed over to the Nortel patents by Rockstar, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola's library on patents.
"Although Google failed with its attempt to acquire the patent at the auction, Google has violated the patents and continues to do so," says the complaint.
Rockstar demands a high level of damages from Google, as it claims that Google's patent infringement is intentional, according to the allegation.
Egypt defends the first freely elected president
Mohammed Mursi resigns from office, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of political disputes in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a "new Egypt" when he was the first freely elected president of the country to be sworn to the successor of Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arab world and the fifth head of state of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He placed the oath in front of the 18 black robes dressed judges of the court, who are seated on the Nile and imitated an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are looking for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," said Mursi at the ceremony that was broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, a real democracy and stability," said 60-year-old Mursi, an engineer trained in the USA and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group who had since its founding 84 years ago been taken seriously as a banned organization by the respective government.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Mursi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after eleven o'clock local time.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered before the court to cheer up the new president, and in contrast to the presidual prank from the Mubarak time, traffic was stopped only briefly so that the Autokonvoi could cross the commonly lively road that connects the city centre with the southern suburbs.
As an uncharistic 'replacement wheel' of the brotherhood his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he presented himself not only as a candidate for Islamists but all those who wanted to achieve the efforts of the 2011 uprising against authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," explained Mursi, dressed in a blue suit with red tie, to judges in the wooden chamber in which he left the office.
Later, Mursi went to the University of Cairo, where he was supposed to make his speech.
He was officially welcomed by an army chapel that played the national anthem that he belonged to in respect of.
The military leader Feldmarschall Hussein Tantawi was present.
Upon arrival, he was welcomed by hundreds of people present in the university's largest auditorium with speeches from "The army and the people are one hand".
The University of Cairo, founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, has developed into a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Mursi took a symbolic oath on Friday on the Tahir Square, the birthplace of the insurrection, which led to the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubarak last year, and he promised to call back the presidual powers that the military council had taken over from the head of state hunted from the office.
But with the release of the official oath before the court and not as usual before the parliament, he bows to the will of the military, which indicates that the power struggle will continue.
Mursis speech on the Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek provides two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberger discotheque "Blue Velvet" has begun.
On Friday evening it is called "Pump this party", on the morning Saturday evening it continues with an Ü 25 party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are of course promised by the organizers on both days.
Workers fell from ladders: severely injured
When a defective outside sensor was replaced, on Thursday a 51-year-old worker crashed from a ladder in Eggelsberg and was severely injured.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to change a defective heater at the outside facade of a guest house.
As he stepped on the ladder leaning toward the roof, it slipped away and the man fell on the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was brought to the state hospital Salzburg with the rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6".
Violent in South Africa: Twice Lifelong Detention
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to twice life-long on Friday.
This was reported by the SABC station.
The victim died later from the consequences of the serious injuries.
John Kana had already been found guilty at the beginning of the week of the crime.
The act had triggered horror across the country.
The 21-year-old was raped by Anene Booysen in February in an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
For 14 hours the doctors fought for the survival of the victim, but in vain.
The sight of the young was so horrific that the nurses and sisters needed psychological assistance.
Kana had admitted to being in a bar at night with Boys during the process.
He also confessed to having beaten them and raped them, but he struggled to be responsible for the girl’s death.
The police had first left several perpetrators, but two suspects were released from custody because the evidence was not enough against them.
The prosecutors also stressed during the trial that she was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape is almost everyday in South Africa: there are about 64 000 ads each year because of sexual violence.
That is almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people there is significantly more population than in South Africa (50 million).
Police and women's associations in South Africa value the darkest figures in the case of sexual violence but 10 to 25 times.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo in search of the "best ham in the world": For the TV broadcast "Galileo" the Pro7-Star Bonndorf visited.
The speaker explains right at the beginning: The most important thing for the ham is the pork cones, Turbomast is not a good condition.
Can hams that you get in every supermarket be a quality product?
Uli as head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, Jumbo explains the working style of the company "Adler" in Bonndorf.
"Germany's favorite ham" as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
Only with hair protection and kittel does he get inside the factory.
Jumbo also needs to disinfect his hands before he can reach the micro.
Jumbo to strengthen fast food in Waldshut sighted
"Here I am working reddish quantities," the TV-maker, black forest ham as a mass product wonder.
16,000 bullets per week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat percentage, color: Uli explains the quality of the product.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months.
Level television?
Details such as the Ph value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the flesh, the higher the ph-value.
"There I am excited when you see Roberto Blanco what happens then," said Jumbo cynically.
Here the level of private television is presented in pure culture.
But it's still worth watching.
The viewer sees that crushing the wedges continues to be manual work.
Because: Black forest ham is traditionally found without bones in the shelf.
The secret to ham is the mixture of spice with salt.
The smoke tower and smoke fire remind Jumbo visually of a "U-boat".
The trick: Tooth branches provide the special taste of ham in the smoke.
20 days in the smoke finally make the ham almost black.
"Now the disc disappears in Jumbo," he announces the test feed.
"It's really delicious," said the TV star's conclusion.
This will allow all participants to live.
You thought travel agencies were part of the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to resist the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the entire year and expects record revenues from vacationers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now assumes an adjusted profit before tax between 325 and 340 million dollars, compared with 305 to 315 million dollars in its previous forecast.
If the current target values are reached, this means a growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to record profit of 290.4 million dollars in the period 2011/12.
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre won eight percent in the first half of the year and booked a strong start to the second half of the year, especially in the Australian and British private business.
"Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable and some of them are on a good path towards record year revenues before interest and tax," he said.
This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which typically belong to our strongest producers.
In Australia, the leisure industry has recovered in the second half of the year, reflecting a slightly weaker market for business travel.
Similarly, the leisure business of Flight Centre in the UK, while business customers also spent less time here.
The US business recovered from the weaker first half of the year due to seasonal conditions, so that a profit is expected for the third consecutive year for the whole year.
Flight Centre's shares rose by 3 cents yesterday to 38.20 dollars.
Schools are being held to greater focus on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In courses on English literature, students will have to deal with at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels starting in 1914.
The test also includes 'unseen texts' to stimulate wider reading.
The combined course from English literature and language is abolished.
From 2015 onwards, students will have to pass an independent GCSE test for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish the new curricula for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects that have been radically transformed.
Other nuclear compartments will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the Audit Supervisory Authority, will announce a reorganization of the GCSE structures, including a new distress system and less course work.
In a summer speech, Minister of Education Michael Gove said that there is a 'wide consensus that we need to reform our audit system in order to restore public confidence', stressing that the GCSEs would be 'more challenging, ambitious and stricter'.
Studies show that less time is spent on mathematics in English schools – 116 hours a year or three hours a week per year – than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the timetable, coalition circles are said to encourage schools to set up more hours, combined with a stronger weighting of the discipline in rankings.
In the curriculum, more attention is paid to 'problems from the right life', including financial mathematics.
Beautiful animals and tasty cakes attract
The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and color strokes will present the circuit association performance show at the Bürgerhaus this weekend.
The reviews were made already on Thursday
Again, the Ortsverein W514 organises this large exhibition.
Breeders of associations in Soest County show their best animals here as well as young Wickeder Hobbykeepers their rabbits.
On Thursday, six price judges took the evaluation of the numerous rabbits and were able to distinguish outstanding animals.
Visitors to the show are best informed as the assessment of all animals is attached to the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition takes place by Mayor Hermann Arndt Saturday at 2.30 p.m.
The rabbit show is open to all visitors on Saturday from 10 a.m. and on Sunday from 10 a.m. to 15.30 p.m., to which the ceremony will be joined.
The guests are also invited to a tombola equipped with state-of-the-art prices and to a deliciously stocked cafeteria.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Discussion Forum
At the next Ecumenical Forum on Monday, 21 October, at the New Museum of the Castle, it is about the theme "To Hell with Hell - theological considerations of today's dealings with the last things".
She is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Discussion Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical churches of Salem, Salem Castle and Bodenseekreis Cultural Office.
Johanna Rahner wants to look into the question in the forum, how today people are evaluating the "last things" after death.
If people had known too much about it in the past centuries and had put on those pictures of heaven and hell "that shape our ideas to this day", the contemporary prophetic doctrine of hopes of completion is more like a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness.
"The greater hope has been pushed out of the faith of Christians," says the speaker.
She has "provided us with so many question marks that the exclamation marks seem to have come out of our hands".
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the crucial challenge remains the annoyance of death".
This connected the question of that longing, "who dreams that in the end everything may be good".
Johanna Rahner, born in Baden-Baden in 1962, studied Catholic theology and biology from 1982 to 1989 at the University of Freiburg.
She received her doctorate at Dr. theol., also in Freiburg in 1997.
The habilitation of fundamental theology and ecumenical theology followed in 2003 at Wilhelms-Universität, Germany.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has held a Chair of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from Little Heuberg affirm their creed during the firming process
In two divine services, 101 15- and 16-year-old youths of the pastoral care unit have been promoted at Kleinen Heuberg.
In the morning, the group of Laudato-Si accompanied the divine service, in the afternoon of the youth choir The Spirit.
With the reception of the Firm Sacrament, the young people said yes to their baptism and gained the power of the Holy Spirit.
Over the past few months, under the direction of Diakon Reiner Dehner and with the help of numerous parishioners, the Firmlings had prepared for the big festival day.
In various projects, they met various tasks of Christian community life and shared the youth day in Untermachtal.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race inspires participants
In beautiful weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to cope with the round course across the hills around the lake.
This is what Ulrich Knobel is telling us about from the organising sports club Illmensee.
Among the participants, especially on the short-range over 15 kilometres and 300 metres above sea level, were also numerous everyone's cyclists who once wanted to practice their hobby in competitive atmosphere.
Two junior riders of the German top class were also at the start of this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aachen-Linz came with the recommendation of good placements at the German Championships.
These two were able to disembark themselves from the field as expected.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small leap of time to the finish and defended his title as the overall winner of the short-range.
==References====External links==
With the ladies it was Theresa Duelli from the team nightmare that made it right on top of the winning troupe.
Anne Adel from Illmenseee and Leonie driver from Owingen came in second and third place.
A gratifying development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the municipality.
Not only in terms of performance, the whole range of athletes was represented.
The age structure also reached the oldest starters from the age of ten to the youngest up to 70 years.
In the main race this year there were even more absolute topaths at the start.
Four riders were able to disembark themselves from the regional top riders.
This includes Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike semi-professional from the Black Tusk Racing team.
Pangerl and a teammate had already been world champions twice in the twelve-hour careers.
This year he became European champions in this special discipline.
With this also Roland Ballerstedt, who already calls two German master titles in the duathlon his own.
After 45 kilometres and 900 metres of altitude, there was a winch final in the finish line ahead of the three-seat hall.
Pangerl was the first to race across the finish line.
Only a second after that, the Routine Ballerstedt was able to secure the second place in the overall ranking.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann came to the finish as a third of the overall score.
Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest timer in the main race.
The second place was secured by Areane Blersch from Binzwangen in front of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Sporters and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well organized course of the event.
On the way through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelling and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the West African country there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 "CNN Heroes of 2013".
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the Top 10 to choose him as the "CNN Hero of the Year".
The winner receives 250,000 dollars to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years George's Bwelle watched as his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
In 1981, Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
First, he had only one broken arm, but then an inflammation that spread to his brain and caused a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to receive the treatment they had to offer.
"It's not easy," Bwelle commented.
You can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwell's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
On the other hand, the ratio in the United States is for a doctor of 413 people.
But even if there were a doctor for them, most Cameroonians could not afford to visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three quarters of health expenditure in the country is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his compatriots saw suffering in Bwelle made the decision to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team performed 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels on weekends in rural areas and offers free medical care there.
Since 2008 he and his volunteer group have helped almost 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people force themselves into small buses and ride with the laced medical equipment on the roof over unpaved terrain into the villages that need help.
Not always, everything goes smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will be welcomed like heroes: a feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is a real reason for celebration and festivities – with its broad smile and boundless energy – are welcome at the joyous celebration.
The next morning, the team will start investigating hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per trip," says Bwelle.
They come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village – and that on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is necessary for the school, but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anaesthesia.
Operations usually take place in a school, town hall or an apartment; after surgery the patients get up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next one.
The lighting for the surgery and the disinfection equipment is fed by the group's generator and thus Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early morning hours on Sunday.
It is a strenuous sentence, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
"They rumble all night, so that we can stay awake and continue our work," Bwelle says.
On Sunday the team returns to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – has performed 700 free operations last year and knows that with its work it creates a huge difference for the people to whom it helps.
One man explained that the free operation of a break in performance he had received now enabled him to work again.
"This changes the future of my family," the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon at the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his non-profit activity, says Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
"I really don't know when he's sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who, in the second year, is studying at Drexel University in Philadelphia Medicine and volunteering in Bwelles Group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who come from the USA and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home.
"We can be involved in operations that help us drain blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle," explains O'Malley.
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
The students usually pay for their journey to Cameroon themselves and bring frequently donated sanitation material.
But if they are first in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, the transport and the instructions.
"He's no doubt a hero," says O'Malley.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no limits.
For Bwelle, the almost constant work is no burden.
Helping others to enjoy a happier life and thus fulfill a promise he has made to his Father brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this work," Bwelle says.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and to ease the pain.

Excellent the fight mastered
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel "The Old Man and the Sea", was cut to death by Horst Janson.
Janson is himself an old hare in his metier, acting art.
The old man, Santiago, can't do anything about fishing.
So the two simply complement themselves great.
It is almost thought to be able to see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man, from whom the fishing boy Manolo speaks.
When Santiago sits on the chair tired of life, it's real at Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson masters excellently.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man who did not give up and ultimately won the battle against the fish by his knowledge and his will.
Janson is on stage alone on a wide range of tracks.
He manages to focus the audience's attention on himself, so that his monologues are not a moment boring.
His efforts at finally pulling the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea is made up of only blue water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann leaves the old man in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance he sets the active scene into the light: the cottage of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who sings with her songs and her magnificent voice the life feeling of Cuba.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm along with it and are guests of the bar at the same time.
Tourism: Departure to the Romans
At about 120 metres in length, a sewage canal from the Roman era is preserved below Cologne.
If you visit Cologne, do not pass the cathedral.
Around 157 meters the two towers rise in the sky and make it the second-highest church building in Europe.
However, few visitors who admire the two filigree church towers can imagine that there is also a lot to discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne's underworld.
The service center of Cologne-Tourism is directly on the Dom.
The tour begins quite unspectacularly: "We start in the underground garage," says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city’s fathers wanted a city that was self-righteous, and so from the rest of the old city walls, only what was not too big was left.
Therefore, most of the users of the car park are rushing past the Roman remains today and are just taking off their car.
But anyone who looks more closely at the park deck D2 discovers an archaeological site separated by metal lattice rods.
There are about five meters high ruins of hand plated stones.
"It is the remains of the Roman city walls built in the second half of the first century after Christ," says Schulze.
Before returning to the daylight, Schulze lets the participants at the upper park level take another look into a dark, 15 meter deep shaft.
This is the well of the old dome, which unfortunately is hardly seen.
The next station of the tour is the Pratorium, and here the participants get back down to the depth.
We are experiencing here the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the CCAA President.
What CCAA means would like to know is a visitor.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which in good German means as much as "the city of Roman right and city of Agrippinenser, founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar for the imperial cult"".
And the Praetorium is the former palace of the governor, the centre of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the exhibition, a tunnel entrance leads to the Roman wastewater canal, which is preserved here at about 120 metres in length.
"You can walk along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want," Schulze cheers the guests up.
There's still a little bit of a surprise in Schulze.
After collecting the key at the checkout, he leads the group to a 16 meter deep, walkable shaft.
"We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater, which was indispensable for the ritual washings.
To this day, in the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins go down to the eighth century, different water levels can be read through changing levels of the Rhine.
The Micwe becomes part of an archaeological zone on the town hall square for which the construction work should start shortly.
Until completion, however, a few years will be gone.
Leg almost chopped off: new edition of rocker process
A bloody attack in the Rocker milieu will be rerolled after more than four years.
A trial for attempted killing, dangerous body injury and damage to property against two 30-year-olds has begun before the Landgericht Frankfurt (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict safety precautions.
The defendants are silent.
They were supposed to have been active in the rockers scene and then belonged to the bandidos.
In June 2009, the Public Prosecutor's Office accused them of stabbing and hitting three men in a car together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt.
All the victims were severely injured, a man almost lost his leg.
The victims should have been part of Hell's Angels' competing group.
One should have been a senior member from Berlin.
It seems that a persecution hunt with several cars had preceded.
According to the charge, it was about territory struggles and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants had been acquitted in a first proceedings at the beginning of 2012.
A judge said at the time that it could not have been proved that the men were actually involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized.
The Bundesgerichtshof raised the judgment after the audit of the prosecutor's office and referred it back to the Landgericht for a further hearing.
One of the defendants is currently in open court for another offence.
It was mainly about the reconstruction of the processes at Tattennacht.
As a witness, the investigating commissioner was loaded at that time.
In the center were phone calls by the defendants and other persons who had been interrogated by the police.
It is difficult that Rocker almost always adheres to a law for her - and does not pronounce.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had been unpacked.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Frankfurt Public Prosecutor's Office (Oder) said on demand that new traces had emerged since the last proceedings.
Eleven more days of negotiation are set for the process.
The throwaway company doesn't think
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood was good, but at some point it goes home.
Only: In the bows of the people on the passenger seat and back seat, the hunger becomes evident.
Of course, one cocktail or another sparkling wine may be responsible for that!
What's closer than chilling to go to the next drive-in to enjoy a little bit?
I admit, I'm happy to join you when it's late-night or early morning to the fast-food shelters.
A couple of fries, a cola, a burger, and then nothing like going home to bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco walkers become apparent.
Because what do you need to miss, that you throw your fast food bags out of the car window with constant regularity?!
On the weekends in particular, discarded paper bags lie on road borders and on parking spaces.
"Why?" I wonder.
Are the people too deaf to take the bags home and to the next garbage bucket?
It's not just that paperware shatters the landscape.
Tüten has already covered transport facilities such as control boards and thus caused accidents.
But it is unlikely that "weighing society" does not reflect on what is thought to be, probably she does not even know what that word means.
When you're on the road more often in the evening, just with several people in the car, you know how a backlog can look after crowded nights: clothes, bottles and other garbage are storming.
There would be more or less nothing to do with a couple of things - as opposed to the street where no one wants to rumble on the rest of the food.
I already see the day coming when the cities and communities will have to get out of the way - and demand the fast food chains for their bags of pfand.
Obama's withdrawal from health policy
According to fierce criticism, President Obama made a withdrawal yesterday with his frequently repeated clear promise: 'If you like your health insurance, then you can keep it.'
After hundreds of thousands received a letter of resignation from their insurer, the Republicans threw the president in the last few days before he deceived the American public.
Yesterday Obama re-related his original promise.
"The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep them," he said at a talk in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the cancellations, Obama called on those Americans who received such communications to take care of themselves in the free market for a new insurance policy.
Most citizens could thus receive better, more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or cheaper than predicted.
"You come up with a better offer," he said.
The government said it was a little surprising that the five percent of the population who had completed insurance themselves would have to cover themselves at a different rate, since their contract did not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
"I would like to say directly to these Americans that you deserve better," said Sebelius at a hearing before the Committee on Energy and Trade of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch of the online platform has been “miserable” since October.
"I'm just as frustrated and angry as everyone else," she said.
I am determined to regain your trust.
This statement by a late Sebelius to an adviser sitting behind her at yesterday's hearing in the House of Representatives was recorded after a dispute with the Republican MEP Billy Long from Missouri, which was about whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeated the question as to why the "architectin" of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily refrain from a state-funded insurance scheme to charge a fee to HealthCare.gov himself, which they now want to sell to millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian Air Force Base
On Thursday, an American government official who wanted to remain anonymous claimed to the American news station CNN that some day earlier, Israeli fighters had attacked an air force base in the Syrian Latakia.
According to CNN, the goal had been "reacted and associated equipment" of which the Israeli government feared that they had been destined for the Lebanese Hezbollah.
Syrian and Lebanese media as well as the Arab channel Al-Arabiya had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been shot on Thursday during the night of Wednesday, and the Israelis were responsible for it.
The Israeli TV channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia, on which Russian S-125 Newa defense missiles and SA-3 rockets can be seen, which according to Channel 2, have a range of 35 kilometers and can transport warheads up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertain The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the Reuters News Agency quotes an also anonymous Israeli government official as saying that he believes that Israel has carried out the attack, but is not sure.
A spokesman for the Israeli Ministry of Defense said, at least, "We do not comment on these reports".
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had already tried, in part successfully, to deliver ground-air missiles to the Hezbollah.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons meant the crossing of a "red line" that would follow a military response.
John Kerry, in an unparalleled confession, explains that the U.S. espionage had "adequately gone too far"
John Kerry, with an unexpected admission, indicated that the US's anticipatory attitude towards its surveillance programmes had been softened by saying that in certain cases the espionage had "adequately gone too far".
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he, together with Barack Obama, was responsible for having been turned on autopilot when the explosive revelations of Whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA's spying activities became public.
Through the leaked information, the U.S. government has entered a diplomatic storm of disarmament from its allies.
In a video speech at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: "Without a question, the President and I, as well as others in the government, have learned of some things that have practically expired by autopilot, simply because the ability to do so was still due to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and of course to 11 September."
He was the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to agree that the U.S. esp. had crossed a line, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said: 'In some cases this has gone too far.'
The President is determined to establish clarity and therefore conducts a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse takes place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons in this process are not impaired.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force of good and that many lives had been saved by its monitoring operations.
He added: "We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up."
There is a radical extremism in the world that is opposed to killing people, bombing people into the air and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to intercept and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented aircraft crashes, attacks on buildings and the killing of people because we have experienced such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, US legislators will travel to Europe to dispel the concerns about the alleged American espionage and to convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the US in the anti-terrorist efforts, as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs stated on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that he spoke to representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations due to the frustration of the National Security Agency's monitoring.
"It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that Europeans remain on board with regard to our joint efforts to combat terrorism," said Murphy, who is the first to sit in the Senate as a democrat and as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
I also go to Europe to make it clear that we need to continue working together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their annoyance with the NSA programmes.
Media reports, according to which NSA has recorded millions of telephone data in Europe, have strained relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the secret service said this week that the reports were inadequate and based on a misunderstanding of metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other disclosures quoted from documents passed by Snowden, according to which the NSA monitored the cell phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of national intelligence, James Clapper, defended the espionage of allies as necessary and stated that this is common on both sides.
In all the Tumult, Murphy said that his authority was preparing the trip of the Congress to be held this year and hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members will be published in the coming days.
He said the exact route is still being worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the journey was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some "serious words".
He said that European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programmes they have been using for years.
"Although we can change our monitoring programmes and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, they also need to deal with the fact that we are not the only ones who spy," says Murphy.
In the meantime, John Kerry is on a weekend trip to the Middle East and Poland to deal with the Groll about the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as the US surveillance activities.
The use of Nicolai Müller in FSV Mainz 05's Bundesliga's outward play at Augsburg FC threatens to prevent a persistent injury to the jump joint.
Mainz bnagt for a use by Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he'll try to train with the team.
So far, he could only do so individually.
"We will decide on his use in the short term," said coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best goalkeepers with six hits.
Because the Mainzers must already refrain from the injured service providers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australian filed an appeal against a prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver has filed an appeal against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 after she had reported to the Thai police that a local taxi driver had raped her in the morning hours on Sunday, June 10, while two other men held her.
Later, however, the footage of a video camera showed that she had arrived safely in her hotel after she had been separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she was able to figure out the story.
Until the trial, she was on site in police custody.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security prison on the outskirts of Phukets, instead of in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy League, who turned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra with the request for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about his daughter's welfare and wanted her back to Australia.
"We are of course deeply concerned, but we hope that she will be home as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford has filed an appeal against the judgment and is against a security deposit of 50,000 Baht on a free footing.
In Australian reports it was to be read that in the meantime she is vacationing in the resort of Krabi in southern Thailand.
On the contrary, the court heard that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and was warned that the appeal could also lead to the imposition of a higher sentence of up to two years in a prison for adults.
However, it is also possible that, after the recent murder of the travel saleswoman Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand might be trying to improve its attacked tourist image, and it is therefore coming to a free speech.
