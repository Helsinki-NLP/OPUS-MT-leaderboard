Welsh members of the National Assembly are afraid not to be taken seriously
Several members of the National Assembly were recently dismayed by a proposal to change the name of the Assembly member or of the Assembly member of the Welsh Parliament or of the Welsh Parliament.
The reaction came because of plans to change the name of the National Assembly of the Welsh Parliament.
Members of several political parties are concerned that they may be ridiculed.
A Labour member said that his group is concerned by your "MWP rims on Twp and Pwp"
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means foolish and pwp beesj.
One member of the Plaid party said that the group is not good and has proposed alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative member said that his group has an ‘open mind’ when it comes to name change, but added that MWP is not far from the word ‘mumped’.
In this context, the Welsh letter w was not different from the English Yorkshire dialect's pronunciation of the letter u.
The National Assembly delegation, which now drafts legislation to introduce the name change, said: ‘The final decision as to which members of the National Assembly should be called will, of course, be up to the members themselves.’
A Welsh official decision of 2017 gave the National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the delegation published the results of a public hearing on the naming proposals which showed great support for calling the Assembly the Welsh Parliament.
In the case of the title of National Assembly members, the delegation favoured Welsh MP or WMP, while the MWP elections received the most support during the public hearing.
National assembly members have apparently come up with other suggestions, but the struggle to become some has given the leader of the delegation, Elin Jones, the main work, to submit the bill for a few weeks.
The legislation of the reforms includes other changes in the way the delegation works, including rules on disqualification of members of the assembly and the design of a committee system.
Members of the assembly will be able to vote on their names when they debate the bill.
Macedonians smoke in public shelters to change the country’s name
The voters shall vote on Sunday to change the name of their country to ‘North Macedonia Republic’.
The People's Liberation was determined to resolve a conflict that has taken place for many decades with the neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighbouring country in the north represents a claim on the territory and has had many objections to Macedonia’s membership applications to the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president, Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the dissociation of names, said he's going to look away from the results.
The supporters of popular disapproval, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in name is simply the price of becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
The clock of St. Martin stops while the churches of Harlem, New York, strive
"The old ones I talked to said that in the old days there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Adams.
‘There are currently none of the parts.’
He said he understands why the barns disappear.
"People socialise in other ways nowadays," he said.
‘Barbars are no longer crowded in the neighborhood that people visit normally.’
When it comes to churches, he is concerned that the money from selling the property will not last as long as the leaders believe, 'and sooner or later, they are back where they started.'
He added that churches can be replaced by apartments filled with the kind of people who don't care about helping the historical places in the neighborhood.
"Most people who buy apartments in these buildings are white," he said. "and this is how the day comes when all the churches are suspended, because it is unlikely that these people who move into the apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white socks before Harlem became a black city - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin Church a decade later.
The original white Methodist Congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black sock that had preached nearby, moved into the building.
Saint Martin was taken over by a black sock lease by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who also led the boycott of shopkeepers in 125th Street, a chief managing officer in Harlem where the owners were opposed to the addition or promotion of blacks.
The building was damaged in a fire in 1939, but when pastor Johnson's followers planned to build him up again, they also ordered a new clock game.
Pastor David Johnson, son of Johnson Senior and successor of St. Martin, was proud and called the bells “the bells of the poor.”
The expert who played on the clock game in July calls it something else: ‘Ein Kulturskat’ and ‘Ein historische instrument ein unreplaceable’.
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also commented that it was the first clock game in the world to be played on by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who left the church to play at the larger riverside church clock game 18 years ago.
Merriweather said that St. Martin did not find a replacement for him.
What has happened in Sankt Martin in the past few months has become a complicated story about architects and builders, some of them added by the leaders of the church toy people, and others of the episcopal bison.
The sacristy, which is the leader of the sok and consists of the leaders of the toy people, wrote to the bishop in July with concern that the episcopal symbol “would ask the sacristy to pay,” even though the sacristy was not involved in the addition of architects and builders.
Some of the members of the sock have complained about the lack of openness from the bison.
13-year-old shark injury during hummardy in California
Authorities report that a 13-year-old was attacked by a shark on Saturday while he dived for lobsters in California on the opening day of the hummar season.
Arrested her just before 7 a.m. near the Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel commented on the KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dived with friends in about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard that good calls for help. He paddled off to good with a group and pulled him out of the water.
Hammel said that first he thought only good was excited to have caught a lobster, before he realized that good shouts «whatever bit me!
Something bites me!"
"His whole collarbone was torn off," said Hammel, observing when he reached good.
‘I screamed that everyone had to get out of the water: there is a shark in the water!’ he added.
The boy was picked up by the air ambulance and taken to the Rady Hospital for children in San Diego, and his condition is critical.
It's uncertain what kind of shark it was that bought good.
Captain Larry Giles said in a press conference that a shark was observed in the area a few weeks earlier, but that shark was not a dangerous black shark.
Giles added that good got serious damage to the upper body.
The authorities linked access to the water from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate and secure the area.
Giles commented that there are more than 135 different species of shark in the area, but most are not likely to be dangerous.
Retailer Sainsbury's bets on beauty product
The British store chain Sainsbury's shall compete with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenham's beauty product and offer storm gas interns in the shop.
As part of an investment in the UK's beauty market, worth £2.8 billion and continuing to grow as fashion and interior sales decline, Sainsbury's test out their beauty products in 11 stores next year, and more shops if there's a success.
The investment in beauty product comes at a time when the shelves that used to be filled with TVs, microwaves and interiors now stand empty.
Sainbury's said they should double the number of beauty products to 3000 products and offer brand Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
They shall mark L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees more space and have separate areas for each brand such as in the Boots stores.
The store also needs to relaunch its own boutique make-up shop and make most of the products vegan, which is intended to attract more young customers.
In addition, the perfume negotiator Fragrance Shop will test the hall of its perfumers in two of Sainsbury's shops. The first open in Croydon, London, last week, and the second open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online handling and a shift towards buying small quantities of food every day from local retail shops means that large retail chains need to find new ways to reach customers.
Mike Coupe, managing manager in Sainsbury's, has commented that shops will look more and more like storm magazine, while shops are trying to fight the low-cost Aldi and Lidl shops with more services and non-food goods.
Sainsbury's has partnered with the interior chain of Argos in hundreds of shops and introduced several Habitat stores, since they bought up both chains two years ago. Sainsbury's claim that this has increased the food store and so defended the purchase.
The shop's previous attempt to renew beauty and pharmacy departments was not a success.
Sainsbury's collaboration with Boots early in the 21st century, but this was the end of when the parties didn't know how to share the profits from the pharmacies in the shops.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's selling chemist Celesio, who had 281 pharmacies and owned the pharmacies of Lloyds, for £125 million three years ago.
They added that Lloyds still has a role to play and will offer an expanded luxury range of skin products, including branded La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, commented: "We have changed how the beauty shelves will look and feel to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also appointed specialists to provide beauty services.
Our trademarks are designed to suit all needs, while the attractive environment and practical locations mean that we are now an attractive beauty destination challenging the old way of acting.»
Peter Jones "rapid" after Holly Willokhby withdraws from the agreement worth £11 million
The stars from the TV program Dragons Den, Peter Jones, are ‘rapid’ after the TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from an agreement with his lifestyle mark worth £11 million to focus on their new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to promote the interior and addition of their Truly.
The couple's cooperation has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop mark.
The host from the program This Morning, 37, just got to know Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left the star from Dragons Den, Peter Jones, in the middle of the development of their new cooperation on a lifestyle brand to focus on their own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was "rapid" when the Golden Holly confessed during a busy meeting on Tuesday at Jones's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that Holly's new contracts - worth up to £1,5 million - mean that she no longer has time to cooperate on the interior and adjacent Truly.
The cooperation has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop mark and was supposed to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to make sense that she was not going to work with Truly, while Jones escaped the United Kingdom to settle down in one of her holiday homes.
A source said, "Truly was absolutely at the top of Holly's priorities.
It was to be her long - term plan for the future, and it was to last many decades.
Her decision to withdraw has surprised everyone involved.
No one threatened their own ears on Tuesday, Truly was so close to launching.
There is a warehouse in Marlow filled with goods ready for sale.»
Experts believe that the decision of this morning host, which is one of the richest stars in the United Kingdom, can cost the company millions due to heavy investments in the product, from cushions to candles to clothes and interiors, and can cause delays in launching.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, who is the mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, has our dear friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly together with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined him as Chairman of the Board in March.
Para vacations together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby shall become the M&S brand ambassador and shall replace Ant McPartlin who will host the ITV's I'm A Celebrity programme.
A source near Jones said yesterday evening 'We're not commenting on his business.'
Close calls 'and then we fall in love'
He puzzled about the criticism he came to get from the media to make a comment some might experience as ‘unpresidant’ and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Said Trump with his customs office as a «newspeaker».
"I haven't given up anything."
He commented that Kim is interested in a new meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump called a major step towards disarmament of the nuclear program in North Korea.
But the negotiations on the nuclear programme have stopped.
More than three months after the June Singapore meeting, the top diplomat from North Korea, Ri Yong Ho, said to the world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not received a ‘correspondent response’ from the United States of North Korea due to its early disarmament.
Instead, he added, continued the United States with sanctions to press North Korea.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"It's great between us and North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He added that his work to improve relations with Kim has brought positive results -- the end of rocket testing, help to free hostages, and the return of the remains to American soldiers.
He defended his unusual procedure in relation to relations with Kim.
'It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get in, we had about 200 people standing right there,' said Trump and pointing at the group standing ahead of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroy the island and kill hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign relief organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the inhabitants of Lombok had to flee, no one declared a national crisis, needed to obtain international emergency aid.
'Unfortunately, they have in many cases been very clear that they don't want international help, so it's a little challenging,' said Sumbung.
While the Redd Barna is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is still not safe if adding a foreign passport is allowed to work in the field.
Sutopo, the spokesperson of the National Crisis Agency in Indonesia, said that the authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international organisations are allowed to provide emergency aid.
Although Indonesia is often exposed to earthquakes, the country is not particularly pre-emptive of natural forces.
In the Aceh area, they have built shelters for tsunamis, but they're not common in the rest of the country.
In spite of warnings against tsunamis in Palu, there was no alarm, which most likely led to several victims.
Traveling between the Indonesian islands is usually quite challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was at berth in Lombok to treat those who were injured in the earthquake is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the place of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on the implications of Indonesia's infrastructure during the presidential elections and has spent a lot of money on new roads and railways.
But lack of funding has made it difficult for the administration to become President Joko, and next year there are choices again.
President Joko is also being pressured when it comes to sectarian tensions in Indonesia, while members of the Muslim majority have accepted his conservative threat.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee when Christians and Muslim gangs fought in the streets and used machetes, arrows and arches, and other primitive weapons.

Parliamentary statue of Cromwell becomes the last victim of the “rewrite of history”
The removal of the statue would be the karma of Cromwell and the Taliban-like destruction of several cultural and religious objects in England that his Puritan followers did during the civil war of the 1600s.
But the Cromwell Association portrays Crick’s proposal for the removal of the statue as ‘noise’ and ‘try to re-write history’.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Association, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would become a goal.
The iconoclasm during the English Civil War was cork ordered or executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps wrong Cromwell would have been the victim of the actions of his forefather, Thomas, for centuries before.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent representation of Cromwell is evidence of public opinion in the 1800s, and is part of the historiography of a figure that many have still found to be worthy of celebration.»
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was in the 1800s, and is still today, seen as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, and in his case it was, of course, against the monarchy.
Whether this representation is correct or not is still a topic for discussion in historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 1600s has shaped the evolution of our nation, and Cromwell was an individual who we know represented one side of that separation.
What he achieved as Lord Protector is also worth celebrating and remembering.”
Murder-grass attack and kill Chinese pawn
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in south-west China, following local media reports.
The man, named Yuan, was found dead, with cut artery and covered with blood, near a pig beige on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou Province, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to give pigs vaccines on a garden on May 30th, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had recently traveled with his cousin from neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning he found his cousin's dead, and discovered that the gate of one of the piglings was open.
He said in the bin there was a big man's pig with blood around his mouth.
The autopsy showed that a 250-kilogram pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"Just to my cousin was bloody and ruined," said the cousin, named Wu, to Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance camera shows that Yuan came to the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed him did not listen to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent him from attacking others, while the police collected evidence of the trip.
Yuan's family is now negotiating compensation with the market leader.
Even if it is rare, such measures from pigs have happened before.
In 2016, a pig went to attack a woman and her husband in Massachusetts, and caused serious harm to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kilo of heavy pig held a Welsh farmer captive between himself and a tractor, until his wife scared the pig away.
After a farmer in Oregon became one of his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba to CBC News reported that pigs are not aggressive to normal, but that the taste of blood can taste the animals.
"They only want to play.
They like to bite a bit, they're curious... they won't hurt you.
You just have to have enough respect for them," he said.
Residues of Hurricane Rosa brings rain to the south-west of the United States
As predicted in the weather forecast, the hurricane Rosa becomes weaker over the cool waters along the north coast of Mexico.
Nevertheless, Rosa will carry the sausages of north Mexico and south-west America the next days.
Rosa had wind strength up to 136 km/h and was a Category 1 hurricane until 5:00 in the Eastern time zone of the United States on Sunday, and the hurricane center was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is moving north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, there is a low pressure over the Pacific Ocean moving eastward towards the west coast of the United States. Rosa comes closer to Baja California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, and will move tropical humidity northwards to south-west America.
Rosa will bring up to 25 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical humidity will react with low pressure and cause thick rain in the south-west of the next few days.
Locally, between 3 and 10 centimeters of rain can create dangerous whistles and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity will result in rains of between 5 and 7 centimeters per hour in some parts of the south-west US, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain are expected in parts of the south-west US; especially over large parts of Arizona.
Hazardous fleas may occur due to scattered terrain and tropical rain.
It warns against trips in the desert on foot because of the danger of tropical rain.
The rain can make cliffs into fluttering rivers and lightning and towers will bring strong wind and dust.
The coming low pressure will also bring rain to parts of the coast of southern California.
Total rainfall of more than 1 centimeters is possible, which can create small flutes and smooth paths.
This will be the first rainy village of the season in the region.
Scattered tropical rain towns will start in Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before rain rises late on Monday and Tuesday.
Four Corners region can expect a lot of rain on Tuesday and Wednesday.
October can witness intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States while the Arctic is getting colder, but tropical strokes will still be quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic differences in temperatures, even between small areas.
Sunday was an example of dramatic temperature differences in central parts of the United States.
There's almost 20 degrees difference in temperature between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
The next few days will be summer heat trying to build up and spread again.
Much of the central and eastern US is expected to experience a warm start in October, with 25 degrees and upwards from the southern part of the Great Plains to parts of the North-East US.
New York City can reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
The long-term warning indicates that there are high chances of above average temperatures in the East U.S. through the first half of October.
More than 20 million people are looking at Brett Kavanaugh raising
On Thursday, more than 20 million people witnessed Brett Kavanaugh in the U.S. Supreme Court and woman who owed him sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six different TV channels.
At the same time, the political discussion of the case continued, with interruptions in the regular television programs of various broadcasters to reveal the latest news on Friday: an agreement reached by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake that during the next week the FBI will investigate the debts.
Ford told the Supreme Court Committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaughh felt her when he was full and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said, under a sensitive detachment, that he's 100 percent sure it's not her.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people saw the execution on Friday, according to Nielsen.
The company came up with this number by finding the average number looking at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
The number was not clear from any other channels displayed, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has trouble counting viewers looking at from the office.
To put this in perspective, there's a similar number of viewers looking at an American football final or Oscar distribution.
Fox News has supported Kavanaugh, and the channel was also the one with most viewers during the day with 5.69 million viewers, said Nielsen.
ABC was second place 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
People are still interested after the hearing.
Flake was in focus during the drama on Friday.
After Flake, a moderate republican, declared that he was on Kavanaugh's side, he was filmed by CNN and CBS while Protestants called after him on his way to a hearing with a domain office on Friday.
He stood and watched in the ground for several minutes while the Protestants rode on him on CNN live.
'I'm standing right in front of you,' said one woman.
«Do you think he is telling the truth to our country?»
Some said to him, 'You have power, while so many women are powerless.'
Flake said that his office has spoken, and before he went into the elevator he said he would have more to say under the committee hearing.
The Broadcasting Bureau showed the hearing on television when the Judge Committee was to vote for or against the nomination of Kavanaugh to be a full Senate and further incense.
But Flake said he could only do it if the FBI investigated the claims against Kavanaugh in the next week, which the Democrats have also asked for.
Flake was partly overconfident after talking to his friend, the democrat and Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators afterwards, Flake took a decision.
Flake's decision proved to have power, because it became clear that the Republicans could not speak for Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the complaints against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May owes critics to ‘play politics’ when it applies to Brexit
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, owes the critics of her plans to leave the EU to ‘play politics’ with future to the United Kingdom without regard to national interests, in an interview with newspaper The Sunday Times.
Theresa May is in Birmingham, England, to participate in the Conservative Party Conference on September 29, 2018.
Next to the May interview on the front of the Sunday Times is an interview with former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, where he takes action on the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and says that the proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU should collect each other's fees is ‘totally absurd’.

Dyteon Simpson, 20, is arrested and imprisoned for intentional killing, says Baton Rouge, Louisiana police.

After the execution of Simpson, the police said he admitted to have shot Wayde.
The deposit for Simpson was set to $350,000, reporting local visas The Advocate.
The Coroner in East Baton Rouge published an early autopsy report on Friday that showed that the cause of death was a shot in the head that went into the neck.
Baton Rouge police thank the police in Louisiana for their special forces, state police for their crime lab, the Southern University police force and local residents for helping them find Simpson.
The athletic director of the LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the local police for ‘watching the achievement of justice’.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 meter high basketball player woke up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points with 2.6 setbacks per game last season.

'This is something we're always afraid of,' said Wade.
The volcano spews out ash over Mexico City
The ashes of the volcano Popocatepetl have reached southern parts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Crisis Prevention Centre asks Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Sunday after the activity increased in the crater and centre registered 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The center had observed several rogues and quakes.
Social media images show thin layers of ash on cars in different neighborhoods in Mexico City, including Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity in the volcano, which is 72 kilometres south-east of the capital, since an earthquake with the strength of 7.1 happened to central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is known as "Don Goyo" and has been active since 1994.
Police collide with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of self-reliance
Six Protestants were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after demonstrators of self-contained noise accompanied by police forces, and thousands of other demonstrators protested against self-proliferation one year after the consolation of any release from Spain.
A group of masked separatists were held back by police forces while throwing eggs and powder varnishes that created dark clouds of dust in streets that are usually filled with tourists.
The group also broke out later in the day, and the police used batons to prevent escalation.
In hours cried the "Do Not Forget, Do Not Forgive" separators while the Protestants against self-responsive shouts, «Long live Spain».
Local news channels reported that fourteen people were treated for minor damage after protests.
The vote is still under pressure in the region and many will still have an independent one year after the October 1st vote, which was called illegal by Madrid, but was celebrated by separatists in Catalonia.
Most of the voters voiced for themselves, but there was also a low level of convalescence among those who were against self-stretching and boycott sedation.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent the eviction and electoral clashes occurred in the region.
Groups who were too self-serving sleeping in tents on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the state police.
The demonstration went off the stack anyway, but it was forced to take another path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protests together with his wife, said he no longer has hope of self-standing in Catalonia.
"Last year, we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying out of joy to be able to speak for themselves, but now we are stuck again," he said.
Although they won the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties who are too self-serving to hold power this year, while many of their leaders are in exile or in prison waiting for trial for the role they play in the organisation of the people's disaster and the subsequent self-reliance statement.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed protests in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict was hushed up by politicians on both sides.
"The tension increases more and more," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been part of the ongoing legal proceedings since last year, declared that he should make the elections in the European Parliament next year.
"To remain silent as a candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn the return of democratic values and repression we have experienced from the Spanish state," he said.

Menga-scot gives Livingston 1-0-says over Rangers in Scottish football
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston Sichers says
Stylish Livingston surprises Rangers and Steven Gerrard experiences his other saying after 18 games that train for the Ibrox Club in Glasgow.
Dolly Menga's shot turned out to be the difference while Gary Holt's side jammed with the Hibernian in others.
Gerrard's side has no victors in the Scottish Premiership league this season, and shall play against Hearts, as they are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before it's going to be Rangers' hosts for Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston has six wins in a row, and the main coach Holt hasn't lost yet since he replaced Kenny Miles last month.
Livingston loses his chances of being outlawed
Holt's team should have rented long before they scora, and created several problems for Rangers with the direct gaming say.
Scott Robinson broke through, but had low effort towards goal, which made Alan Lithgow have to work hard after meeting with Craig Halkett his heading over goal.
The home team was happy to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could create trouble for the remote.
And that's how the deciding goal became scora.
Rangers joined a free park and Livingston created an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson went to Menga, which took a touch and scora from the middle of the penal field.
Before then, Rangers dominated the ball, but saw that the home defense was solid and the keeper Liam Kelly was focused.
This pattern continues into the second half, even if Alfredo Morelos forces Kelly to save a target.
Scott Pittman tried to score, but was stopped by Rangers' keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow farted after the ball was returned from Livingston.
Passes were sent back and forth in the Livingston Penalty, while two sentences - after Halkett's challenge to Glenn Middleton, and one by hand - were waved away.
'Female' from Livingston Analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont in Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal battle and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
Each player played amazingly and still impresses on the curve upwards.
Their playing and player style has hardly changed since they returned to the top class, but much of the thanks for it goes to Holt for the way he has created the shock since he was coached.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was intense, and organized a defense at military level, while Menga distracted Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the battle.
Rangers were in contrast not motivated.
Even as good as they've been under Gerrard, they weren't good enough this time.
They didn't play well enough, and just cut up the home half once, which should make Rangers realize that they don't get up anymore.
Erdogan is allowed to make a mixture of welcome in Cologne
The government leaders in Turkey and Germany smiled under the blue sky when they met to have breakfast on Saturday, September 29, in Berlin.
It's the last day of Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany -- which is hoped to repair the relations between the two NATO countries.
In terms of human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey, our countries have their role in the European Union.
Erdogan went to Cologne to open a big new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police are preventing a population of over 25 000 from gathering in front of the mosque because of ‘causes of security,’ but many of Erdogan’s supporters met to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan - many of the Kurdish - also met to condemn Erdogan's policy and the German state's decision to welcome him into the country.
The duelling Protestants reflected the distinction between German Turks, who consider Erdogan to be a hero, and others who consider him an autocrat.

The Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flaum (for the benefit of drying area)
Tropical low pressure is rare in Arizona, but there's just one such weather phenomenon that's heading towards Arizona early next week, in the remains of the hurricane Rosa pulls south-west over the desert and creates fear of flaum.
The national weather service has gone out with flaum warnings on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and south and east Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and may give rain late Monday.
The national weather service in Phoenix two-way that only «ten tropical cyclonars have had tropical storm or low pressure status within 300 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that reached 60 kilometres within the Arizona border.»
The latest models from the national hurricane centre report between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain, with isolated amounts up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim area in Arizona.
It can count between 2 and 5 centimeters in other areas of the south-west desert, including central parts of Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, with isolated totals up to 10 centimeters.
For non-flooding areas, calculation from Rosa may be a wetting of the dry area.
Although flaum is a serious concern, this estimated benefit area of the south-west US that is exposed to drought is likely to occur.
According to U.S. drought monitors, there is an extreme drought of more than 40 percent of Arizona, which is the second highest drying category, reports weather.com.
First, the Hurricane Rosa moves across the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
With wind over 135 kilometers per hour, Rosa is on Sunday morning 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm encounters colder water in the Pacific Ocean and enjoys it down.
It is expected to reach the coast of Mexico with tropical storm power, Monday afternoon or evening.

‘A rain of between 7 and 15 centimeters is expected from Baja California to north-west Sonora, possibly up to 25 centimeters,’ reported weather.com.
Rosa will pull north along Mexico as a tropical storm before she reaches the border of Arizona early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will pull forward through Arizona and into the south-Utah Tuesday evening.
‘The greatest danger with Rosa or its remains is much rain in Baja California, north-west Sonora, and the US South-West Desert,’ said the National Hurricane Centre.
This figure is expected to create life-threatening fleas in desert and landslides in mountain areas.

Trump says Kavanaugh «suffers» under which the «smear and sine» democrats were against him
‘You are in a mood for the judges Kavanaugh is a voice against the relentless and unruly tactics of the Democrats,’ said Trump during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has suffered under where the ‘smear and sin’ democrats were through the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed before the Congress on Thursday, and in an emotional way denied the guilt of Christine Blasey Ford that he assaulted her sexually several decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified about her debts during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the "American people got to see how brilliant and brave" Kavanaugh was that day.
"You listen to the judges Kavanaugh is a voice to one of the most competent lawyers of our time, a lawyer with error-free services in the public," he said to a number of followers in West Virginia.
The president also referred to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of the Republicans in the mid-range elections in the United States.
‘Five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
I don't say, but I really do," he said.
‘It’s because I’m traveling around to fight for good candidates.’
Trump argued that the democrats were ‘standing against and blocking’.
The first important voice in the Senate about the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to happen late Friday, said a Republican representative of CNN.
Hundreds of deaths in earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia, numbering killers increases
At least 384 people are killed, many of them taken by huge waves on beaches, while a powerful earthquake and a tsunami frame the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, reported authorities on Sunday.
Hundreds of people were gathered to participate in a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when the waves, which were six meters high, struck the beach at sunset, and took many people while they destroyed everything they came across.
The tsunami came after an earthquake of 7.5.
‘When the tsunami warning came yesterday, there were still people on the beaches that didn’t go once and so they became victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesperson of the crisis relief agency in Indonesia BNP, in Jakarta.
"As if not the tsunami was enough in itself, he took cars, three tribes, houses; he rammed everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some climbed into three to avoid the tsunami and thus survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Photo from the air published by the Crisis Bureau shows many broken buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftermath continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes could be marked in the area around, which has a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia’s Technology Testing and Testing Bureau (BPPT) stated that the energy from the earthquake on Friday was about 200 times stronger than the energy from the nuclear bomb across Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The geography of the city, lying at the end of a long, narrow wave, may have increased the size of the tsunami, said the Agency.
Nugroho described the damage as ‘overall’ and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of the dead have been found under the remains of collapsed buildings, he said, and added that 540 people were injured and that 29 are still missing.
Nugroho said that the number of casualties and the size of the destructions can be larger along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer epicentered to the quake.
'We haven't heard anything from Donggala, communication is cut off' said Nugroho.
‘More than 300,000 people live there’, said the Red Cross, and added and volunteered them to the random areas.
'This is already a tragedy, but it can be much worse,' said the Red Cross.
The crisis bureau was criticized on Saturday not to inform you that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities said that waves came before the period of warning.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building crying desperately to man down the streets to warn them against the coming wave.
A few minutes later, a wall of water hit the coast, bringing buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't verify the video with the first one.
The thrust and tsunami are spring breakers and cut the communication around Palu, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the sewing aids.
The military has started the process of sending loading aircraft with emergency aid from Jakarta and other cities, reports the authorities, but refugees still need food and other basic needs.
Airports in the city were reopened to receive emergency aid, but will continue to be closed until October.
It was planned that President Joko Widodo would visit the evacuation centre in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in Indonesia exceeded 800.
It's very bad.
They added to the World Vision from Donggala have come safely to Palu City, and have looked up the tent in the backyard of their office. On the way to the city they passed the totally ruined area, said Doseba.
"They told me they saw many broken houses," he said.
It's very bad.
While emergency relief agencies are starting work to help those who have suffered from tsunami, some complain that foreign emergency workers with expertise in crisis management have been refused entry to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, foreign aid organisations and their added workers cannot start work until Indonesia has declared that the area is a national crisis zone.
It has not yet happened.
‘There’s a provincial crisis,’ said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
‘When the state says ‘OK, this is a national crisis,’ we can open up to international emergency services, but they have not yet updated their status.’
It is evening again in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, and friends and family of those who are still missing hope still on a miracle, but know that such natural disasters do not last well.
On Saturday, a little boy was scared from the sewer.
On Sunday, a woman was frightened from the remains of a collapsed building, where she had played the prisoner beside the dead mother said for two days.
Gendon Subando, the trainer for the Indonesian paragliding team, pulled two of them missing paragliding from the Asian games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
A man called Mandagi said that some of the prisoners in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
"As one with much experience in paragliding, I have an emotional burden to bear," he said.
Gendon said he was desperate to send whatsApp messages to the paragliders from Palu, who had taken part in the local beach festival, after he heard that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed.
But his messages showed only one gray hook, instead of two blue hooks.
'I think that means the messages didn't come out,' he said.
Twenty-six $26 750 from the mini bank in Newport, Levee, USA
On Friday, twenty-six hundred and seventy-five stole from a worker in Brink's company as he was filling up a mini-bank in Newport, Levee, USA, following a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The worker had just emptied a mini-bank in the entertainment area and was about to deliver more money, said Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While the worker was busy, a man jumped up behind the worker and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses observed several suspects while escaping from the scene, according to the press release, but the police could not determine the number of people involved in the raid.
If anyone has information about who was involved, they should call the Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes name - to Ye.
He declared the name change on Twitter on Saturday, and wrote, "The creation previously known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has had Ye as a nickname for a while, and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which he released in June.
The change of name came just before he was supposed to perform on Saturday Night Live, where he was expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces Ariana Grande on the show after she cancelled because of ‘emotional reasons’, said the program host.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current artist name, West has previously stated that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I believe the word "ye" is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," said West earlier this year when he discussed the album title with the Big Boy radio host.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
The name has changed from Kanye, which means the only one, to Ye, to reflect the good we do, the bad we do, our confusion, everything.
The album reflects over who we are.»
Kanye is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Didy or Didy, but this year he declared that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has collaborated with West before, has also changed the writing style of the name with and without hyphens and capital letters.
Future president of Mexico promises not to send the military against civilians
The future president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised never to send military forces against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he ‘never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.’
On October 2, 1968, the military shot peaceful demonstrators and killed about 300 people, at a time when left-wing student stirrers spread in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly support to students and opening several free universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of access to education have led young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double investment in artificial intelligence
Since China is working more actively with artificial intelligence, the US should double its investments in research on the subject, says the investor and user of artificial intelligence, Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments came after various parts of the U.S. government spoke of artificial intelligence, although the United States lacks a formal strategy for the use of artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, China introduced its plan last year, and aims to be number 1 in artificial intelligence innovation before 2030.
'The doubling of the artificial intelligence budget would be a good start, since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence,' said Lee.
A doubling in funding may double the chances of the next major breakthrough in artificial intelligence in the United States, said Lee to CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, who published the book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ this month through the publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is Managing Director (CEO) of Sinomation Ventures, who has invested in one of the largest companies of artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with a system of artificial intelligence that struck the highest ranking player of the game Othello, and later worked as a leader in Microsoft Research and was chairman of Google in China.
Lee recognizes previous technology competitions organized by the U.S. state, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked how time the next competition should be, so that he would be with and identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States usually have to work hard to get support from the state, said Lee.
'It's not China that takes the academic leaders, it's the big companies,' said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have rented excellent university students to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to strengthen research on artificial intelligence.
‘I thought that before artificial intelligence, doctoral students should be given automatic rest periods,’ he said.
The Chinese Government published its plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Association of Natural Sciences finances students at academic institutions, not unlike the American National Science Association and other state organizations, its way of distributing money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a joint centre of artificial intelligence, which is intended to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House declared the formation of an artificial intelligence committee.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI (artificial intelligence) Next.
The National Science Association invests more than $100 million a year in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, no one has worked on the proposals for national security and artificial intelligence in several months.
Macedonians smoke in public defence to change the country's name
The Macedonian people voiced on Sunday in a referendum whether they should change their name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia in order to resolve a several decades-old conflict with Greece, which has tried to prevent Macedonia from becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its neighbouring country in the north represents a claim on their territory and has used veto to vote against membership of Macedonia in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new proposed name, but nationalist opponents argue that the name change can undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he should not speak out in disarming, and a boycott has raised doubts as to how far people are going to reach at least 50 percent of the population she needs in order to be valid.
The question of the People's Liberation Seat is, ‘Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership and agree to the agreement with Greece?’
Name change support players, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price of the name change is worth EU and NATO membership. Macedonia is one of the countries that achieved self-reliance after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I am here today to speak for the future of this country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not binding by law, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have said that they will follow the outcome of the consultation to make her decision.
In order for the name change to take place, Parliament needs two-thirds of the time.
The Government Election Committee reported that nothing unusual had happened before 13:00.
Only 16 percent had voiced, as opposed to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 of all registered voters voiced.
"I speak for my children, we belong to Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, an elected representative in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voiced in Strumika in the People's Liberation in Macedonia for whether to change their name and open to join NATO and the EU on 30 September 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a boycott of the People's Liberation in front of Parliament in Skopje, by setting up tents and chairs.
‘We are for NATO and the EU, but we are not to change the name of our country,’ said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us under the name of Macedonia, we can go to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev has stated that membership of NATO will attract investors to Macedonia, which has more than 20 per cent unemployed.
‘I believe that the majority will vote for the change, of 80 per cent of our citizens will become members of the EU and NATO,’ said Zaev after hearing.
He said that a yes result can be interpreted as a «confirmation of our future».
A poll of Macedonia’s Policy Research Institute last Monday showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the People’s Disappointment – something in the required number.
Another perception measurement of the Telma TV channel in Macedonia showed that 57 percent of voters plan to voice on Sunday.
Of these, the channel said 70 percent was going to vote yes.
To close the public release, at least 50 percent must be voiced, plus one voiced.
Failure to close can damage the policy of the left-wing government that took over in May.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero navigates through the Brighton defense and scorar
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling wrecked the Brighton defense that led to the 2-0 win for Manchester City on Saturday in Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy, as he scorad for 65 minutes.
The Argentinian peak received a midway pass at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran past three Brighton defense players and reached an open path.
Suddenly, Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around one defender, before running past several others on the edge of the Brighton penitentiary.
He got past a passport on the left and found Sterling.
The English point used its first kick in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used the right foot to hit the Brighton-keeper Mathew Ryan with a shot straight into the right end of the target.
‘Aguero wears still with the feet,’ said the City trainer Pep Guardiola to reporters.
"We were talking about how he could play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scoraded when he did."
But it was Sterling who gave them the sky blue the first advantage of the Premier League game.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero took the ball deep inside the Brighton Territory.
He kicked the ball beautifully along the left end of the path to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball while he led Sterling towards the goal.
The sky blue point kicks the ball into the goal right before he slipped out of the path.
City to play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group phase at 12:55 on Tuesday in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play spoiler against Rockies in American baseball
With Nationals eliminated from playoff content, there was not a lot of reason to force a new start.
Scherzer has high competitive instincts, and hopes to take the moon on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if it can lead to playoffs for Rockies, who lead with one game over Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockies won at least 5-2 against the National Friday night, but looks forward to locking down the first division title.
"Although we're not playing for anything, it's worth playing because of the atmosphere here in Denver, with the audience and the other layer that most likely plays at the highest level this far this year.
Who would not like to play with such relationships?’
It is still uncertain who is going to start in the Nationals on Sunday, but Scherzer might want to ‘pitche’.
Scherzer, who in that case starts for the 34th time, throws a 'bullpen session' on Thursday and shall 'pitche' normally on Sunday.
Scherzer, who comes from Washington, is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 stringouts in 220 2/3-innings this season.
Trump collects voters in Western Virginia
The president uncannyly referred to his first election for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while he spoke about the importance of the Republicans in the mid-range elections in the United States.
«Everything we've done so far is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I don't stand, but I run around everywhere to fight for the best candidates," he said.
Trump kept going, "You can see this terrible, terrible group of democrats, you see that it's happening right now.
And they're overestimated that they're definitely going to take back power, you see how bad they are, how bad they are.
They don't care who hurts, who they must run over to take power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we won't give it to them."
Democrat, he said, is on a mission to ‘oppose and block’.
‘And you can see it based on the last four days,’ he said, calling the Democrats ‘not bad and ugly and dishonest’.
He referred to the senator and democrat Diane Feinstein, who got his audience to bow.
"Do you remember her answer?
Was that you playing documents?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, I'm waiting--it was really bad body language--the worst body language I've seen."
Labour is no longer tolerant.
They are intolerant to those who say what they mean
When Momentum activists in my local party voiced to censor me, it was not surprising.
I'm the last one in a series of Labour MPs that's been told I'm not welcome, just to tell you what I'm thinking.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way because she protested against antisemitism.
In my case, I was criticized for being incompatible with Jeremy Corbyn.
When it came to the importance of running responsible economics, national security, Europe, and other similar themes that Jeremy ironically disagreed with previous leaders on.
In the convocation to the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday, it said “we want to meet inclusive and productive.”
In the last eight years my Labour MP has had Friday meetings would be just like that.
Unfortunately, today's meeting was not like that, and the promise of a "smart" policy has long been forgotten, if it was followed at all.
It has become increasingly clear that different viewpoints are not tolerated in Labour, and that each meaning is judged by the leaders of the party.
This happened shortly after Jeremy became a party leader, when colleagues I used to agree with suddenly expect me to change my mind and agree on matters I would never agree on - whether it was national security or the internal market in the European Union.
When I speak publicly, there's nothing to say about what I'm saying, I'm always told by social media and people want me to go off while they criticize central politics and say I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know that I am happier than some of my colleagues, because the comments against me are at least political.
I admire my colleagues who get the sex discriminating and racist sichikas targeting themselves every day, and who are still professional and not going off.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this time period is how normalized it has become to harass politicians.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour game should become more tolerant.
In the real world, we are no longer a tolerant party that has something for everyone. Every mistrust proposal and every change in the rules of the game, the party becomes narrower and narrower.
I have received many advice in the last two years from people who have said I have to take it easy and not be so loud, so maybe people will "like me better."
But that's not why I chose to join the politics.
When I joined Labour, when I was still in school 32 years ago, it was because I was mad at Thatcher and how the government failed the country. My classroom was falling apart, so I wanted better public services for those who need them most - if it was like local councillor or government minister.
I have never hidden my political meaning, nor in the previous elections.
Nobody in Nottingham East might have been in doubt about what I'm dealing with and who of the current leaders I don't agree with.
To those who vote for the Friday proposal, I can only say that when the country is heading towards a Brexit that will harm private, local businesses and public services, then I don't understand why people care about throwing away energy on asking questions about my loyalty to the Labour party leader.
But in fact, not the only message I have addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to the voters in the walnut, whether they're Labour voters or not: I'm proud to tone you, and I promise that no one can get me off or change my policy and prevent me from tying down the way I think is best for you all.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr goes to the top of Scottish rugby
Two sein 'tries' may change the result a bit, but there is no doubt that Ayr kept on winning in this very entertaining Tennent's Premiership match today.
They're now at the top of the pallet, the only unsurpassed layer of all ten.
It was the sovereign defense and the ability to take chances that gave them the home team and the coach, Peter Murchie, good reason to be sober.
"We've been tested in the last matches, and we're still invincible, so I have to be sober," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Ay fast pink, they were nicer than us to take chances."
Grant Anderson had a try for 14 minutes, where Frazier Climo tried a conversion, which put Ayr in front, but a yellow card from the Captain Rory Hughes from Warriors Lot Melrose gathered, and Jason Baggot took an unconverted try.
Climo got a punishment just before the break, he scora and 'converted' a 'solo try' to give Ayr 17-5 before the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's «try», which was «converted» by Baggot, reduced the spinal cord by five points.
A long break occurred when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and laid on a stretch, and from the reboot ayr went forward through a try from Stafford McDowall, such as Climo 'converted'.
The working captain of Ayr, Blair MacPherson, got yellow cards, and again Melrose tried an unconverted Bruce Colvine try, at the end of a series of aggressive games.
The home team played back, and then Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball from the penalty statement, scora MacPherson a ‘try’.
Climo ‘converted’ again after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong’s box kick and sent Gregor Henry away from his fifth ‘try’.
The stars from the Scottish series, Still Game, start a new career in the restaurant industry
The Scottish Still Game star, Ford Kieran, seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry, after it was discovered that he is the director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays together with the partner Greg Hemfill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth season is going to be the last, and it seems as if Kijen is planning life after Craiglang.
According to official lists, he is director of Aktridmorn Limited.
The shooter will not comment on the matter, but a source from the newspaper Scottish Sun has suggested that Klüber would be involved in the ‘progressive restaurant industry’ in Glasgow.
«The sea is ours»: Bolivia hopes that the court will open a waterway to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol marine headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings flags with sea blue flags.
The marine bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazonaselva are covered with the motto, "The sea is ours.
and the duty to return to it.»
In landlocked Bolivia, the people can still remember a coastline the country lost to Chile, in a bloody conflict about resources in the 1800s, they long to sail in the Pacific again.
This hope may be stronger than in many decades while Bolivia is awaiting the judgment of the International Court of Justice to come on 1 October, after five years of deliberation.
«Bolivia has drive, serenity and is single, and, of course, expects a positive result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians come to look at the International Court of Justice’s dismissal, hoping that the Hague Court will support Bolivia’s claim, and that, after decades of negotiations, Chile will provide Bolivia with a self-contained exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia -- who strives to be elected again next year -- has good reason to hope for a positive result.
«Now we soon get back to the Pacific," he promised late in August.
But some analysts don't think the court will allow Bolivia access to the sea -- and that little would have changed if they got access.
The Netherlands-based UN Court of Justice has no power to transfer Chilean territory to Bolivia and has determined that they will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the court's judgment comes only six months after the last hearing indicates that the case was 'not complicated', said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
The last four years have gone a long way from bringing up Bolivia's case, they've done the opposite.
‘The problem of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian administration,’ said Zárate.
Morales, with his contentious rhetoric, has killed what was of Chile's goodwill, Zárate meant.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue negotiations, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the issue afterwards.
Both countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who is Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will have an ‘exceptional opportunity to open up new relations with Chile’ and a chance to ‘put a line at 139 years of inconsistency and rather benefit both,’ he said.
Calzadilla also rejected that Morales, which is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used this maritime issue to win voices.
‘Bolivia will never give up the right of access to the Pacific;’ he added.
"The judgment is a possibility to see what we need to do to forget the past."
North Korea says they won't eliminate nuclear weapons if they can't trust the United States.
The North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, says that his nation can't be the first to give up if they can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He encouraged the United States to follow up on the rise they gave during the Singapore meeting between the American and North Korean leaders.
Ri's comments come at a time when the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pomepo, seems to want to start his locked nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that the United States has a false hope that North Korea will subdue itself if the United States persists in sanctions and opposes any statement of the end of the Korean war.
Washington refuses to agree to a possible declaration of the end of the war, without Pyongyang removing first.
Both Kim and the U.S. president, Donald Trump, will hold a new meeting.
But many are critical of Pyongyang's seriousness when it comes to degradation and that the country most likely sees its weapons as a guarantee of security.
Pompeo planned to visit Pyongyang next month to prejudge the second Kim Trump meeting.
Paris shows that massive headgear is the last fashion on the way to a handy near you
If you want to upgrade your hat collection or block the sun completely, you no longer need to search.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a number of large and special main pieces in their SS19 collection.
The highest impractical hats can be seen on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their shocking creations right on the catwalk.
The most magnificent garment was an lavish, beige Valentino hat with a feather-like, broom that covered the models' heads.
There was also another oversized addition during the fashion show, including a jewel-plucked watermelon, a trollman hat, and even a pineapple - but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a collection of bizarre masks - just in time before Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lips that were sewn together and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One of the creations is similar to diving equipment, complete with snorkel and mask, while another looks like a melted ice in biscuits.
If you like this hugely dramatic fashion, you can just look at it.
Fashion experts trace that the huge hats come for the hall in a handcuff near you.
The oversized hats come right after La Bomba, the straw hat with the 60 centimeters wide flame that has been seen on celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the highest impractical hat, which was everywhere on social media, has now sent out a new creation on the catwalk -- a straw beach bag of the same size as the bikini-dressed model that carried her.
The beach bag, with color of burnt orange and frowning the top with a white skin handle, was the most appealing part of Jacquemus’s La Riviera SS19 collection during fashion weeks in Paris.
“I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the fashion shops next summer – the designer has made such a big impression that I doubt that it is possible to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Global Citizens Need Language Knowledge
Private schools in Scotland are familiar with high academic levels, and this continues in 2018 with excellent examination results, which are only enhanced by individual and common success in sports, art, music and other social activities.
With over 30,000 elephants in all of Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Board of Independent Schools (SCIS), are working to offer the best services to students and their parents.
Self-serving schools aim to lead their students to higher education, career paths and the role of global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages are popular optional in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, the message goes to his heart."
This is an important reminder that we can't just learn English when we want to build relationships and trust in people from other countries.
By looking at the results of this year's exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the regular tables with the highest characteristics of independent scales.
A total of 68 percent of the elephants who took foreign language received A.
The data collected from SCI's 74 member schools shows that 72 percent of students had A in mandarin, while 72 percent of those who took German, 69 percent of those who took French, and 63 percent of those who took Spanish also got A.
This shows that self-employed schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital properties, which children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Language as an evaluator is considered equivalent to STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the syllabus of independent schools and other places.
An investigation carried out by the 2014 UK Add & Property Selection showed that 17 per cent of employers failed to fill the settings due to lack of knowledge of the language of the applicants.
It is therefore increasingly important for languages in the school to guide young people into working life.
With more linguistic skills, these properties are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever kind of career a youth is good, if they've learned a different language, they have a decent advantage in the future with such a property.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov investigation of more than 4,000 adults in 2013, 75 percent could not speak any languages other than English well enough to hold a conversation walking, and French was the only language that was spoken by a two-off percentage, 15 percent.
This is why it is so important to invest in language training for our children.
Being able to use more languages, especially the languages used in developing countries, can give children a better chance of finding good jobs in the future.
In Scotland, each school is different when it comes to the language in which they teach.
Many schools focus on the classic modern languages, while others teach in languages that are classified as important in the United Kingdom when we look forward to 2020, as for example mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be a lot of languages to choose from in self-employed schools, and teachers specialising in this area.
Scottish self-contained schools are dedicated and want to create a learning environment that will guide children and give them the properties they need to close, no matter what future causes.
One cannot deny that in this global, business-oriented environment, languages are vital for the future of the country, so this needs to be reflected in the education sector.
Modern languages should be referred to as ‘international communication characteristics’.
Self-serving schools will continue to offer this choice, thus offering shortages and high competences for Scotland's young people.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

LeBron debuts in Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Waitetida is soon across the street from fans looking to see LeBron James debuters at the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team.
Lakers Coach Luke Walton has announced that James will be playing in the pre-season match on Sunday, against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how long he's been playing hasn't been determined yet.
‘It’s going to be more than one minute and less than 49,’ Walton published on Lakers’ official website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, tweet that James is most likely to play for a limited time.
After this week's training, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' schedule for the preseason.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to get me ready," he said.
Trumps West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube
President Donald Trump starts on a whirlwind of campaigns tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
That's the first of Trump's five planned stop the coming week, including stopping at friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation system waiting to select the vacant position of the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the upcoming mid-way elections as Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when voting is due in November.
How time is Trump going to be in West Virginia tonight, and how can you view it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00 p.m. in the evening, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can see Trump's West Virginia collection online below, via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably record this week's hearings of Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh, who became excited about sexual abuse debts, with an expected confirmatory voice from the Senate waiting for a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the primary goal of this jacket of collections is to help Republicans meet the November elections and get some momentum (moving force).
This is how President Trump’s campaign says that these five collections in the next week are directed towards ‘upgrading volunteers and followers as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority of them in the Senate and the House of Representatives’, according to Reuters.
‘Congress control is so critical of his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible when we enter the busy campaign season,’ said a Trump campaign spokesman who refused to be informed to Reuters.
Planned for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the collection for the evening can bring support from «Ohio and Pennsylvania and withdraw coverage from Pittsburgh media», following West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who's been requested in the polls.
'It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come and try to give him a raise in the polls,' said Simon Haeder, a political researcher at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team United States shows stomach for battle to keep hope alive on singles on Sunday
After three unilateral sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes could only be what this Ryder Cup had to do.
The swinging pendulum of the moment is a completely invented sports grip, but one that the players really believe in, and never more than on competitors like these.
So where would they say that momentum is now?
"They had a six-point rental, and now it's four, so we take it as a little moment, I guess," said Jordan Spieth as he strolled off the day before.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of four points leading to twelve more in games.
The Americans, as Spieth says, know that they have some wind in their sails, and they have a lot to encourage, not least shape to Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day, and each has three points from four.
Spieth has been mortal from tea to green and rents after example.
The guttural screams of the celebration were higher as his round continued, seeking an important putt to take match four all-squao.re when he and Thomas had been two down after two.
His put that won the fight at 15, was met with a similar scream, the type that told you that he thinks the American team isn't out of this.
"You've only got to dig deeply and worry about your own fight," said Spieh.
There are all these players left now.
18 holes to create an emblem.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the invincible history of Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange, but pretty couple are four from four and can't do anything wrong.
«Moliwood» was the only couple that would not shoot a bowey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine (the last nine holes on a track with 18 holes) on Friday morning.
That race, and the way their energy seems to float to and from this noisy, enthusiastic audience, asserts that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there wouldn't be any more popular players to seal a potential European saying when the sun goes down over Le Golf National, than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
Talk about European honours will be too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did short work by Sergio Garcia, the morning four-ball hero, when he was the couple with Alex Noren.
One bowey and two doubles on the first nine, the rough spanjolen and the Swedish into a hole they never got near to climbing out of.
But on Sunday, no one can help you get out of your hole.
The fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to look at closely because of the interaction between opponents, the advice they give, and the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change at an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and takes a significant rent into the last day, but this foursome session also showed that Team America has the stomach for the fight that someone, especially Stateside, had doubted.
Europe takes the 10-6 lead in Ryder Cup final
Europe will have a healthy advantage in the last day of the Ryder Cup after coming out from the four-balls and foursome games with a 10-6 rental over the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a giant Tiger Woods to take their fight so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side offered to keep the trophy they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a misguided American side tomorrow fourballs, and took the series 3-1.
U.S. added more resistance to foursomes and won two battles, but they couldn't get the bottom.
Jim Fury's page needs eight points from the 12 single matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row while he and Molinari, called 'Molliwood' after a startling weekend, is only the second pair to win four points from their opening in four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After breaking Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they turned out so great to beat an outcast Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more coveted 5 and 4.
Woods, who roamed through two games on Saturday, showed sporadic brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-balls and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who slept for the morning fourballs, returned to the party Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2nd and 1 defeat by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe did not get everything they wanted on a pleasant, windy day south-west of Paris.
Three times grand wins Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas put the reference to Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a brave 2 & 1 says about Spain's Jon Rahman and Ian Poulter in fourballs and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursomes when they had lost the two holes in the opening.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history, a layer has returned from a four-point layer and entered single, although as a holder, the Fury's page only needs to draw to keep the trophy.
After being the second best for two days, it still looks as if a Sunday mot attack would be outside of them.
North Korea says it doesn't matter to rust down unilaterally without trust
The Foreign Minister of North Korea told the United Nations that if sanctions continued to increase the mistrust of the United States, and that the country would in no way give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the World Power that North Korea had done ‘significant measures’ to improve the situation in the past year, for example, they have stopped nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear test site and promised not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we don't get anything corresponding back from the United States," he said.
‘Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances, it is not possible for us to disarm unilaterally first.’
While Ri, a well-known North Korean, has made several complaints about Washington's resistance to a ‘phasic’ approach to the abolition of nuclear weapons, where North Korea would be paid to take gradual steps, his roots proved significant in that he did not reject unilateral nuclear degradation, as Pyongyang has done before.
Ri referred to a joint statement published by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit ever between a sitting American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work for ‘reducing nuclear power on the Korean peninsula’, while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea’s security.
North Korea has wanted a formal end to the Korean War from 1950-53, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to facilitate tough international sanctions in North Korea.
"The United States insists on "reducing nuclear power first" and increases the pressure with sanctions to achieve its purpose by coercion, and they oppose even "the declaration of peace", said Ri.
"The belief that sanctions can break us is a false hope among those who are not interested in us.
But the problem is that when the sanctions continue, our distrust will only be greater."
Nothing about the plans for a new summit between Kim and Trump, as the U.S. president pointed out earlier this week in the United Nations.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae-in, the last five months and added: "If the party in this uprising to the decommissioning of nuclear weapons was South Korea, and not the United States, the decline in the Korean peninsula would not have stopped as it has now done."
Yet the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the general assembly in F.N. that it was not possible to stop North Korean rockets against the mainland of the United States, after President Trump called Kim a rocketman on suicide missions.
Trump, who last year threatened to ‘totally destroy’ North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much work still had to be done and that sanctions had to remain in place in North Korea disbanding his nuclear weapon.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a time frame for this, and said, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that F.N. Security Council should pay Pyongyang for the measures that are being taken.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told F.N.’s Security Council on Thursday: ‘The sanctions for the Security Council must continue to be maintained vigorously and without failing until we get the complete, final, verified resolution of the nuclear weapons.’
The Swedish Social Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to scrape funds into Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile program.
Pompeo met Ri on the sideline of the F.N. General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang next month again to prepare a new summit meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said it had made progress, but few hours later he condemns North Korea to come up with “gangster-like demands.”
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and also an atomic complex if the United States did "appropriate measures".
He said that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he applied for were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore, and stepped against normalizing the relationship with Washington.
Harvard students take courses in getting enough sleep
This year, a new course at Harvard University has helped all the students get more sleep, in an effort to fight against the growing macho culture of studying in caffeine all night long.
An academic found that high-level students often carelessly when it comes to the most basic -- how to take care of yourself.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he thinks is the first of his battles in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the effect sleep deprivation has on learning.
‘At the end of it, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why am I being told this now, in growing age?’
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleeping-- something that surprised me, he said to the Telegraph.
The course, rolled out for the first time this year, explains what is important for how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve the general well-being of them.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and managing director of the health services at the university, said that the university decided to introduce the course after the students had a serious sleep disorder during the week.
The hour course involves a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a dorm, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to be told about the effect of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, and how important it is with evening routines.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of campuses, with interactive icons, prompts participants to think about their daily routines.
'We know it doesn't want to change the behavior of elephants right away.
But we think they have the right to know-- just like you have the right to know, the health effects by choosing to smoke cigarettes, Prof. Czeisler added.
The culture of pride of days still exists, he said and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that lack of sleep is an increasing problem.
The assurance that you're getting enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's secret weapon against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said -- even to avoid getting up to weight, because lack of sleep puts the brain in swallowing mode and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, after being a student with him last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eye and inspired him to press on to get a course for the whole campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study program before they start the prestigious institution.
Prof. Czeisler advised that students should consider setting an alarm when going to bed, and besides when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" coming from electronic screens and LED lighting, which can convert the internal clock completely, leading to problems in sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga targets give Gerrard's men a ride down
Rangers went on a new defeat on the run when Dolly Menga's post sent Steven Gerrard's excellent page to a 1-0 loss on Livingston.
Ibrox's page was looking for its first story on the way away since the 4-1st Triumph of St Johnstone in February, but made for Gary Holt spring safari only Gerrard's second defeat on 18 matches as leader, and gave eight points, a round under Ladbrokes's leadership of the Premier League, Hearts.
Menga beat up to seven minutes before half-time, and a ranger statement with a lack of inspiration never seemed to have to equalize.
While Rangers now fall down to the sixth place, Livingston climbs to the third and is just behind the Hibernian on goal distinction.
And there may be additional problems in storage for Rangers after the lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a wound in his head, after an object apparently was thrown away from the outside.
Gerrard made eight changes to the layer that feia Ayr entered Betfred Cup semifinalane.
Holt, on the other hand, went with Livy 11 who took a point with a drum shot last week, and he would have been excited about the way that the fieldilla attracted his suffocating roof took on his opponents on each shift.
Rangers might have had the ball the most, but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They should have scora after only two minutes when Menga's first post sends Scott Pittman over to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midwayer fails in his combat style.
A long free park from Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, was only able to shoot a long shot at the retreat.
Rangers took control, but it seemed to be more hope than they believed in their game in the last third round.
Alfredo Morello's knowledge was determined that he would have punished the 20-meter mark when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson waved away the wish of the Colombian.
Rangers were able to target only two shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly concerned by Lassana Coulibaly's head and a tame shot from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening in the 34th minute may have been against the players' eyeballs, no one can deny that they only told it because of the shot.
Once again, Rangers failed to handle a deep death ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher beat the ball to Scott Robinson, who thought himself fun to pick out Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard took the break as if he were replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and replaced the spring break an immediate effect when the winger created a hatch for Morelos, but the impressive Kelly raced forward to block.
But Livingstone continues to outsmart the guest team to play exactly the game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett sending forward the long shots on the long shots.
Holt's teams could have increased the lead at the end, but McGregor liked to prevent Jacobs in it, until Lithgrow left a long post from the corner marker.
The reserve for Ranger, Glenn Middleton, had a new penalty claim when he supported along with Jacobs, but again Thomson overlooked it.
Almanac: Founder of the Geigerteljar
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today, and we REKNAR ... the day when he who was to become physicist Johannes Wilhelm «Hans» Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger teller.
As a scientific carrier since then, the Geiger teller was also a bearer of pop culture, as in the 1950 'Bels of Coronado' film, with seemingly improbable late cowboy researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: ‘It is a Geiger counter, it can be used to find radioactive minerals, for example uranium.
When you turn on these earphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that come from the radioactivity in the minerals.’
Evans: ‘Yes, no bubble it!’
«His» Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that asks his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can learn the immune system to "see" red cells.
New cancer vaccine can learn the immune system to "see" red cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise red cells, as part of the treatment

A sample vaccine shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with vaccine, who taught the immune system to recognize red cells, found that the ovary cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory, so that they can “see” a protein that is common in many cancers, called HER2, and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “ drives the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, pulmonary and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extract immune cells from patients and ‘learn’ them how they target cancer cells has worked by treating a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West ordered a pro-trump-diatribe, wearing a MAGA-lue, after he hosted the TV show Saturday Night Live.
It wasn't that good.
Kanye West was outperforming in the studio during Saturday Night Live after an amazing performance in which he praised the United States President, Donald Trump, and said he would set to election in 2020.
After taking his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, where he was wearing a Make America Great-caps, he gave the democrats a tiger and repeated his support to Trump.
"How many times do I talk to a white person, and they say, "How could you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago, he said.
SNL starts the show with a number together with comicist Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star fooled Brett Kavanaugh's witness in the Senate's judicial selection of the guilt of sexual assault from Christine Blasey Ford.
Even if it was not sent, West's recording was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to mock West with the article.
The West also complained to the audience that he had the difficult backstage because of his headgear.
‘They bullied me behind the scene.
They said, don't go out there with that hat on.
They bullied me!
And then they say I'm in a submerged place," he said, according to Washington Examinor.
West continued: 'Do you want to see the submerged space?' he said, 'put on the superman cap, because this means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?

His comments led to at least two outpings from the audience, and SNL cast members were embarrassingly concerned, reported Variety, with a person there who told the publication: "The whole studio was deadlocked."
West was brought in as a signal replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, when her former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confused many with a performance of the song I Love it, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the chairman of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner as twitter: «To one of the most brave spirits: TAKE FOR YOU TO OBJECT THE PIEBEL.»
But talkshow-vertinna Karen Hunter twitterra that West «likely was just like him and it's absolutely amazing.»
‘But I did NOT choose to pay anyone (by buying his music or dressing or by supporting his ‘art’) whom I believe embraces and ask out ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
That is what we are doing.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and said that he was now «officially known as Kanye West».
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Medrappar, Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion and, of course, the last musical legend Prince, changed the name to a symbol and then the artist who was formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington goes against toxic masculineity
Kit Harington is familiar with the swordswing role of being Jon Snow in HBO's optional medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the shooter, 31, has gone out against the macho hero stereotype, saying that such roles on the screen often lead to young boys feeling they have to be tough to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he thinks something has gone wrong and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he knew quite well to address the problem.
"Personally, I'm overconfident that something has gone wrong with the masculineity." he said.
‘What have we taught men when they grow up, when it comes to the problem we see now?’
Kit suggests that TV is partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculineity due to very male characters.
He goes on: 'What is innate and what is learned?'
What's learned on TV and in the streets, what makes young boys feel like they have to be this particular side of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change it?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men.'
In the interview he also admitted that he would not make Game of Thrones precursors or sequences when the series ends in summer and says he is ‘complete with battlefields and horses’.
From November Kit will play in a new recording of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The shooter recently revealed that he is looking at the meeting with his wife, Rose, to be the best that came out of the Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this show, so that way it gave me my future family and my life further," he said.
Rose played Ygrite, the decorator of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are in the country, says health supplement.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were transferred through six, and marked a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who received HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, said Chinese health professionals at a conference in Yunnan Province.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT/HBTQ people is claimed to be widespread.
Because of the conservative values in the country, students have counted that 70-90% of men having sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transfers of disease men come from improper sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an attempt to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters nectar to add layer information from the GOP senator, it explodes in 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiration theories'.
The United States Rep. Maxine Waers condemned on Saturday claims that a member of her staff had published personal information about three Republican American senators on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The Los Angeles Democratic Party claimed that the claims were pedalised by extrem-right-fløh investigations and web pages.
"Lives, lies and more contemptible lies," said Waters in a question on Twitter.
The published information included informational addresses and telephone numbers for the Americans Sens. Lindsey Graham in South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday, was sent by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on the guilt of sexual assault against the Supreme Court-elected Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came once after the three senators had asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Poundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the post was associated with the Waters' office and released the information of a member of the Waters' staff, Hill reported.
‘This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie,’ continues Waters.
‘One of my additions — who has been compromised by their identity, personal information and security as a result of these unreasonable and false claims — was by no means responsible for the leakage of this information.
This baseless claim is entirely false and an absolute lie."
The queries to Water quickly got criticism on the web, among others from former Press Secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
‘This denial is angry’, wrote Fleischer.
‘This suggests that she has no temperament to be a member of the Congress.
When someone gets blamed for something they didn't do, they don't have to be angry.
They don't have to be tough.
They must not ask questions about the motives for the debtor.
They must be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer proved to compare Water's reaction to the criticism of the democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, who was owed by critics to be apparent for anger during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate trying to take over Water's place in the Midway elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if it's true," he tweeted.
In the preceding question, Waters said that her office had warned "the right powers of government and the law enforcement units of these false claims.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed,” she continues, “and that they will be held legally responsible for all of their actions that are devastating and dangerous for each and every one of my employees.”
Johnny English strikes again - spying tull of weak Rowan Atkinson
It's traditional to look for Brexit brands in all new films with a British angle, and it works for this revival of Johnny England's action-comedie spoof-franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will self-ironic satire about how open-minded we are become the new export potential of the country?
In any case, the great-god, incompetent Johnny English with the rubber duck has for the second time been given his new permission to fuck things up -- his name signals more than anything else that he is a broad comic book for cinema scientists in non-English-speaking countries.
He is, of course, the foolish, secret agent who failed in his bizarre desire to spread some glamour has got a little bit of Clouseau, a dash of Mr Bean and a portion of the guy who contributes a simple tune to the Firecars, theme during the Olympic Opening Ceremony in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the travelling and international mystery man Atkinson once played in the no-forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, something that left chaos behind.
There's one or two fine eyelashes in this last JE escape.
I love Johnny English as he approaches a helicopter while he was dressed in a medieval armor suit while the rotor blades hit his helmet.
Atkinson’s gift to physical comedy is on the screen, but the humor is quite weak and strangely superfluous, especially since ‘serious’ movie brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible even now safely offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor felt as if he were directed at children instead of the vaccines, and to me Johnny England's noisy accident is not as ingenious and focused as Atkinson's relics are played in the person in Bean.
The current permanent provision is that the United Kingdom is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the U.K.'s super-secret web network of spies, which reveals the identities of all agents in the United Kingdom, to the dismay of the agent at work -- a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a prime minister who's a pompous and warlord figure, who already has a complete breakdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does his very best with this quasi-Theresa-May character, but it's not that much in the script to work with.
Her intelligence counselors inform her that when every active spy has his debt, she has to pick up someone who's retired.
And that means that the incompetent Johnny English himself, who works as a teacher at some elegant establishment, but gives unofficial lessons about how to work undercover: a couple of fine jokes here, since English offers a School of Rock-type Academy for Espionage.
English is sent back to Whitehall for a emergency briefing and reunite with his former understanding assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, moving over to a submarine driver's job, an overestimating role where Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin's ability to get things to become terrible mad in Hennar Majesty's secret services are back for full in the meeting with Olga Kurylenko's beautiful five fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the prime minister was dangerously under the spell of the charismatic technology of the billionaire, claiming he could solve the UK's data problem: the creepy Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of farce-like wild games: disguised as waitresses, set them at a fine French restaurant; they create chaos and smuggle on board Volta's pleasure boat; and English triggers pure anarchy as he tries to use a virtual reality headset to make himself familiar with the interior of Volta's house.
All stops are probably pulled out to the last sequence, but as loving and unexploited as it is, there's a lot of children's TV all over the place.
Quite moderate things.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
The Labour Party refused that they were working out a plan for the English to work a four-day week, but were paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyns Labour Party is now considering a radical plan that wants the British to work a four-day week - but gets paid for five.
According to the report, the party intends to send further savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.
That would add a three-day weekend - but still get the same salary.
Sources said the idea would "pass" with the economic agenda of the party and plan to increase benefits for workers.
The change to a four-day week has been approved by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changed economy.
An older source from Labour told The Sunday Times: A policy message is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It does not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a desire that fits into the approach the party has to balance the economy for the benefit of the worker, as well as assigning to the party its industrial strategy.'
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week in its 2017 election campaign.
However, the ambition is not accepted by the whole Labour game.
A Labour spokesperson said: 'The four-day working week is not a party policy and it is not considered by the party.'
Shadow chancellor John McDonnell used the last week's work conference to reinforce his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to take power back from ‘faithless directors’ and ‘profits’ in rich businesses.
The plans of the shadow chancellor also mean that current shareholders in a water supply cannot recover their entire efforts as a Labour Government could do "deduction" due to perceived misbehavior.
He has also confirmed plans to add 10 percent of the equity of private sector corporations, which would receive annual dividends of up to £500, about $5,000.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, said in the 60 Minutes TV program that the FBI's in search of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI investigation of complaints against judges Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to Supreme Court for at least one week, and it raises the question of how far found to the Agency could affect some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview sent on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley in '60 Minutes' asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seems more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"My self, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said on the way into the hearing, I said, I have spoken with the judges Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, that statement came out and said, 'Have you done it?'
He was destined, fixed, expedient.»
Graham's voice nevertheless seemed to be seen in stone.
"I have made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would take a dynamite charge to change me," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it, "La Graham to, and referred to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all her names couldn't verify it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday is New York's host to the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an enormously impressive layout of stars that act and an equally impressive mission; ending poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flocking to Central Park's large lawn, not only to enjoy watching Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes perform, but also to raise awareness of the true goal of the event of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to obtain a free ticket for the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concert hosts had to complete a number of tasks, or ‘actions’ as voluntary work; emailing a world leader, calling a phone call or other meaningful ways of helping to raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen been with 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way to persuade people to demand a call for action, or just another case of so-called ‘clickivism’ - people feel that they make a real difference by signing an online appeal or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million ‘actions’ from its support players and participated in and pressed for a variety of goals.
It is said that these actions have helped world leaders to announce commitments and policies that amount to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group of 390 obligations and notices related to their actions, including at least $10 billion already paid or collected, appeared.
So far, the group estimates that the Sikhs have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important obligations are The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and employers who are obliged to ‘help children reach their full potential’; promises to give Rwanda 35 million dollars to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 tweets from global citizens.
‘With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history;’ - told the ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after taking more than 5000 actions to demand that the United Kingdom improves nutrition for mothers and children, the UK government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition treatment.
In answer to one of the usual questions on the website’s page, they ask “what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global citizens replied: "There will be a long and difficult way--sometime we will fall and fail.
But as the major civil rights and anti-apartheid movements lead us, we will be happy because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the actors who appear at this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furnesss and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the fleet as a block to prevent Russian energysports Secretary.
Washington may ‘if necessary’ resort to its fleet to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, international secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, especially where they operate at the invitation of the legitimate government, is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
‘I believe that they are in the Middle East, that they want to distribute energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe,’ he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to tackle it.
"The United States has this potential, with our fleet, to ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy is not on the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants on the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal group presenting itself as the energy consumer’s voice in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are actually the same.
‘The economic solution of Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels,’ he said, referring to Russia as an ‘one-trick pony’ with an economy depending on fossil fuels.
The statements made by the Trump Administration are intended to increase the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, and to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
In this connection, service staff in Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump, try to persuade Germany to withdraw from the inappropriate Nord Stream 2 tube project, which according to Trump made Berlin the 'capture' of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly underlined that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity of 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's eager resistance to the project is only driven for economic reasons, and is a example of unfair competition.
‘I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,’ said the Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Novak after a meeting with US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The American holding company has withdrawn a setback from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has encouraged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
‘I have a big problem when a third country disrupts our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, leader of the German Industrial Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between German chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to "run hard" to be Presidential candidate in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would take a "stupid look" at being a presidential candidate after the midway elections.
During a Council house meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider attending as a candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our stupid government, and it includes a woman on top," she said according to The Hill.
‘After 6 November, I will consider in detail to be a Presidential candidate.’
Warren addressed President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting and said he ‘leads this country in the wrong direction’.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren has been crass in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court Board Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the reconciliation."
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren’s own voters do not think that she should be a candidate in 2020.
51 percent of the "probable" Massachusetts voters said that the senator should not act as a candidate, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/ Boston Globe investigation.
Thirty-two percent support such a candidate.
The investigation showed more support for a round of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidate and 48 percent against.
Other highly profiled democratic names discussed with regard to a potential 2020 candidate include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
The bid said that he would decide officially in January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin argues for Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump Collection
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after being reverended in September.
He was arrested and accused of a electoral event in his home on Monday evening
"Whatever my own son goes through, what he goes through when he comes back, makes it possible for me to relate to other families that are emblazoned by PTSD and some of the wounds with which our solar data returns," she said to the audience at a collection for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they come back a little changed, they come back hard, they come back and wonder about the respect for what they and fellow soldiers and pilots and all the other military, have done for the country, exists".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was guilty of physical power in the home against a woman, to have disturbed a report about the power of the home and the custody of a weapon while he was rushing, following Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. challenge to support new asylum policies
Eighteen states and districts of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new American policy that relinquishs asylum to victims of refugees from repatriation or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and districts submitted a friend-of-right on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenges politics, reported NBC News.
The plaintiff's full name in Grace v. Sessions fits that American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Liberties Union) filed in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said that her partner ‘and the electoral union sons’ abused her, but American officials refused her application for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers of the States supporting Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produce a large number of applicants for American asylum, as nations face pervasive problems of forces and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision from the Immigration Act, which allowed illegal immigrants to flee from power in the world to apply for asylum.
The District of Columbia Minister of Justice Karl Racine said on a Friday morning that the new policy “ignores many decades of government, federal and international law.”
‘Federal law requires that all asylum cases be judged for the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such an obstacle to this principle,’ said the friend-of-court card.
Advocates further claim in the summary that the policy of refusing access harms the economy of the United States, and that it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and ‘provide necessary work’.
Advocate General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges no longer to grant asylum to victims of refugee abuse and repatriation in June.
‘Asyl is available to those who have left their home country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political meaning,’ said Sessions in its publication of the policy on 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems - even all serious problems - that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue work in Palu while the dead-stalked doblast in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was becoming more serious.
‘It is very tense,’ said the 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who comforted his feverish baby son at an evacuation centre in the devastated town of Palu.
‘Each minute ambulances come with bodies.
Pure water is difficult to find.»
Inhabitants are observed on their way back to their ruined homes, searching through water-damaged property and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals that were destroyed by the earthquake, which had a strength of 7.5, were overfilled.
Some of the injuries, including Dwi Haris, who had broken his back and shoulder, were resting outside of Palu's Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to the continued strong aftershock.
Tears filled his eye as he told him that he knew the powerful earthquake shook the hotel room he shared with his wife and the daughter on the fifth floor.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I believe, « Haris told the Associated Press, and added that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador owes China for “mobbing” with “propaganda ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper launched a four-page advertising in an American daily newspaper highlighting the mutual benefits of trading with the United States and China, the American ambassador against China blamed Beijing for using the American press to spread propaganda.
The United States President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily's paid advances in the Des Moines register - the state of Iowa's largest salsavis - after having owed China to try to interfere in the US Congress elections on November 6, a debt China nectars for.
Trump's debt that Beijing tried to interfere in American elections marked what American servicemen told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign government agencies to post advertising to support trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an increasing trade war that has seen them increase taxes on each other's imports.
China's retaliation tariff early in the trade war was designed to meet exporters in states like Iowa that support Trump's Republican party, Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the American ambassador to China and the former long-standing governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural product to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
“China”, wrote Branstad in a sentence in the Sunday’s Des Moines register, “doubles no bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press.”
‘In its dissemination of propaganda, the Chinese government benefits from America’s dear tradition of freedom of speech and a free press by including a paid advertisement in the Des Moines register,’ Branstad wrote.
‘In contrast, by the newspaper’s downwards street here in Beijing, you will find the delimiting voices and will not see any true reflection of the various meanings that the Chinese people may have on China’s problematic economic path, given that the media is below the fixed thumb of the Chinese Communist Party’ he shouted.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers refused the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say what a newspaper.
Republicans forward female voters leading the mid-term with Kavanaugh Debacle, warning analysts.
As many top republicans are stand-by and defend the Supreme Court-elected Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple sexual assaults, the analyst has warned that they will probably see a setback, especially from women, in the coming midpoints.
The feelings around this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have recorded that they already wanted to move on with one voice.
These things cannot be undone, says Grant Reeher, professor of state science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, to The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last glance at the pressure of an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday--they won't forget it tomorrow, and not November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday. Washington, DC-avis.
On Friday morning, Protestants sang "November is coming!" while they demonstrated in the hall of the Senate when the Republicans, who run the court committee, chose to proceed with the Kavanaugh's nomination failed in the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic.
‘Democracyal enthusiasm and motivation will be beyond the chart,’ said Stu Rothenberg, a non-party political analyst, to the news page.
'People say it's already high, that's true.
But there may be higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29-year-olds, who, while not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony, which detailedly stated the claims of sexual assault directed against the appointment of the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a setback should be followed if the Republicans press forward with confirmation.
‘This has been a confused mess for GOP,’ said Michael Steele, formerly leader of the National Republical Committee, early in the previous week, following NBC News.
‘It’s not just about voting for the committee or final reconciliation or whether Kavanaugh is on the bench, it’s also about how Republicans have handled this and how they have treated it,” Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to select democrats, pointing to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to be a little bit divided over who they should trust in in the wake of Ford's and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little bit more siding with the latter.
A new meaning measurement from YouGov shows that 41 percent of the respondents definitely or probably threatened Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably threatened Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they believed that Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying under his witness, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the claims made by Ford, and besides at least another complaint, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford witnessed to the Senate judicial committee during the last week that Kavanaugh completely assaulted her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her sexual organs while they attended a party during the time they studied at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet to meet Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company built by Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where data is stored and which people have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said that the meaning of Inrupt is ‘world domination’.
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
‘It’s a historic eye flash.’
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own personal online repository or a POD.
It may include contact lists, memory lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Drive; Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser and all at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online store is that it is completely up to the user who can access any kind of information.
The company calls it ‘personal authority through data’.
The idea of Inrupt, according to the managing director of the company John Bruce, is that the company should include resources, process and appropriate capabilities to make Solid available to all.
The company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM and some additional developers contracted to work with the project, as well as a community of voluntary encoders.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt Web site.
Berners-Lee said he and his team didn't talk to "Facebook and Google about not introducing a complete change where all their business models are completely turned over the night.
"We are not asking their permissions."
In an article on media published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network collection built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee Internet transformed when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a voice with great influence in the debate on net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
‘I’m unbelievably optimistic about this next era on the web,’ said Berners-Lee ten l.
Bernard Water: WW1 Victoria Cross divine celebration
The divinity of the only English church that won a Victoria cross during the first world war as a fighter, has been celebrated in its hometown 100 years later.
Lt Col Pastor Bernard Vann won the prize on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was still killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the highest British military honor.
A memorial was abducted by his two grandchildren on a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "brilly symbolic," that the stone would be drained exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning performance.
According to London Gazette, Lt Col Vann led his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918, “through a very thick shod and under heavy fire from fields and machine guns.”
He later ran up to the front line, and with the "greatest gala" he led the line forward before he first rushed forward with a field gun and struck out three of the group.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - a little over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "I know that I could never live up to, but something I'm humbled for."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he was very honored to play a role in the parade, and added that “the value of a real hero is shown by the support of many people.”
The MMA fan was up all night to see Bellator 206, they got Peppa Gris instead.
Imagine, you've been up all night to see a package of Bellator 206 but you can't see the main event.
The San Jose bill contained 13 matches, including six on the main map and was shown live through the night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, right in the Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald, they're about to meet each other, where viewers in the United Kingdom again stunned when the coverage changes to Peppa Gris.
Some were little impressed after they had stayed awake to the early hours especially for the fight.
A tab on Twitter described the children's comic book as "some sort of sick joke."
‘It is public regulation that the 6 o’clock in the hole was not owned this way, they had to switch to the program for the children,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president for marketing and communication, when he was asked about the transfer.
‘ Peppa pig, ‘yes’.
Bellator Company President Scott Coker said they're going to work on planning to include British viewers in the future.
'I believe that when I think about replay, I believe we can probably figure it out,' said Coker.
«But the time is six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday, and we can't figure this out before Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
True to me, when it went over, there were many texts going back and forth, and everyone wasn't friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't; it was a public problem.
I can promise you, the next time it doesn't happen.
We keep it to five games instead of six -- which we usually do -- and we tried to deliver to the fan, and we just went over.
There is an unfortunate situation.»
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley knew himself underage because of sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that in his awakening he felt worse than everyone because of his sexuality-- but that gave him the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand until he went to the continuing school that "not everyone is like me."
When he spoke on the first Radio 4 Desert Island discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about his gay dishes to give others hope.
He also said becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The permanent reporter in the long run showa, Kirsty Young, has taken free several months because of illness.
What could look like a waste in Lavender's first program, Daly said he knew himself 'less than' all the others who grew up because 'it wasn't socially acceptable to equal boys and girls.'
He said, "From today, having a sense of feeling less than and different, are the real things that have given me the strength and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "noko," he said, so that he didn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic medal has been a professional LGBT campaign and used its appearance at the Year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he knew himself lucky who could live up without dissensions and wanted to give others 'hope'.
The three-way world champion said that it would be indignant in a man -- the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 -- "surprising me."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than he, last year, but he said that the age difference never had a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he went to his first 14-year-old OL and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar heights and depressions.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his whole perspective had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I need to win a gold medal," he said.
«You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
Mi Olympic gold medal is Robbie.»
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after having been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he should die and one of the last things he had asked about was if they had tickets to London in 2012 - when he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him you're not going to be on the top row," he said.
"I kept working when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally realized he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the OL in 2012 and water bronze.
"I only knew that this was what I had dreamed about my whole life--to dive into the front of a world audience in an Olympic game, where there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired the first choice of his song--proud by Heather Small--that had vibrated with him in the construction of the OL and he still gave goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out of shape his Mickelson on the bench at Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47. Ryder Cup match, but he must reverse his form to avoid that there is an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who played in the two-year event for a record 12 times, was seen on the bench of Captain Jim Fury in front of Saturday's golf game in the fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five times the great winner's day split between being a cheerleader and working with his game within the scope of hope of correcting what bothers him.
Never the most competent long shots. Not ending at the top of their career, the 48-year-old is best hit with the long shot on the throne, the French main course, where balls hit outside if the golf player is not exactly hit.
And if the course itself isn't terrifying enough, Mickelson meets in the ninth battle on Sunday, the precise British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches they've won this week.
If the Americans, four points down by starting the 12 single games, get to a hot start, Mickelson's fight can be completely decisive.
Fear expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say much else.
"He totally understood the role he had today, gave me a clapping on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Fury.
‘He has great confidence in himself.
He is a Hall of Famer, and he has added so much to these layers in the past and this week.
I didn't think he played two games.
I saw more for myself, but that's how it was, and that's how we thought we had to do.
He will be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record in most Ryder Cup games that are played on Sunday.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never completely matched the heights of its individual record.
Mikkelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven halves, even though Fury so that his proximity added some intangible properties to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, entertaining, likes to have fun with people and he's a nice guy to have in the room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun getting around with him too, this week, which was fun to see.
He contributes a lot more than just playing.’
Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that much lead can soon disappear
Thomas Bjørn, the European Captain, knows from experience that a significant rental on the way into the last few days of the Ryder Cup can easily be transformed into an unpleasant trip.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side captain of Seve Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans, but only came across the finish line with the nose leading with the narrowest margins, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big rental on Valderrama; we had a big rental on Brookline, where we lost, and on Valderrama, where we won, but only so far," said Björn, after he had seen the Class 2018 win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to rent 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
You're going to the full opening tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
This is not until you have the score for the board.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus stays.
I've said all the time, I'm focusing on the 12 players that are on our side, but we're very well aware of what's on the other side -- the biggest players in the world."
Rejoicing how his players have performed on a tough golf course, Bjørn added: "I would never take the saying in advance.
Tomorrow is another day.
Tomorrow, there's the individual achievements that come out, and there's another thing to do.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there individually, you'll be testing full of your capacity as a golfer.
It's the message you need to pass on to players; get the best of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner, and he must go and get the best of himself too."
In contrast to Bear, opposite Jim Fury's number will be on lookout after his players perform better individually than they did as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who fetched three points out of four.
Fear itself has been at both ends of the spin-offs of the great last days, after being part of the winning team in Brookline before he ended up losing when Europe pulled off the 'Miracle in Medinah'.
"I think every fucking word of it," he said in response to being asked about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, had gathered his players on the way in the last day.
«We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to get started with the quick start that you saw on Brookline, as you saw on Medinah.
When the moment passes, put a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
We set up our line-up accordingly and set the boys in motion in a way that's felt good, you know, we're trying to do something magical tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned the task of trying to lead the game and meet Rory McIlroy at the top of the game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahman, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the game.
"I went with this group of boys in this order because I believe it covers the whole way through," Bjorn said about his choices of singles.
Germany’s new warships once again
The newest frigate of the German Navy would have been ordered in 2014 to replace aging warships from the cold wartime, but it will not be there until at least next year due to faulty system and apparent costs, reported local media.
The launch of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, following Die Zeit-avis, which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship would have joined the fleet in 2014, but the worrying problems after its delivery lay the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships the Marine Defense Ordered Back in 2007, comes as a replacement for the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will contain a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the newest frigates for up to two years away from the ports at home.
Nevertheless, continuous delays mean that the groundbreaking warships, which apparently allowed Germany to exercise power abroad, will already be dated when they enter the service, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 friar made headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to accept the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the German fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
The reasons for the return were not known, but German media quoted a number of important ‘software and hardware failures’ that made the warship useless if they were placed on a combat mission.
Software faults were particularly important as ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the workers on older Bremen fries.
It also turned out that the ship is dramatically overweight, which reduces performance and limits the fleet's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7000-tonne 'Rheinland-Pfalz' is assumed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Except for the wrong hardware, the price of the entire project - including training for the crew - will also be a problem.
It is said to have reached floating €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from the initial €2.2 billion (EURO)
Problems associated with the newest frigates are particularly important in view of the recent warnings that Germany's fleeting power is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the fleet actually 'has almost the end of distribution-competent ships'.
The officer said that the problem has been built on over time, because old ships were decommissioned, but no replacement vessel was delivered.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates were able to join the fleet.
National Trust birds on secret life to bats
A new research carried out on a Scottish highland estate aims to reveal how the bats use the landscape in the hunt for food.
It is hoped that finding will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help to guide future conservation activities.
The study of researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano pipistrelles and besides brown langørea and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be located in important locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS additions and volunteers will also perform mobile searches using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the flag mouse calls and the species that do.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape scale image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a natural scientist for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal what habitat, natural worlds, which are most important for the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the purchase of meadows and how it is best to maintain a level playing field for bats and other related species.
Flag mouse populations in Scotland and over the United Kingdom have decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleep areas and habitat/site loss.
Wind turbines and lighting may also pose a risk, such as fly paper and some chemical treatments for building materials, as well as attacks on pet cats.
The bat is not really blind.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are still more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to detect defects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes the bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out investigations, the place of sleep inspections, and sometimes save lives.
The organisation has even created Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve on the Three Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Ownership manager David Thompson says that ownership is the ideal territory for them.
"Here on Threave we have a great area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many veterans and all the good habitats.
But it's a lot about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other owner domains will help us understand more about what they need to be happy about."
He underlines the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance in egg domains, since it is possible that the infinite destruction of a single boulder can kill up to 400 female bats and young people, and perhaps eradicating a whole local population.
Bats are saved and it is illegal to kill, plague or disrupt them or destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the audience to come in and help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we don't know how their populations are going."
Ronaldo rejects court debts in that lawyer sues German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has marked the legal debts against him as ‘false news’ and says that people ‘want to emphasize themselves’ by using his name.
His lawyers are meant to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published the claims.
Portugal and Juventus have been in debt to elect an American woman, called Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is claimed to have paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the event, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a live instagram video, Ronaldo, 33, says to his 142 million followers only hours after the debt, that the debt is ‘false news’.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news, says five times the Goldball winner into the camera.
‘They want to market themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They'll be familiar with saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything good, "let the player smile and smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are prepared to sue Der Spiegel over the claims, which they have called "an intolerable report on suspicions in the area of privacy", according to Reuters
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for «moral damage in an amount equal to the seriousness of the rule breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.»
The alleged event is said to have been found in June 2009 on a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga withdrew to the room of the player, where a claim that he should have picked her anal, following documents submitted at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on the knee after the assumed event and said he was "99 percent" a "good guy" and failed with "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographed her injuries at a hospital, but later agreed on a settlement because she felt "feared by retribution" and was concerned about "becoming public apathetic."
The 34-year-old says that she is now trying to change the dwelling as she continues to be traumatised by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to Italian giant Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'will forever undo' losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom “will undo it forever” if it loses its status as a world leader before car production after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark has said.
He added that it was ‘about’ that Toyota UK had told BBC that if the United Kingdom left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
'We need an appointment,' said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the effect of frontier delays in case a non-contracting Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced almost 150,000 cars last year, where 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
‘My opinion is that if the United Kingdom leaves the EU at the end of March, we see a production stop at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director at Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have been afraid to leave the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says, for example, that it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns about what car manufacturers say are the risks of supply chains in the event of a non-contracting Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is driven on a just-in-time basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the United Kingdom and the EU for cars ordered.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, disruptions can occur at the border that the industry says may lead to delays and a lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day's values of equipment at his Derbyshire factory, said the company, and thus the production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Checker's plan for future relations with the EU is "calibrated online to avoid border controls."
'We need an agreement; we want to have the best agreement that will allow, as I say, not only to benefit from the success today, but for us to seize this opportunity,' he told BBC Radio 4's daily program.
‘Provide from not only Toyota, but other producers are that we must be able to carry on with what has been a very successful set of supply chains.’
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term, they claimed that additional costs would reduce the competitive capacity of the plant and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years, and is the Unite Union Association at the plant, said that his members are more concerned by: "By my experience, when these jobs go, they never come back.
A spokesperson to the government said: ‘We have presented a precise and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU.’
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's high-ranking meeting with Vice-Chair Attorney Rod Rosenstein could be 'pressed back a week' as the fight against the Supreme Court nominees Brett Kavanaugh continued, said the White House Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of Special Councillor Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election interference, links between Trump helpers and Russia, and the potential prevention of the President's justice.
Corvitt Trump will put up the general of the attorneys' attorneys or not, thus endangering Mueller's self-standing, has fed Washington gossip for several months.
Earlier in the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed a lease to register calls with Trump and the ability to remove the president by means of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein refused the report.
But last Monday he went to the white house, and it was reported that he was about to quit.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then at the UN in New York City, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would ‘advare’ not kick Rosenstein, but then the meeting was exposed to avoid crashing with the Senate hearing how both Kavanaugh and one of the women who have charged him with sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh, which delayed the full vote of the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When she was asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "No date has been set. It may be this week, but I can see that it is delayed yet another week because of everything else that happens in Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would say that it is not the same: Sanders has not held a press orientation for the White House since 10 September.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked the queer.
Sanders said that the lack of information was not due to a dissatisfaction with the TV reporter's game for the gallery, even though she said, "I don't disagree that they do it."
He mentioned and that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
‘The President holds more press conferences than any president has done before,’ she said, quite correctly, without providing evidence of the claim. ‘We have looked at numbers.’
Sanders says that updates are still going to happen, but ‘if the press gets the chance to ask the President directly in the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
We've tried to do it this way, and you've seen us do it often in the last week, and it's going to take over instead of a press briefing if you can talk directly to the President of the United States."
Trump admits a lot of questions when he travels from the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
It's unusual for the president to hold a press conference alone.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, where he acted without shame on the reporters, and almost bizarrely.
Health Secretary writes about Brexit fears for EU workers at NHS in Scotland
The Secretary of Health has written to EU workers working at the NHS in Scotland to express their gratitude and wish that they continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter even if there are less than six months left before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to absorbing the costs of applications that have the status of EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In the letter Freeman wrote: ‘During the summer, negotiations on withdrawal between the United Kingdom and the EU have continued and are approaching the expected end of the autumn.
Nevertheless, the British government has stepped up preparations in case there is no agreement.
I understand that this must be a difficult time for you all.
So I'm going to repeat how much I've seen of the contributions to all of them, no matter what nationality they have.
Colleagues from the EU, and elsewhere, have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health care and are beneficial to patients and communities.
Scotland is perfectly clear, and we would like you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes acute surgery after head injury
The linebacker Christion Abercrombie, who plays at Tennessee State Tigers, went through an emergency operation after pulling an injury in his head when the team lost 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodore on Saturday, reports on The Tennessee.
The Tennessee State Main Trainer, Rod Reed, reported that the damage happened just before the break.
“He came to the sideline and collapsed, in one way,” said Reed.
Coach and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and took him back for further evaluation.
An official spokesperson from Tennessee State told WSMV that Abercrombie had completed surgery on the Vanderbilt medical centre.
There's no detail about the extent of the damage yet, said Harris, and added that Tennessee State was still trying to figure out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie goes second year at university, and is in his first season after being transferred from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles before he was injured in Saturday's fight, and is now up in 18 total this season.
Non-resident buyers must pay a higher document fee when they purchase property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers have to pay a higher document fee when they purchase property in the United Kingdom. The additional income is to be used to help the homeless, according to the new conservative plans.
Decision will neutralise Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The increase in the document fee will be added for those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
State Treasury expects an increase of up to 120 million pounds a year -- to help the homeless
Theresa May will today announce that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher document fee when they purchase property in the United Kingdom. The additional income will be used to help the homeless.
This decision will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn in attracting young voters who are thinking a lot, with the promise of offering decent dwellings.
The increase in the document fee will be added for individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the extra money will strengthen the government's desire to reduce the number of strippers.
The fee, which comes in addition to the current document fee, includes the higher levels that were introduced two years ago in the number two and rental locations, may be as much as three percent.
Statskaskasa expects a decision to collect up to 120 million pounds a year.
About 13 per cent of new buildings in London are purchased by residents outside the United Kingdom, making prices higher and entry into the housing market more difficult for first-time buyers.
Many well-being areas in the country - especially in the capital - have become ‘ ghost cities’ because of the large number of foreign buyers that most of the time has arisen in other countries.
This new policy only wakes up after Boris Johnson cut the document fee to help more young people buy their first home.
He appealed to a large construction company to keep prices up by getting ownership, but not using them, and asked Theresa May to give up quotas on reasonable properties to fix the UK's 'busy housing'.
Corbyn has announced a series of unparalleled proposals for housing reforms, including controlled rentals and the closure of non-ground displays.
He wants and gives more power to build new dwellings.
May said, "Last year I said that I wanted to dedicate my position to bringing back the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
That means fixing the damaged housing market.
The United Kingdom will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it may not be fair for individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, or foreign companies, to buy dwellings that are too hardworking, British residents.
For many people, the dream of their own dwelling has gone too far away, and the audrifying by being oversteppers is real.
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland'
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his ‘ultimate ambition’ is to be the manager of Scotland at some point.
The Scots (42) are looking over the challenge of revitalizing the club from the north-east.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, after having led St Mirren back to the Scottish elite series of the previous season.
‘I would play for my country playing.
I got a B-land battle, and it was," said Ross to Scotland's BBC Sports Sound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland at Hamden together with my father, and there has always been something that has dragged me back.
This possibility can only come if I have succeeded as a club manager."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland Manager include Dick Advocate, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he hasn't been anxious to come after so many established names in such a big club, since he has previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
'For the moment, success for me will be measured in whether I 'can get this club back in the Premier League.'
In view of the structure and facilities of this club, there is no doubt that they belong at home in the Premier League," he said.
'It's not easy to get them there, but I can probably only think of myself as successful if I can get the club back there.'
Ross is only three years into his career as a manager, after a period as assistant director of Dumbarton and a 15-month period in the coaching apparatus of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa to come from the teardown to the third level, and turned St Mirren, who was about to move down, into the title winners in the championship series of the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now, than he ever did while he was playing in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
‘It was probably a roadway barrier,’ he says, ‘to lead Alloa.
‘I honestly thought that being a manager would fit me a lot better than being a player.
It's a little bit right out, because I did it well, I felt good and I liked it relatively well.
But gambling can be tough.
There's a lot of things you're forced to come through every week.
I still notice when it comes to stress and pressure with the job, but it seems right to be a manager.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now I am. It's the most comfortable I've felt in my own body in my entire waking life."
Sunday 30 September, you can right the whole interview at Sportsound, Radio Scotland, between 12 and 13.
Testing shows that the perfect time for a half-litre is 5.30 p.m. on a Saturday
The heat wave of summer has led to an increase in the inflammability of stretching pubs in the United Kingdom, but also increased pressure on restaurant chains.
In July the sales increased by 2.7 percent in the bar industry - but for the restaurant industry it went down by 4.8 percent, the statistics show.
Business consultant Peter Martin, who is behind the statistics, said: "The current sun, and the fact that England was in the World Cup longer than planned, means that July followed the pattern of June when pubs went up 2.8 percent, only that restaurants became even harder frame.
The 1.8 percent decline in the restaurant industry was only worse in July.
Pubs and bars selling drinks made it significantly better and went up more than restaurants went down.
Pubs that sell food, got and noticed the fall in the sun, although it wasn't as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
It might seem that people just want to go out for a drink.
Among pubs and bars had the drinking room increased by 6.6 percent this month, while food had gone down three percent.
Paul Newman, a travel and leisure analyst at RSM, said: "These results are the continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Value, and the impact of a huge social or sporting event, will still be the greatest factors when it comes to the outdoors business.
There is no surprise that the restaurant industry will still wear out. A 4.8% annual drop in the hall will be painful to get at the top of a lukewarm cost pressure.
The long, warm summer could not come at a worse time for food-driven operators. Time will show if the more moderate temperatures that have been in August can give a prolonged breathing space.»
The total salinity across pubs and restaurants, including new ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the downstretching in the release of brand products.

One of five children has secret profiles on social media that they hide from parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - has secret profiles on social media that they hide from parents and teachers, shows an investigation
The study of 20,000 students on ongoing reveals an increase in ‘false Insta’ profiles
This news has increased the fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a 'head' profile they show parents
One in five children -- some as young as 11 -- makes profiles on social media that they keep secret from the adults.
A survey of 20,000 elephants on a continuous scale revealed a significant increase in false Insta profiles - a reference to the Instagram image sharing platform.
The news has increased the fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of the students say they have a sterile "head" profile they refer to parents, while they have private profiles.
A mother who stumbled over the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged others to ‘elect me’.
The research, made by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) on different scales, found that 40 percent of those between 11 and 18 years had two profiles, and half of them admitted to have private users.
The head of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: ‘It’s surprising that so many teenagers are tempted to create online places where parents and teachers can’t find them.’
Eilith Doyle becomes the voice of the athletes of the Scottish Freedom regime
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Scottish Liberation as non-administrative Director at the Annual General Meeting of the Management Board.
Doyle is the most decorated recreationalist in Scotland, and director Ian Beattie describes the event as a great opportunity for those who run the sport to take advantage of its extensive international experience during the last decade.
‘Eilidh has a lot of respect across Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world’s recreational communities, and we are sure that the law of peace in Scotland can benefit from getting it into the board,’ said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I am eager to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope I can contribute and help sports in Scotland."
The American, who has gold from both 200m and 400m in Atlanta in 1996 among its total four OL gold and now is a regular guest at the BBC, was unable to go after a drop.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today is a month since I had a fight.
I could not go.
The doctors said it was only time to tell me if I was going to be okay again, or to what extent.
It's been exhausting work, but I've been pretty good again, I've learned to go again, and today I do flexibility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!’
Split Internet meanings about breast pump clips that compare mothers to dairy cows
A breast-pump company has split the opinion on the Internet with an advertisement that compares breast-fed mothers to dairy cows.
To mark what is described as ‘the world’s first silent, tight breast pump’, the technology company Elvie released a small number of advertisements inspired by music videos to demonstrate the freedom of the new pump providing mothers who extracted milk.
Four real mothers dance in a high-fill bar with cows, to a song that includes text like: "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you don't see tails" and "If you don't notice it, this isn't the tension, it's my puppies."
"Pump it out, pump it out, I feed these children, pump it out, pump it out, I melt my ladies."
The advertisement, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has, on the other hand, created controversy online.
With 77 000 views and several hundred comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the viewers, and many say it highlights the 'scream' in the dairy industry.
‘Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to become pregnant and fed to produce milk, only that the calf is stolen from the days after birth,” writes one.
Elvie breast pump sits discreetly in a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: «Understood enough traumatic for both mother and child
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?’
Another added: 'For a remote advertisement.'
Others defended the advertisement, and a lady admitted that she seemed to sound ‘feasty’.
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would have had one if I still had an grandmother.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
This advertisement is a little crazy, but I took him for what he is.
This is a brilliant product, wrote one.
Another comment: ‘This is a funny advertisement directed at mothers who pump (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This is not a advertisement that boasts or condemns the dairy industry.»
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they have all danced with the disk space pump packed into their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump, they say, feel like cows.
Elvie's pump, on the other hand, is completely quiet, has no wires or pipes, and is discreetly inside an breast-feeding bra, which gives women the freedom to move, keep their kids, and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balardin, partner and creative director of Mother, commented: «Elvie pumpa is such a revolutionary product that it fastens a wave and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between mothers who extract milk and dairy cows, we want to place search lights on breast pumping and challenges attached to it, and at the same time demonstrate the incredible freedom of the new pump will bring, in an entertaining and recognizable way.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has made headlines.
During the fashion week in London, a mother showed up at two more on the stage for designer Marta Jakubowski, while she used the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children move quietly to camp on the Texas border
The number of prison immigrants has peaked even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly because strict Trump administration policy has introduced making it more difficult to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they fear that standing up and accepting a child may threaten their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk of the increase in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other grown family members will be forced to submit fingerprints and that these data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence testified from the Convention's Immigration and Customs Enforcement and said that the Agency has arrested dozens of people who have applied to be sponsors for single minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had nothing on its scroll from before.
"Almost 80 percent of those who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of these are criminal foreigners.
So we're going to continue pursuing these human beings," said Albion.
Following the additions to the camp, new rules have now been introduced to deal with the children. The rules require some of them to be in court before a month has passed, against 60 days.
Many people will participate via video calls and not at personal meetings, in order to get the case they tried to maintain an immigration sentence.
Those who are not qualified for freedom will be deported quickly.
Its longer children are in custody, the more likely it is that they develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to elective outbreaks or escapes, they say they are added to the camp. Reports that have appeared in recent months say the same thing.
Speakers say that these concerns are greater at large plants such as Tornillo. Due to the size of the plant, it is more likely that a person overlooks signs of child wear.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally, or saying hate to friends, can intensify the trauma that many people are already struggling with.
Syria asks US, French and Turkish occupying forces to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked for Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country is now at war in the eighth year.
Moualem, acting as Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, said that future forces are being illegal on Syrian soil, under the guise of fighting terrorism, and ‘will be dealt with from it’.
‘They have to withdraw immediately and without intention’, he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been removed from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue to “fight a holy battle until all Syrian territories have been cleansed” for both terrorist groups and “illegal presence of the stranger.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and counseling both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the warlord country.
When talking about the refugee problems, Moualem said it was safe for them to come back, and he blamed "some Western countries" for having spread irrational fear about the surroundings that caused the refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate the return," he said.
‘They are making policies out of something that should be a purely humanitarian problem.’
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no help in rebuilding Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is in place.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major insurrection, has made it possible to continue pushing forward with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement averts a great attack from Russian-stretched Syrian forces in the province where three million people live.
Moualem nevertheless underlined that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against jihadist, including warriors from the Nusra Front, who are associated with Al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated."
The UN's delegates, Staffan de Mistura, hope to soon gather the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to prepare a post-war law for Syria, and pave the way for the elections.
Moualem lays down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the work of the panel should be limited "to review the articles of the current institution", and warn against disturbances.
Why Trump is going to win a term for
With that logic, Trump will win the re-election in 2020 if not, as many liberals see it probably hope, the presidency will get an early end because of scandals and national law.
That would no doubt be the most dramatic end of a presidential life ever!
At the time of writing, there are no signs that the viewers have lost their jobs.
Since 2014, CNN has doubled its rating in the best transmission time to 1.05 million, while MSNBC almost has triple its to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the best transmission time, up from 1.7 million a year ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has games at the top of the cable rating with as much as 3.5 million viewers on evenings with great news.
"This is a fire that people are being lured by, because there's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer in the ABC drama "Designated Survivor," which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the congress building.
Nell Scovell, an old comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She thinks of a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he was going to vote on Trump.
She asked why.
'Because he made me laugh,' he replied, following the scovell.
There's an entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, history coming from Washington can decide the future to Roe v. Wade, whether the immigrant family gets together again and whole to the global economy.
Disabling is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself in the sixth hour to see a panel of experts debating Bob Woodward's use of sources with "deep background" for the book "Fear," Paul Manafort's bomber jacket of ostriches to $15,000 ("one garment thickened by arrogance," said Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniel's scary description of Trump's, eh, anatomy.
Personally, I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality program is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, daily manager at Wheelhouse Entertainment and creates by "Pawn Stars", about the show going on with Trump's employees and daily disputes (go into a fight with NFL, rose Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss a single episode, otherwise you won't hang up.
When I hit Fleiss this week, it was over 25 degrees and sun outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat in and looked at MSNBC while he took up CNN.
He couldn't get away, not when Brett Kavanaugh was facing the Senate Commission and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging in a thin thread.
"I think when we did all these crazy show before and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," said Fleiss.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money from outside flows into the densest intermediate election match
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th district sees an abundance of money, thank you for a conversion of Congress districts that led to two sitting members fighting for the same seat.
The recently converted sub-urban district of Pittsburg forwards Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district through a special election last spring.
Lamb is fighting against another sitting member, Republican Keith Rothfus, today a representative in the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, who is largely overlapping with the new 17th district.
The map was redrawn after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania in January determined that the old districts were illegally designed to benefit Republicans.
The 17th District Competition has launched a weapons campaign on the financing of the campaigns, between the major parties its money arsenal, the Democratic Congress Committee and the Republican Congress Committee.
Lamb was a known name in Pennsylvania after a button says in a closely followed special election in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat had listened to a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with over 20 points.
Political experts have given the democrats a scarce advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador due to support for China, but withdrew
Diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama already have recognized Beijing without negative reactions from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama to throw out the Trump organization's leadership group.
State Secretarys decided to bring back the U.S. leaders for diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "last decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the Department's spokesman, in an early announcement of this month.
However, punishment was only assessed against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and financial support.
The sanctions, which contained cuts in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and their high unemployment rates and murder rates.
As internal meetings developed, North American and Central American officials postponed a conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
However, in mid-September, the top administrators informed that they wanted the conference to continue, thus putting a stop to the assessment of the punishment for El Salvador.
It has now been said that Vice President Mike Pence is going to meet the conference, which has been planned in the middle of October, as a signal of the relevance of the administration to the collection, said the diplomats.
And the three U.S. broadcasts returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new tough messages or punishments from Washington.
A Bolton spokesperson would not comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who were some about discussing the internal considerations of anonymity.
Their description was confirmed by a non-comprehensive analyst who works closely with the administration and also spoke during the performance of anonymity.
Study history
A waits for special adviser Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacles to justice, which are now considerable evidence of in the public protocols.
According to the reports, Mueller should focus on whether Trump's campaign was conspiring with Russia's attacks on our choice.
If Congress were to change controllers, Trump would have to be prepared in this body, in which he prepares to overestimate the voters and possibly a jury of his equals.
There's a lot about it, and I don't mean to suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable either for his counterpart in Europe.
It's a choice to take all of us on both sides of the pond, which will affect how long the battle can be.
In 1938, the German officer was ready for a coup d'état against Hitler, only the West had opposed him and helped the Czechs in Munich.
We failed, and failed to miss out on the possibility of avoiding years of bloodshed.
The course of history revolves around such turning point, and democracy's unreserved march is accelerated or postponed.
Americans are facing several of these turning points now.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in deep water all because this newspaper revealed that last year he proposed to intercept the president in hiding, and wondered if he was unfit for his role.
Rosenstein says The Times' description is inaccurate.
‘How will we react if the recently requested FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or he is accepted by the Supreme Court despite threatening guilt for sexual assaults, and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the middle of the vote for a convention that keeps Trump responsible?
If we fail these tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we're wrong, because of what I learned in Praha.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country I have my embassy in.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me off the guard to light the sabbatical lights on the table asking the swastika.
When this is my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Rangers Graham Dorrans is optimistic before the meeting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers take on Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing to say about the Austrians, after an impressive decision in Spain towards Villarreal earlier this month, they will give a good starting point to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A knee-damaged obstacle midfielder Graham Dorrans in making his first performance this season before the 2-2 result against Villarreal, but he thinks Rangers can use this result as a springboard for bigger things.
'That was a good point for us, for Villarreal is a good team,' said the 31-year-old.
‘We went into the game with the confidence that we could get something, and came out again with a score.
Maybe we could take it towards the end, but everything at all is a draw probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and then we got out in the second half and were better off.
On Thursday, there will be a big European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but there will be a tough fight. They got a good result in their previous fight, but with the audience behind us I'm sure we can run on and get a positive result.
The last year has definitely been tough, with everything that has happened to my injuries and changes in the club, but now everything feels good.
The stable is good and the boys thrive; the training is good.
Hopefully we can run now, put the previous season behind us and be successful.»
Women lose sleep over this fear of pension savings
Despite the fact that participants in a study had clear thoughts about how they would be taken care of, few people talked to family members about it.
About half of those who participated in a study by the insurance company Nationwide said they talked to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of themselves, but they don't take the necessary steps to have that conversation," says Vice President of Nationwide, Holly Snyder.
Here you go.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you if you do not want to make your known good time in advance.
Cooperation with a consultant and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these options may be a major part of determining costs.
Get a financial advisor: your advisor may also help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
The long-term care financial options can include a traditional long-term care insurance, a cash-valued life insurance to help pay the costs, or to assure yourself with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Create legal documents: Disable legal struggles before starting.
Get a health authorisation in place, so that you designate a person you trust to supervise your medical treatment and to ensure that professionals act in line with your wishes in case you can't communicate.
You can also assess a power of attorney for your finances.
You should select a person you trust to make financial decisions and make sure that your bills are paid if you are not able to do so yourself.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your old parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write all these details into a written plan, so you're done.
'It's not just the finances it's about, but who's gone?' asked Martin.
‘What kind of medicine is that?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Prepare the plan.»

Indonesia earthquakes and tsunamis
At least 384 people are killed by a heavy earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, says public service staff. The number of days is expected to increase.
Without communication, no help workers have been given information from Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the quake, which had a strength of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster was a fact.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, lying on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island. The estimated population in 2017 was 379 800.

In 1938 more than 200 people were killed and several hundred houses destroyed by a tsunami in Donggala.
In 1996, the west side of Donggala was struck by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia lies in the seismic Ageing of the Pacific and becomes a smooth frame of earthquakes.
Here are some of the big quakes and tsunamis in the last few years:
2004: A large quake on the west coast of the Aceh Province in northern Sumatra on December 26, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.

The oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested and targeted for power in the world
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Governor of Alaska and Vice President Sarah Palin, has been arrested, aiming for assault.
Following a report released by the Alaska State Police, Palin (29) was arrested for suspicion of domestic violence, interference in the reporting of domestic violence, and opposition to arrest.
Following the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance as she tried to call the police to report the crime.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su prison, and is being held against bail $500, reported by KTUU.
He appeared in court Saturday and declared himself ‘not guilty’ when he was asked, gave up the network.
Palin is facing three class A perpetrators, which means he can be imprisoned for up to one year and get $20,000 in fines.
He has also been targeted for a Class B crime, which can be punished with a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
It's not the first time Palin has been charged with anything criminal.
In December 2017, he was charged with having attacked his father, Todd Palin.
Mora, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
Saga is in the Alaska Veterinary Court.

Federal actors will rarely have the death penalty for suspects in New York terrorism
New York federal actors will have the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the terrorist attack that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that hasn't been committed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov (30) shall have used a rental car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway on the lower Manhattan in October, where he ran down pedestrians and cyclists on the road.
In order to justify a death penalty, the actors must be able to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims ‘with will’ and that he ‘with will’ inflicted serious bodily harm on them, following a note filed in the southern district of New York.
Both of these events may result in a possible death penalty, see the legal document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury handed over a list of 22 charges, including eight targets of money extortion, commonly used by federal actors in connection with organized crime, and a screening for the choice and destruction of motor vehicle wear.
The attack claimed ‘substantial planning and counseling’, said the actors and described the way Saipov carried out the attack as ‘disgusting, cruel and corrupt’.
«Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov spring cause damage and loss for family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleveland, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco», the note states.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the last South District in New York has been judging the death penalty in one case.
The aim, Khalid Barnes, was judged to have killed two dope suppliers, but was finally sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage to the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
On June 19th, 1953, both were executed in the electric chair.
Saipov, the author of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of regret in the days and months that followed, in accordance with legal documents.
He told the detectives that what he had done most well, said the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack after watching videos from ISIS on the phone, the report says.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag in the hospital room, the police said.
He has declared not guilty at all charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, says that they are «clearly disappointed» with the decision of the prosecution authority.
‘We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty, rather than to accept a declaration of guilt for life in prison without possibility of discharge, will only prolong the trauma of the event for all involved,’ said Patton.
The defenders of Saipov had previously asked the actors not to go after the death penalty.
Member of Parliament in Tory my Nigel Farage should rent Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to ‘mobilise the public army’ today, during a protest at the Tory National Meeting.
The former leader of the British Independence Party said that politicians had to “feel the pressure” from the Eurosceptics – one of Theresa May’s MEPs suggested that he should rent the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative, merciless parliamentarian Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that the United Kingdom «had been out» no, if Farage was Brexit Minister.
With May’s challenge of reconciling its deeply divided rectangles, it has been underlined by a separate protest in the city, held by Tories who want to be in the EU.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep the Chequers compromise on track after attacks by Brexitians, Remainers and the EU.
Allierte insists that she will press for an agreement with Brussels, despite going back – and force the Eurosceptics and the Workers' Party to choose between its package and its 'chaos'.
Bone told the Leave Means Leaves group in Solihull that he wanted to "reject Chequers"
He proposed that Farage should give us a decent rank and be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had stumbled, we would be out now," he said.
The Member of the Parliament from Wellingborough added: 'I will fight for Brexit, but we must reject Chequers'.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the warlords give says about Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the team orders from Mercedes came to have a major role in the course.
Bottas got a good start on the race, and let Hamilton take care of himself in defending his position the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack the teammate.
Vettel was first into the depot and let Hamilton enter the traffic at the back of the loop, which should be decided.
The Mercedes ran into the depot a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton ported the front after some action side-by-side that meant that the Ferrari driver againstvilleg had to leave the inside free in order not to defend himself at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started, on his 21st birthday, in the back row and was in the seventh place at the end of the first round.
After that, he led large parts of the race as he went for a quick finish with the goal of running past Kimi Raikconen who was in fourth place.
He entered the depot in the 44th round, but he could not increase the speed of the last eight rounds while the Raikkonen got fourth place.
It's a difficult day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend, and was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team has done an exceptional job that has both first and second," said Hamilton.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Diane Feinstein at an election meeting on Saturday because she insisted that she did not read the letter from Christine Blasey Ford where she appeals to the Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh for sexual assault.
During a speech at an election meeting in West Virginia, the president had not mentioned the witness Ford had given directly to the Senate, but also commented that what goes on in the Senate showed that people were ‘bad and bad and talk untrue’.
"The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened the last days in the Senate, when you see minds, when you see people who are angry and bad and uncomfortable and talk untrue," he said.
'When you look at publications and leaks and say, 'Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you think?
Dianne Feinstein, did you paint it?
Do you think her answer... you painted the document--'Oh, eh, what?
Oh, no.
I did not paint it.’
Please wait a moment.
Lak me... no, me didn't paint it,” he added, while he imitated the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it was played earlier in September--but Feinstein refused to play to play from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's suitors, I didn't finish her story," said Feinstein to the committee, following The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, which she asked for."
But her necktie did not fall in good soil with the president, who commented on it at Saturday's election meeting: "I say to you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
While he persists in defending the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of foolish sexual behavior by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats use the charges for their own gain.
'They are determined to take back power in all ways they see necessary.
You see the wickedness, the coincidence, they don't care who hurts, who they have to run over to gain power and control," said the president following the Mediaite.

Pilots lose their lives to ensure that hundreds of aircraft escape earthquakes
A pilot in Indonesia will be hailed as a hero after he lost his life in what he continues to ensure that a multi-hundred-passenger aircraft came safely into the air.
More than 800 people have lost their lives and many are missing after a big earthquake hit Sulawesi's eye and triggered a tsunami Friday.
Strong aftershocks continue to disturb the area, and there are many prisoners in Palu City.
But despite the fact that his colleagues fled for life, Anthonius Gunawan Agung (21) refused to leave his post in the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu, although it swinged wild.
He remained to make sure that the plane that was on the runway, Batik Air Flight 6321, took off safely.
He then jumped down from the control tower as he thought it collapsed.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision may have scared hundreds of lives, reported ABC News Australia.
We send a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in a larger town.
Unfortunately, he went away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
‘This is heartrending,’ he added.
In the meantime, the authorities are afraid of a number of deaths will increase to thousands, while the country’s crisis relief agency states that access to the small towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
"The number of dead people increases while we find bodies trapped under buildings. Many of them can't reach us until," said the bureaucrat Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six meters have destroyed Palu, who is going to keep a mass grave on Sunday.
Emergency aid comes in with military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance comes with multiple bodies.
It's hard to find clean water.
Small shops have been robbed.»

This is already a tragedy, but it can become much worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, came to Palu on Sunday and said to the military In the country, "I'm asking everyone to work around the clock to do everything they can to help with the evacuation.
Are they ready?’ reported CNN.
Indonesia was killed earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, and 550 people died.
Air traffic control in Micronesia: Air Niugini is now reporting missing after lagoon flight control
The air carrier operating an aeroplane that operated in a lagoon in Micronesia, Pacific Ocean, reports that a man is missing, having previously stated that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the aeroplane before it sank.
Air Niugini said that from Saturday afternoon they do not know how the human passenger is.
The airline said they work with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to find the man.
The air carrier no longer provided details about the passenger, and the age and nationality of the passenger are unknown.
Local boat owners helped save other passengers and crews after the plane hit the water as it tried to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
The authorities stated on Friday that seven people have been sent to hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, and everyone was in stable condition.
It's still unknown what the spring crash is and what actually her.
Both the airline and the American Marine said the plane landed in the lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses believed that the plane flew past the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
'That was extremely good,' said Jaynes.
Jaynes added that he and other passengers were able to water through the water, which led them to life, to the final exits of the plane before it sank.
He said the flight crew had panic and screams, and he suffered a head injury that was not serious.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors in the vicinity, who work at improving a berth, also frightened passengers with a rubber boat that they used to carry passengers to land before the plane sank at about 30 meters.

Analysts create timeline overnight when women became burned alive
The Prosecution Power presented all the evidence on Saturday under the Anka case for a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice's analyst Paul Rowlett witnesses for hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He produced for the jury how he squeezed the tape from cell phones to find out what she was doing at night when Jessica Chambers (19) was killed by the accused, Quinton Tellis (29).
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said that he used location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was together with Chambers' evening she died, as opposed to what Tellis explained earlier.
When the location data showed Tellis his cell phone was with Chambers' cell phone while he said that he was with friend Michael Sanford, the police pulled out to talk to Sanford.
Sanford witnessed on Saturday and said he was out of town that day.
Then the prosecution asked Tellis if he told the truth when he said that he was in Sanford's car that night, said Sanford that he "slaughtered because my car was in Nashville."
Another objection was that Tellis said that he had known Chambers in about two weeks when she died.
But their cell phone bills showed that they only knew each other in a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers died, Tellis deleted messages, conversations, and Chambers' contact information from his mobile phone.
'He deleted her from her life,' said Hale.
The defence shall close the case on Sunday.
The judge said he was expecting the court case to go to the jury later the same day.

Another black person?!
New York Children's Watcher sues couples for the kick after 'racial' text message
A babysitter in New York is suing a couple to give her the kick based on discrimination after she got a false text message from her mother who complained that she was "only a black person."
The couple have refused to be racist, and compared the prosecution with ‘expression’.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, was dissatisfied when she saw that the babysitter she had added, Giselle Maurice, was black when she got to work for the first time in 2016.
«NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEY, ONLY A STARCH PERSON," wrote Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, he sent her to the nanny Maurice, twice.
After realizing her mistake, it misguided Plasco-Flaxman the babysitter Maurice fired, and said that the previous babysitter, who was African-American, had done a bad job, so now she wanted someone from the Philippines, according to The New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day's work before they sent her home in a Uber.
She wants $350 a day for six months for the job she should have had, even if it was without a contract, where she was going to have a job with the family.
‘I will show them that it’s not a good thing to do this,’ she said to The New York Post on Friday, adding, ‘I know it’s discrimination.’
The couple have denied that they are racists, and said that giving Maurice fired was the only thing they could do after having offended her, of whom they were afraid she was going to take revenge.
"My wife had sent something to her that she did not mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," said the husband Joel Plasco to the New York Post.
"But would you let someone you have offended take care of your children, even if you didn't mean to insult them?
Your newborn baby?
Think about it.’
Plasco compared the prosecution with ‘expressing’ and said that his wife was seven months pregnant and was in a ‘very difficult situation’.
«Are you really going to attack a person in such a situation?
It's not a nice thing to do," said the investor Plasco.
While things are going on, the public has been quick to judge the couple on social media, criticizing them for their conduct and logic.
The publishers behind Paddington books were afraid that people weren't like a talking bear, revealing a new letter.
The daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the first book was accepted, commented: "It's hard to imagine what it was like to read the book for the first time before it was published.
It is very fun to know now how successful Paddington was.»
Jankel said that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about the little teddy bear, would be optimistic even if the book had been rejected.
When it comes to Paddington, as she portrayed as "a very important member of the family," she added that her father was proud of the inside of his great success.
‘He was a rather quiet man, and he never braided,’ she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having kids that got something: you get proud of them, even though you're not really behind it.
I think he looked at Paddington's success that way.
Even though it was his creature and imagination, he always gave all praise to Paddington himself."
My daughter was going to die and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
When she landed the daughter was taken to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice in all haste, where doctors work in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad, that they didn't believe she was going to make it," said Ednan-Laperouse.
"So Nad called to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I'm so happy with you, dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be right there.
The medical doctors had given her so that her heart would continue pumping slowly out of her system.
She had already died and now the body was about to turn off.
I just put it there, knowing that this happened.
I couldn't yell or scream, because I was in a room surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep everything.»
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the loss of her daughter, had to board the plane together with other passengers who did not know what she had just gone through.
"No one knew anything," she said.
‘I sat with my head bent while my tears fell.’
It's hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I knew how much sympathy I had for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how happy he was."
Suffering women hang on the bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who lost their loved ones who took suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have sticky notes on a bridge in Wales to inspire and make people who are going to take suicide to change their mind and call the numbers on their notes.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he started to deal with depression and took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I know myself every day."
Davis, who is 45 years old and caged in Lydney, said her son was a talented cook with a smile that infected.
"Everybody knew him because of his smile.
They said that his smile brightened up all the rooms."
But before he died he ended up at work, for he was in a "real dark place."
In 2014, the 11-year-old brother of Tyler was the first to find Tyler after he had taken his own life.
Davis said, ‘I am still concerned that the lingerie brother may have been affected by Tyler’s death.’
Davis wrote the notes 'for people to know that there were other people out there who cared and that they could talk to, even though it's a friend.
Don’t sit there alone – you have to talk to someone.”
Humphreys, who has been friends of Davis for many years, lost her partner Mark after they had been together for 15 years and he had recently lost his mother's mind.
"He never told me he was tired or depressed or anything," she said.
«A few days before Christmas we noticed that he began to behave differently.
He was in the cellar emotionally on Christmas 1st, when the children opened their gifts, he did not see the entrances.”
She said that his death was very traumatic to the children, and they continued to work through the trauma: "There's a big void in our family now.
We're completely broken.
But we must all fight to live on."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread while the FBI starts the investigation
"I believed that if we actually got something similar to what he asked for – a limited research – we might get some loneliness," said Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid of the Committee "jointly" in the middle of a partisanar-backlock.
Why wouldn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
They hesitate because of the timing.
The averages in the United States are only five weeks away, November 6th, and if the Republicans don't do it well, this will make it difficult for them to choose Kavanaugh in the U.S. Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has called senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House of Bush and was introduced to his wife Ashley in that way, then has been the secretary of Bush.
What happens when the FBI presents its report?
They're going to voice in the Senate, 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear if Kavanaugh is able to gather at least 50 voices in the Senate, with 50 voices, Mike Pense, the vice president of the United States, can give him the last voice and confirm him in the Supreme Court.
Number of decouples in North Korea "decreasing" under Kim
The number of North Korean demisers to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, reports a South Korean legislator
Park Byeong-zeug referred to data from the South Korean Department of Pre-entity, and said that there were 1127 dehoppers last year – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park said that more stringent borders between North Korea and China and more expensive smuggling charges are the main reasons why the number has fallen.
Pyongyang hasn't spoken publicly.
Most of the North Korea couples get South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of the flights via China, which have the longest border with North Korea and are easier to cross than the strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean countries.
China regards demurships as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, and often sends them back with coercion.
The relations between North and South Korea – which are still technically at war – have improved in recent months.
This month, the leaders met with the two countries in Pyongyang to negotiate the disarmament of nuclear weapons.
These conversations come after the historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they were able to work for an atomic-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho owed the United States not to achieve anything since then.
"Without being able to trust the United States, we cannot trust that our country is safe, and in such a situation we cannot disarm our weapons first," said Ri in a speech in the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterically," saying he can't count in the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, nominee of the Supreme Court, "hysterical" and said he has too much temperament to serve in the U.S. Supreme Court.
Pelosi calls Kavanaugh "hysterically" in an interview during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
‘I know that if a woman had behaved that way, she would have been called ‘hysterical’, said Pelosi about the testimony to Kavanaugh in front of the Senate Court on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotional and refused all charges that he sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In the opening speech to Kavanaugh, he was very emotional and yelled at times with lumps in his throat as he told of his family and years in passing.
He criticized the democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him “a grand and a planned attack on his reputation,” organized by liberal politicians who were angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi added that she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he can't count on the Supreme Court, because it shows that he's prejudiced against Democrats.
"I believe the way he behaved he disqualified, and what he said about the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi objected when she was asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh to leave if he was elected to the Supreme Court, and if the Democrats reach majority in the House of Representatives.
"I can say this -- if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he can't pretend in the Supreme Court, nor in the court he thinks now," added Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is the judge of Washington D.C.'s Federal Appeal Court.
Pelosi also said that as a democrat she is concerned about potential judgments from Kavanaugh against the promise known as Obamacare and the case of Roe vs. Wade, because Kavanaugh is known to be a conservative judge.
In the hearings to confirm Kavanaugh, he did not answer questions about whether he was going to reverse certain decisions in the Supreme Court.
‘It’s not the right time for a hysterical, prejudiced person in the Supreme Court to expect us to say he’s great,’ said Pelosi.
And women must swing the sword
It's a fair, bitter criticism, after months and years of rage, and she doesn't get it out without crying.
"We cried when we're angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
'I don't think that's unusual, do you think?'
She continued, "I got a lot of help from a woman in a high company position, who said that she saw when she was angry, but developed a technique where she said to the person who made her so angry that she noticed, "You think maybe I'm sorry because I cried.
I'm angry."
And then she just keeps going.
I thought it was brilliant.
Tears serve as a way of getting your mind out, but there are many who misunderstand.
In one of my strongest memories from a previous job, where most of my colleagues were men, I was in a situation where I saw the senses, and a woman who was older than me took me in the neck – she was a cold leader for whom I had always been saved for life – and pulled me out at the same time.
'Never let them see you cry,' she said to me.
"They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sorry, and they won because they made you cry."
Patricia Schroeder, who at the time was a congresswoman, a Democratic from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987 Hart was taken into custody on a boat called Monkey Business, and withdrew from the campaign. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought that she could just as well stand still as president himself.
"I had not really thought through it well enough," she said to me while she laughed, 30 years later.
'There were already seven other candidates who made elections, and the last one they needed was another candidate.
Some refer to the situation as «Snap white and the seven dwarfs».
Since the campaign had already gone for a while, she had not collected enough money, so she promised that she would only be quiet if she could collect $2 million.
It was impossible.
She discovered that her supporters who gave $1,000 to men just gave her $250.
'Do they think I'm getting a discount?' she asked.
When she declared that she was not going to make choices anyway, she was so emotional and full of gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and aim at the smokers in place of the shared streets, and anger against gender discrimination, that she began crying during the speech.
"You should have thought I had a nervous breakdown," said Schroeder about how the press reacted when she was a branch.
"You should think Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I'm thinking, what are they going to write on my gravestone?

How the trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The opening salvane in the trade war between the United States and China was insidious, and while the battle continues, a rift between the two countries can be an advantage to Beijing in the long term, says experts.
U.S. president Donald Trump shot first shot this year in taxing important Chinese exports, including photovoltaic panel, steel and aluminium.
The battle escalated this week, with tariffs on articles worth over $200 billion, which in effect means that half of all goods from China to the United States are taxed.
The Beijing has taken home and put a tariff of between five and ten percent on American goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to answer the United States every time they shoot the guys off, and the second largest economy in the world is most likely not to go down with the first.
To get Washington to stop, China has to do what the United States wants, but bowing to the United States is too flouted for Xi Jinping, President of China.
Yet, experts say that if Beijing keeps its head up cold, the US press can have a positive effect on the Chinese economy in the long term, by reducing the degree of dependence between the two economies.
‘The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can make both economies go under is more dangerous than people have the dare to admit earlier,’ said Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses on Asia at the Center for American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' for the return of refugees, says the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says they are ready to accept refugees who will return voluntarily, and ask for help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed after more than seven years in war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that relations in the country are progressing.
‘Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thank you for the progress made in the fight against terrorism’ he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to regain normal areas.
All intentions are now in place to allow refugees to return voluntarily to the country they had to travel from the base of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that exceeded daily life and livelihood.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million acids have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
An additional six million people in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government would like to receive help to rebuild the ruined country.
But he stressed that they were not going to accept assistance or help with conditions from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe secures saying in Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018 when they defeated the American team with a final score of 16.5 versus 10.5 in Le Golf National, except for Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil, and they have not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took back the crowns of the Danish captain Thomas Bjørn, who scored the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, tossed most of the tournament. He hit the ball in the water from the tea at hole 16, par 3, and therefore gave the saying to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari did well in all his rounds and became one of four players who ever got 5-0-0 since the tournament started its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was turned off 5/4 by the player with the lowest ranking on the European team, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, with the world's highest ranking, was 2 and 1 after English Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who has participated in eight Ryder Cupar, became the most winning European with 25.5 points in his career.
'Of course I didn't cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
So thank you for Thomas choosing me and trusting me.
I am so, so happy to get the trophy back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European saying.
He passed the baton on to the compatriot John Ram, who beat the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in single games on Sunday.
"I know a tremendous pride in beating Tiger Woods, I am raised to look at him," said Rahm (23).
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France, and now has a 13-21-3 I Ryder Cup up through the career.
A strange statistic from one of the world's best players, who has won 14 big titles and is only turned off by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled to find the fairway all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who impressed with high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Jim Fury, the American captain, spoke out after a disappointing show from his team. "I'm proud of these guys, they fight.
It was periods this morning that we made it hot for Europe.
I'm out of here.
The hat off for Thomas.
He's a remarkable captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the PGA in America and our Ryder Cup Committee and get on with it.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
One must take off his hat.
We were played round."
