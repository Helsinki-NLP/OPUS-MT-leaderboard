Barack Obama receives the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth US President
US President Barack Obama comes to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize here as the fourth US President in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma and the medal and a cheque of over 1.4 million dollars for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The head of the White House arrives tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the North-West metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First, he visits the Nobel Institute where he meets for the first time with the five committee members who elected him in October from 172 people and 33 organisations.
The Presidential couple then planned a meeting with the Norwegian King Harald V. and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reached its climax with the ceremony, during which Obama takes the prestige prize.
He receives this as the fourth US President, but only as the third to receive the prize directly in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will talk about the war in Afghanistan when the price is taken over.
The President does not wish to deviate from this issue because he knows that he is taking over the prize as a President who is currently at war in two countries.
A few days ago, he stepped up the efforts of war by sending further troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forget to highlight.
At the ceremony Obama also received the gol medal, the diploma and the check over ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to donate the money for charitable purposes, but he has not yet decided on a specific karitative work.
The event program then provides a banquet with the president and his wife, where, apart from Norway's king and queen, the Prime Minister and another 250 invited guests will be present.
Obama was very reluctant from the beginning to the price.
He said, for example, that he has the feeling that he doesn't quite deserve the prize.
He also repeated several times that it is not just for him, but for everyone who strives for the same values as he does.
Immediately after the announcement, he stated that this was "call for action".
Protectors of nature are accused of extortion
The Leitmeritz Police accused the head of the citizens' association "Naturschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" of extortion.
In several cases he filed appeals against some construction procedures last year, for the withdrawal of his appeals he demanded money from the investors to his favor, said Leitmeritz police spokesperson Alena Romova.
The Chairman of the Leitmeritz-Naturschutzgemeinschaftist Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in prison and he's threatened with a prison sentence of up to three years.
The sortier trash container in Brno do not smell good
In Prague people can sort the beverage packaging, in the South Moravian villages you can find again on foot and step up the sorting waste container.
And in Brno?
There you would have to reserve a few minutes to find the appropriate garbage barrels.
I don't want to claim that the waste separation in Brno would not work at all.
But it seems to me that even if we are the second-largest city in the Republic, the councillors are insufficient to deal with this problem.
Brno is in the waste race in the Old Forest League, not only because we as citizens are always allowed to dispose of only paper, glass and plastics in the sorting container, but above all because of the number of garbage barrels for such waste.
Have you ever tried to dispose of the PET bottles in a velvety basket, for example?
This is art, it takes time and strong nerves from everyone.
The only place I've found by chance so far is the mooring of the affected geese.
Mr Unterka should not make us angry with his colleagues, but this is far too little for me.
Apart from the fact that the waste separation is also not honey sludge in other parts of the world.
A whole series of my friends don't sort the waste at all.
Out of frailty.
It's too far from the garbage cans.
I'm not surprised.
I even offered after the celebration to dispose of a few glass and plastic bottles.
But on the Konicova Street, I didn't see any tins in sight.
Luckily, I got to the right place while driving the tram.
But the garbage almost ran over.
This is still the center of Brno, which represents the whole city, isn't it?!
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics probably make the Brno socialists cold.
They prefer to buy the city an ice hockey league that shames us all over the Republic, instead of buying a few more garbage cans and offering the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my assumption with official statistics after looking for a while on the Internet.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the whole district of South Moravia.
The Paroubek budget has deducted the money for pensions and sickness benefits
After the left party gave more money to farmers and officials despite the government's view, there is no more money in the budget for pensions, sick pay and construction savings.
But neither for public interest rates nor for international court disputes.
This causes even more problems to those who will be in government in the second half of next year, says the Finance Minister, Eduard Janota.
When the social democrats and communists perpetuated the salary increase for some groups, they reckoned that the government is paying the money for the delicate expenses, old age pensions or for the sick pay. "This is just a postponement of the problems in the future, laying mines," says Janota.
Of the loans, there are always higher interest rates, and you have to pay back the money sometime.
Too much to choose from, where to take, the state fund is empty.
If social benefits or costs are not reduced for the state holding, the tax must be increased.
For all those to whom the left party now gave more money: the fire brigade, the teachers, the farmers.
And later for their children as well.
People don't have to be afraid that they'll get this money.
But at the price that the state owes itself even more - in the next year the state fund will lack not only 163 billion, but much more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, debt will grow faster and faster and, together with it, the costs and interest rates.
The state will need the money for compensation, then it will no longer be sufficient to increase VAT only slightly or to reduce maternity benefit, as the government made in its region fictitious package.
Due to the turnout in favour of some electoral groups, five billion will be missing for the expansion of motorways and railways next year.
It is mainly the sections obtained in the competition that can no longer be re-projected and, if necessary, credited.
Get the most, which is also not free.
This means a delay or cancellation of thirty major buildings, and it is also a threat to Europe's wealth, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has suggested that it solves the drain of money in a Salomonic manner - it attacks the CEZ topicalists, in which the state is the owner of the majority, and from which the money is then distributed into the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of dividend is never safe and it is by no means an infinite source.
Last year, CEZ spent 18 billion on the budget.
Every year, the dividends pay the environmental damage liquidations, the pension account is filled up and this money is also used as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
With this trick, the actual budget deficit rises to the level of 5.7 percent of GDP, according to EU rules.
However, the carnival of the upheavals does not yet end.
The budget for various damages for victims of communism and crimes or for expenses for court disputes, even for building savings, fell nearly three billion.
Whether the state can do without this money is not sure.
It's just gambling.
If we lose an international court case, we have to pay for it anyway, Janota makes it clear.
The Minister must then save the money internally or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
One hundred million are also missing for the already started two-billion-billion-dollar project "State Fund", which should allow to monitor on-line, for which the individual authorities spend the money.
The first stage starts in January.
If the Finance Minister did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case sanctions would come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
The Americans expect for the future with a mobile phone on which the user can switch by pressing a single key between different operating systems.
The plans presented are promising.
It is enough to press just one key, and from Windows Mobile will be changing Android in a few seconds.
This is precisely the possibility that the American company intends to introduce VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtual software for computers.
We allow you to run two user profiles simultaneously on the mobile phone.
You can switch between these, you can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, Srinivas Krishnamurti from VMware announced during an interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented last November and presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
The virtualization of the smart phones is not fiction.
VMware already successfully presented the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM memory of 128 MB, on which simultaneously the mentioned systems run Windows Mobile and Android.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
The VMware company is now working with the European and American operators on the smartphone virtualization and to the customer the devices are due to come within 2012.
Snow shortage on the mountains torments the hotel owners
Scneeless slopes worry not only the giant mountain inhabitants.
The missing snow also scares people from ordering ski stays in hotels and pensions.
That's why you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year's Eve in Giant Mountains.
Our pages are often visited.
People go through the offers, set the prices, but meanwhile they are afraid to order legally.
And when they call us, they immediately ask whether our opinion is that this year's Christmas will be on snow or "on mash", the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, led.
Those who want the New Year's stay in the spindle mill exactly according to their ideas should no longer hesitate with the order.
Those who prefer to save and where the quality of the stay comes second can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now offer mostly weekly stays for the New Year's day.
I think they'll be trying to sell these for a while, but then they'll have to give in, too, and get in at shorter times.
And then the free rooms will disappear quickly, estimated Jandura.
The Ingtours Travel Office in Vrchlabi always offers free beds at all winter dates.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
In our offer about half of the places are still free.
Therefore, we have already prepared some more affordable Christmas stays for the last moment, led the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The New Year's Day in Giant Mountains can also offer the Vrchlabi travel agency, but there are less free places here.
Good sales are also found for the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year's interest in winter stays is also negatively influenced by the fact that there is always no snow in Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for snow to fall.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowed within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
Reverse and slightly better than last year, it is possible to occupy the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are about five percent better than in the previous year.
On New Year's Day and Christmas we only have a few free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
The Hotel Omnia is also occupied at the central parking lot in Janske Lazne for 80 percent of the New Year's stays.
On the other hand, half of the beds remain free at Christmas in the latest hotel in Janske Lazne.
We were pleasantly surprised this year of January, for which we are already occupied by about 60 percent.
A little weaker is in the meantime in February, but the moment the snow comes, the interest in the stays in the Giant Mountains certainly increases, led the director of the Omnia Hotel, Erik Sporysch.
The hotel owners of the Giant Mountains are now waiting for a larger snow shower.
On Thursday it should cool down and if precipitation occurs, it should be snow on the mountains.
But after that, Jiri Jakubsky informed about a warming up from the location of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repeating is the Mother of Wisdom
It is almost comical, with what disciple-strike Barack Obama, the president with his reputation of being the smartest, repeats the strategy of his predecessor in the Afghanistan question, which he himself held to be the dummiest.
When he finally sweated out his long-awaited Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he had written them off about the copy paper from the Busch-Irak scenario three years ago.
Not only that he himself uses the language "as in Iraq" several times, he has even used the name of the Bush declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New way forward", without frenzied.
Three years ago, he himself sent out the Bush idea - fresh troops quotas in Iraq plagued by the civil war - as "unresponsible and in its subsequent Karastrophic decision".
However, the following months showed that the only possible and successful Bush strategy, which was based on military recommendations, was that today the news about Iraq was no longer spoken at all.
The Bush call was not improved by this, because objectively he left his successor a much more grateful starting point than it was to be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will repeat itself.
In order to increase the military quota, the military again asked him, especially the commander of the Afghanistan operation General Stanley McCristal, who even despite subordination habits severely criticized the seditious shooters in the White House.
He demanded 40,000 soldiers to be able to reverse the situation for the better.
The President hesitated for three months, but did not come up with a better idea, and so he betrayed the general by 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe he pressed the promise for another 5,000, even if he himself originally calculated at least 10,000.
The most problematic thing about the entire Obama strategy is his plan to withdraw the troops from Afghanistan in 18 months, and to complete this process within three years. The entire Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the half increase will have the same effect as the action in Iraq.
Even in spite of the recent fraternal war, the Iraqi society is relatively well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is influenced by the contraindication - no one can be relied on and no agreements are made.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces who are accustomed to change their opinions every day.
The political institutions, even if they were formally properly founded, remain only sham buildings, behind which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
The balance of interests between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the intransigence of the conditions that further complicate Pakistan and Iran.
The establishment of a "actable state", which is the minimalistic goal of the entire operation, is also very unrealistic.
Obama Strategy Time horizon alienated by its voluntarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened further and is now on the verge of the explosion.
That is why they believe that the little soldiers who have broken into the war cry about the "early return" can create a miracle here, but only a truly romantic soul that cannot be impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, the date set for the withdrawal of the troops is simply irresponsible, because the Taliban will accept that as the indirect confession of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in the fights in Afghanistan has declined.
Europe's politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters the way in which Germany's or Italy's security is linked to the war in the Hindu Mountains' hinterland.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
Should the situation continue to deteriorate and the increased sanctions not affect Iranians, a very difficult question arises for the United States as to whether the problem is not to be solved by troops.
This question needs to be answered during the period in which America steps to Obama to withdraw from Afghanistan.
But every solution will also mean a dramatic change in the Afghan situation.
The only consolation patch for Barack Obama is the fact that three more years remain until the presidential election, and so there is still enough time left for him to take a different strategy, which would prove to be a total failure.
Bank Goldman Sachs managers no longer receive premium bonuses in cash
The senior executives of the American bank Goldman Sachs will not receive any premium bonuses in cash this year.
This has been announced by the company, which responds to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receives instead of the money stock, but it is only allowed to sell in five years.
In addition, the shares can be removed from managers in the case if they are excessively risky.
According to the Reuters Agency, Goldman Sachs is thus at the forefront of efforts to link the Wall Street premium bonuses with long-term performance.
I believe that Wall Street is aware of the further direction in which it has to go, led the former banker of JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs made herself the target of criticism, after she had put aside nearly $17 billion for premium bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
According to the Reuters Agency, the total level of premium bonuses in the course of this year is likely to exceed 20 billion dollars in spite of the measure announced today.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue in a number of countries at the beginning of the financial crisis.
The UK reported on Wednesday that it intends to charge the banker's bonuses, which exceed 25,000 pounds, once with a tax of 50 percent.
Similar steps are also being taken by France.
This year women won the Nobel Prizes in all disciplines, except in physics.
Five record women today in Stockholm from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI. Gustaf has taken over this year's Nobel Prizes in the professional categories and literature.
In addition to the four female scientists, the German writer was Romanian descent, Herta Müller, among them.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine has received two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the chromosome field.
Together with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, the prize for chemistry has been awarded by the Israeli Ada Jonah for information of the Ribosom structure and function.
The last Laureatin awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics, which American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson received for analyses of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, the scientists Charles Kao have taken this award for research in the fiber optics sector and George Smith, together with Willard Boyl, for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines or astronomical telescopes.
Each of these winners received the diploma, the Nobel medals and a certificate of acquisition of the price of money.
It amounts to ten million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several prizewinners in each category, the money price will be split among them.
Traditionally, the American president, Barak Obama, received the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize this afternoon in Oslo.
In his speech he acknowledged the controversies of his appointment because he is only at the beginning of his path, and is also at the top of the country that leads two wars - in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policy, however, he added that in certain situations wars are necessary for the battle of world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota considers the resignation. Klaus invited him to the castle
On Friday, President Vaclav Klaus receives the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, who is contemplating his stay in the government, because he does not agree to the implementation of the government budget for the next year in the form that was released by the Assembly of Members on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps the remaining Janota in the Cabinet will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which also further deepens the crisis of public finances.
The President-in-Office, Radim Okhvat, informed about the meeting.
About his further stay in function Janota wants to negotiate with the Premier Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the Budget Act, which will now be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should manage with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, however, Parliament voted on the proposals of the Left Party on the conversion of funds and increased the money for public officials' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and direct wages for farmers.
The government has opposed the social-democratic proposals that it conceals the increase in the budget deficit.
The Left Party on the one hand and the Government, Klaus and the Right Party, on the other hand, has therefore developed a sharp domestic political dispute, which is why the question mark arises about the further work of the Fisherman's Office cabinet, on which the ODS, CSD and Green Party have agreed in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as adopted by Parliament, practically liquidates the package of austerity measures implemented by the fishermen's government in autumn, and that, in their understanding, the debt of the state is to end.
Klaus, who is able to sign the law on the state budget but does not have to, said today at the discussion breakfast with entrepreneurs that politicians have neglected the "serious problem", which is "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances for a long time.
In his opinion, there is no good solution today.
An improvement could only bring about a strong government that could build on a broader consensus of the political parties.
The ODS president, Mirek Topolanek, pointed out that the budget is cruel, and the government should consider its further existence.
The ODS Chairman, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the cabinet with the support of the CSDD, ODS and Green Party is obviously no longer working.
Premier Fischer described similar words in the editorial team as "strong excuses".
The CSSD Chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek word that the budget deficit was horrific that the former Topolanek government had prepared for this year, and it exceeded 200 billion crowns.
As early as Wednesday, the CSDD rated the approval of the state budget for the next year as success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new movie by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unbeaten" of the world shows much about the country, from whose struggle and victory despite some criticisms that the main role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells of sports, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is represented in his life by the American Oscar actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by the one and ninety-one-year-old Mandela whether he could represent him in the Eastwood movie.
Another significant role is taken over by Matt Damon.
I told him, "If I'm gonna play you, I need to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who had received the prize for his role in the Eastwood drama from the boxing area "Million Dollar Baby", was already the leader of the movement for abolishing slavery, from which at the end has become the slave holder, a fictitious U.S. president, and also God in "Evan Almighty", but only rarely anyone who is still alive and important to many people as Mandela is.
The former South African statesman was in prison for 27 years for his active activity at the end of apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeated", and at the same time it is the name of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how to speak.
The film depicts a true event in which Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African Rugbyteam, Francois Pienaar, to reach agreement on the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people still remain racially and economically divided according to Apartheid.
He believes that he can agree his people through the sport, so he decides to some of the rugby players who belong to the outsiders around the world.
Finally, the South African team rises until the World Cup of 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela story to the cinematic wall.
He had no other goal than to play this role in order to approach it as closely as possible to reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge was, of course, to speak as he did.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela, eat dinner with him and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was shaking Mandela's hand.
I've determined if I shake your hand, I'll take over your energy, it'll be transferred, and I had the feeling that I know what you're feeling, he said.
For me, it's important to have become another person.
Matt Damon portrays in the film François Pienaar, Captain of the National Rugbyteam, in which the white players have considered.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard rugby world.
It was a great surprise for him when he met Pienaar in his house for the first time.
I remember when I called the doorbell that he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was: 'I look much bigger in the movie'.
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors compared to their actual role models, he has received "Invictus: Unbeaten" positive reviews under the direction of director Eastwood and one also speaks of prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety magazine, Todd McCarthy, summarized his analysis in the following words: "That was a very good story, a very well-run film."
In the movie reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Light Secret over Norway: The Russians tested a rocket
Over Norway there was a special light effect of unknown origin to be observed.
The Russian Ministry of Defence only admitted yesterday that near the Norwegian border, an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested.
The launch, however, was not successful again, and the rocket called the type "Bulava", which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of Russian generality as well as the Premier, Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence on site during the rocket test had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava has usually not been started or damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers, it is already written about "Bulava" as about a "racete that does not fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly but shines
This already 13th attempt, fell normal at the beginning.
Technical damage to the rocket occurred only at the end of the flight.
The engine probably exploded at the third rocket level.
This time "Bulava" started out of the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij, which was under the water of the White Sea.
This rocket type allows the U-boat to be fired.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an indefinite flying object over the north road was actually the damaged "Bulava".
In addition, since the first moment the Norwegians have not doubted that it is a Russian missile.
The generality has protected itself this time and claims that one cannot clearly speak of failure.
The first two stages of the rocket failed and the accident only affected the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Even if there was no trial start without errors, the leadership of the Ministry of Defence considers only six out of thirteen unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success therefore meets the generality with optimism and thus continues to claim that the "Bulava" will once fly without problems and even carry up to ten hypersound atom bomb heads with a total weight of max. 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov has signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at 51 years of age
The legendary defense player Vjaceslav Fetisov presents himself in a professional ice hockey game at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup owner is helping his team CSKA Moscow out in need, and is likely already in the Friday dulk KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who completed his career at the age of 40 in 1998, is currently president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas got hurt, we urgently need another defense player.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed that he will support the team.
We just need to clarify some other formalities, the agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow Club of Sergei Nemcinov.
In the meantime, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will only affect one game.
I mean that Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morals of other players, led fellow players Nemcinov.
When Fetisov returns to the ice surface, he becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey game after AP.
In the NHL, the legendary stormy Gordie Howe played a full season for Hartford with fifty-one years and was able to credit himself with 15 hits and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the Soviet Union's dress, he won two Olympic gold medals, seven world champions, and he also triumphed in Canada Cup and the Junior World Cup.
In the second part of his career he also gained successes in the NHL, where he raised the Stanley Cup twice over his head in the Detroit Dress.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Ice Hockey Star Room.
Hyundai gave up the unions. All overtimes are cancelled.
The management of the Nosovice Automobilfabrik Hyundai agreed with the union to cancel all over hours.
Because of frequent overtime, the trade union announced on Monday the readiness to strike.
This was confirmed by the spokesman of the Hyundai Automobile Company, Petr Vanek.
However, the management wants to reach agreement with the trade unions on a Saturday shift this week.
We must not give up our production plan, which is a principle, therefore on Saturday, December 19, voluntary overtime was proposed for the reason that two working shifts would be worked, said Vanek.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees who would work on the Saturday shift.
The employees will also receive this in retrospect for the Saturday shift of November 28.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the motivation of the employees for the proposed overtime.
They can either pay the overtime supplement or they can take substitute leave on December 28 and thus extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek showed up.
In addition, all Saturday shift employees are paid the fare and lunch.
With due regard to the fact that the overtimes were the most urgent and burning issue with regard to the demands and complaints of the trade unionists who had ceased production last week, the executive board decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk opened up.
By last week, the automobile factory employees had been forced to work almost every day after the eight-hour shift 2 more hours.
Once the agreement has been signed, trade unions will withdraw their willingness to strike.
Further negotiations between the management of the automobile factory and the trade unions are due to take place on Friday afternoon.
The trade union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree to meet the demands and sign a joint document, they would be willing to lift the strike.
The situation in the automobile factory has peaked last week, on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously struck for constant overtime.
They also protested against the bad payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The management argued, however, that employees must make the overtime to meet the automotive delivery needs.
The trade unions also called for no sanctions to be imposed on employees who had interrupted production on the previous Wednesday in their Monday strike call.
In the field of overtime, the unions are calling for a minimum reduction in overtime work.
In addition, they demand payment of 5000 crowns this year.
The Nosovice Automobile Company Hyundai now employs 2,000 people.
Serial production was started in the company last November.
By this September, around 80,000 vehicles were manufactured here, the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works in ́steeled ́ HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works with the viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact outweighs the disadvantage that the combination does not work as strongly in normal viral variants as one of the already existing medicines.
AIDS cannot be cured yet.
The patient can, however, prolong the drug compilation and prevent the proliferation of HIV viruses in the body.
However, your intake is accompanied by a whole range of side effects.
In addition, incomplete suppression of viral reproduction has resulted in the development of so-called resistant viruses that are no longer effective.
The work of the experts of three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, of the VSCHT (Chemical-Technological University) Prague and of the University of Heidelberg opens the way for dealing with virus resistance.
They have demonstrated that the substances called metalocarborane act on the protein that is responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metalokarboranes are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block viral proliferation in ways other than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists come to new 'improved' compounds, which were prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus protein.
The metal-ocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-purpose cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Domestic and persistent virus
HIV protease is an HIV protein that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus division caused by the HIV protease, no mature infectious virus particles would occur.
When we switch off the HIV protease, we also eliminate the proliferation of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists in the press report, published by the Institute for Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work published in the Scientific Journal of Medical Chemistry, the scientists describe whole series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which is then systematically changed further.
A little weaker, but more reliable
The impact of this series of substances against the HIV protease levels tested in the test tube, also against their persistent (resistant) variants obtained from HIV infected patients.
The effect of metalocarbane on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as that of the clinically used medicinal products, but it does not lose its effect on the resistant variants, which are often ineffective for the used medicinal products.
The unique mechanism of action as well as its additional properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical designs, makes the metalocarbanes interesting compounds for further research aimed at the development of effective anti-HIV drugs, says Pavlina Rezacova, Head of the Laboratory for Structural Biology of the Institutes of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Fighting for budget. ODS started on fishermen who resisted
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, called the approved budget "grayful" for the next year and the government of Prime Minister of Jan Fischer should consider his further existence.
The statement by the ODS called the Prime Minister "strong statements".
It's supposed to be time for the analysis.
Petr Necas, Vice-Chairman of ODS, said that the concept of the cabinet with the support of the CSDD, ODS and Green Party is obviously no longer working.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament when it comes to fighting the rising deficit, or whether he is going to remain in office with the help of parliamentarians.
The approach of the ODS and the social democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, according to which Necas pointed out.
On Wednesday, Parliament adopted the 2010 budget, but with Linkpartisan amendments over over 12 billion crowns.
Parliament has increased the money for officials' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
In doing so, the government has opposed the social democracy proposals that it conceals the increase in the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should operate with a minimum of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS has left the Chamber before the vote, so it has responded to the government's wish, because the amended budget is only a less poor version of the budget provisorium.
Disillusionment and Insanity
The finance minister, Eduard Janota, spoke about his disappointment and a sense of senselessness, whereas Prime Minister Jan Fischer pointed out that the government is still assessing the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened to withdraw in case the amendments were adopted, the situation would look different.
According to Czech television, Janota has signed up to the Prime Minister for Monday after the government business.
In doing so, he indicated that he was considering his further stay in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment over the budget's mismanagement.
According to Necas, the Social Democracy (CSSD) nominees who had implemented the changes in the budget have nothing to do with the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-enhancing laws, such as those relating to sickness benefits and pensions or the amendment of the Service Act.
Topolanek: The ministers nominated by ODS did not err
This is the case of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS made no mistakes, highlighted Topolanek in a US text message.
It has been mentioned that in some ministries there are people in deputy function who confess to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if fishermen decide to refrain from the fight against the deficit-height of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that it is based on the Left majority, which is currently in Parliament".
Then he allegedly cannot expect the support and tolerance of the citizens' democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if that is going to be the case, then I will deal with it, Mr Bartak, the Minister for Defence, nominated by the citizens' democrats, told the journalists in Parliament.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels at the European Council in the afternoon.
The ODS withdrew at the request of the Prime Minister
At the same time, Mr Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote in Parliament on Wednesday against the amended budget if the Prime Minister specifically asked Members of the citizens' democrats to allow the budget to be adopted.
We are not as orphans, we are not small children, so he then answered the question whether the ODS was not pushed back in the political debate on the budget by the absence of the chairman of the party in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn't realize my voice would be missing.
Even when I refrained from the mandate, I knew that in the next few months, especially with regard to the Bolshevikization of Parliament and destruction, everything would be positive, Topolanek himself responded.
According to the new schedule of the CD (Czech Railway) less trains will drive for approximately the same fare.
The Czech Railway terminates or restricts from 13 December some of the less used high-speed and local trains, while other connections are reinforced.
The total traffic volume will be reduced by two percent from the validity date of the new roadmap compared to today.
Most tariffs including base and customer fare are not changed.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava area receive several connections to the capital, and the railway uses trains of the type Pendolino for this route.
The express train will no longer travel to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less fast trains will also travel on the route Prague - Pisek - Budweis, in principle the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad will be reduced.
The largest reduction is planned in the Hradec Kralove district, which has a total of eight percent, while Prague and the surrounding area are looking forward to an increase.
Two night trains are also lifted on the route Prague - Tabor - Budweis and on a few days a week the operation of some fast trains on the route Prague - Pisek - Budweis will be reduced.
Among the biggest changes are the introduction of the new direct route from Milovice to Prague, currently the inhabitants of Milovice in Lysa nad Labem have to change.
It is the fifteenth route of the Esko suburban transport system, whose opening is possible thanks to the railway electricification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long-distance routes to the capital will end in the target station Prague - main train station.
The CD introduces more connecting lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will travel within two hours.
With the Pendolino, passengers have been unable to travel to Bratislava since 13 December.
This year's regional rail bill: an increase of 200 million
The fast trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, overall the railways will receive four billion crowns to compensate for the so-called loss of liquidity in the next year, exactly as this year. Local trains provide the districts, overall they will pay eight billion crowns for it next year, with the state shooting three billion.
This year, the regional rates of 200 million Czech crowns are more expensive.
For the local trains as well as the high-speed trains, the railway has re-established a ten-year contract, until now the contract has always been concluded only for one year.
The rail system praises the system, perhaps because of this it has not taken advantage of the large majority of tickets to increase the price.
Changes will only be made to CD Net once-daily tickets and to eLiska on cheap Internet tickets.
For passengers without the customer card, the price CD Net is increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The eLiska price will then depend on the driven connector, until now it was uniform for the journey between any district towns and cost 160 crowns.
Philippine militants arrest more than 50 people, the children were released.
Today, Millitante kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some basic students and their teachers.
This led the agency AFP, who originally informed only about 65 prisoners.
All 17 children arrested were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
He was abducted in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 millitante allegedly used the hostages as a living shield when fleeing the police.
The local negotiators are now working on the release of the remaining hostages.
According to the Agency AFP, the Millitants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), this is the arms fraction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police persecuted the kidnappers for the violence that demanded revenge between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindaao, due to the recent massacres in which 57 people were killed, the right of residence was suspended.
Among the victims of the massacre of 23 November, which was associated with the election to the governor's office, were 30 journalists.
Because of the suspicion of participation in the massacre, the governor of this South Philippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, Patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on Mindanao Island.
But on Tuesday the peace negotiations with the Philippine Government have resumed.
The story of South Africa concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods comes to the American cinemas "Invictus: the Unbeaten", which includes part of the life story of the former president of the Republic of South Africa, Nielsona Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has been preserved by Morgan Freeman, who had been allegedly seen by Mandela himself a few years ago.
Matt Damon received the role of the legendary South African champion in Rugby, Francois Pienaar.
With the film's cinematic start, the reactions of critics and the public are also loud.
Nelson Mandela
The name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on 18 July 1918 in Mvez, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakhar Prize, and in 1993 the Nobel Peace Prize, together with the de Klerk.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
Great expectations are set in the film because it comes to cinemas at a time when in South Africa on the one hand it culminates in preparations for the World Championship, but at the same time the media shake the world public with frightening news about the rising racial hatred and the discrimination of the inhabitants by the black ruling majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are consistently positive for the time being, despite numerous reservations against the occupying of the main roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of his own words after the new film.
For many years, I cleared up this role and prepared myself well for it.
Several times I also met Nelson Mandela personally so that I could receive his energy, as I say, he performed in an interview after the festival premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can capture Mandela's personality and his message with this movie.
This is a story of South Africa, but it concerns every person, he added.
In the rugby national team's dress
The film is based on the book by British writer John Carlin, freely translated ́In the role of the enemy ́: Nelson Mandela and the game that has united the people portrays the South African defender of human rights within his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman, in the course of the film, tries to bring together two groups of people, two racially and for years and day apart, and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also plays in his role in the South African National Rügbydress on the world cup field, which then won South Africa.
For entering the race in the dress, which in South Africa is almost like a sacred act, Mandela reaped great ovations fourteen years ago, mostly by the white audience and thus gained the recognition of the white population.
The Rugby Championship may have accomplished bringing people together again to one people, led the Rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa improves, that will only show up.
The white South Africans, however, are sceptical, as in recent interview for LN of the Rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers burn for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformer of the company Ceps in the switchgear near the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
According to the spokesman of Usti County Fire Department, Labem, Lukas Marvan, entered six units at the fire.
Originally, the fire brigade wanted to burn out the transformers, but later it changed its view and now the fire is wiped out with a mixture of water - foam and special wastes.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer incision.
No one was injured, the accident did not endanger the security operation of the management system, according to the company spokesperson Pavla Mandatova.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million crowns, and the damage will only be calculated after the fire.
According to Mandatova, the destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one.
For more than 10 years, nothing similar has happened in the company of Ceps, faults of this kind are rare, she added.
According to the spokesperson of CEZ for Northern Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, the power supply was not interrupted, the fire of the traffic station did not affect the functioning of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps operates in Czech territory as sole operator of the line system, electric lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, refurbishes and develops 39 switching systems with 67 transformers, with which the electrical energy is transferred into distribution system and line line with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jancura filed criminal charges for slander against three head of the CSDD.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, today raises criminal charges for slander against three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute Inteview in the radio journal.
The complaint is linked to the company's efforts to operate regional rail transport in some districts.
All regions, however, have finally signed long-term contracts with the Czech railways.
All three ladders attack us and say that we take out the raisins, in which we have only submitted the offer over the scope as it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech railways because we would know the prices of the Czech railways that were completed last week.
So we have nothing left but to defend ourselves.
Because of this slander by the Society Student Agency, Jancura told the radiojournal.
At the same time, he argued that he has evidence from all districts that they have taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an accusation for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the collection of penalty charges for the further continuation of the Jancura Media Show, which serves him as free advertising for his company as well as for his own person.
I am, of course, ready to defend my good name and the reputation of my district, and I am also calling for further leaders.
I assume that it will also become clear in this matter that it is Jancura who manipulates the public in the case of regional rail traffic and uses lying and false arguments, Hasek said.
Jancura reported last week that he had invested several million crowns in advertising, which will point to the disadvantageous step of the districts.
He told the radio journal that he is interrupting the campaign after Christmas, and that he wants to continue after New Year.
He stated that he would lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign launched Jancura after the districts agreed to operate regional rail transport with the Czech Railway and had not tendered for the contract in a large of around 150 billion crowns.
According to Vancura, such conduct is illegal and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
According to Jancura, because of the criticism of train traffic in the districts, he was already threatened by a member of the CSDD.
The only threat was if we do not refrain from losing our bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSDD, I know who it is, I do not say his name, today Jancura said the radiojournal.
Vaccination against pneumococcal free and voluntary
Infection against pneumococci changes the usual from January onwards.
It should be the first free and voluntary family.
However, votes already report that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
To culminate in preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococci.
The Agency already sets the maximum prices of vaccines to be paid by health insurance companies.
The experts are also aware of the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Vaccines free of charge for August children
From January, children can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococci, which were born on August 2nd last year and later.
The condition is that they have not yet received a dose.
Those who have already started vaccination last year or earlier also have to pay further repetition vaccination themselves.
The first dose must be given between the 3rd and 5th months of life of the child.
Last year, a quarter of the families had their children vaccinated against pneumococci.
The parents paid 1600 kroner and more for one dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the youngest children.
Overall, professionals estimate that the health insurance for vaccination doses spends 300,000 to 450,000 crowns a year.
However, they save on the treatment that children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all vaccinations of the children.
The mandatory vaccination was introduced with the so-called janota package.
Pneumococcal causes middle ear inflammation, but also severe infections including conjunctivitis and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections kill up to 28 children aged up to 10 years after examination in hospitals each year.
Outside the Czech Republic, compulsory vaccination of children against pneumococci was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
As of January, this is to be paid by the insurance companies and voluntary.
For example, the head of the Nahlas Civil Society, Rudolf Kalovsky, mentioned that compulsory vaccination would be better.
His association has long-term advertiser for pneumococcal vaccination.
The experts at the international conference, in which our association was involved, were not very satisfied with our voluntary vaccination.
That's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy that we have succeeded in at least putting this through.
I think that's the way we have to go now, Kalovsky led.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococci.
At this moment we do not consider this at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, asserting the doctors.
The chairman of the specialist company of practical pediatricians, Hana Cabrochova, admits that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, then one could think about reducing the number of repeat vaccinations "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as voluntary," says Cabronochova.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to have their infants vaccinated against pneumococci from next year.
Vaccination against pneumococci is also groundbreaking in that it is paid for as a first vaccination by the health insurance system and not by the state.
Insurance should spend the money on prevention to save them for further treatment, Cabrochova provides.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, this is a concern of the practical pediatricians who are concerned about the purchase of the vaccines.
According to the original project, the vaccines should be purchased by insurance companies and the doctors should then receive them on the same route as other vaccines issued by the State to them.
Some Members, however, feared that the insurance could "exploit the money from health insurance".
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait until the insurance companies pay them.
According to estimates, the individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 crowns per month, which is a significant sum.
It won't be easy at all, says Cabrochova.
US artist son involved in "Museum theft"
The son of famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal paintings worth 20 million dollars from his father's museum.
According to the Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was captured with trailers at the invitation of 90 paintings in his vehicle.
It says Frank Frazetta junior and another man would have used a excavator to penetrate the museum into the Pocono mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his portrayal of such figures as Conan of Barbar and Tarzan.
As reported by the news agency Associated Press, the artist stopped at the time of the incident in Florida.
AP quoted an unidentified police officer who said that Frank Frazetta Junior could have been motivated by a family feud.
The agency reported, according to a police oath-making statement, Frazetta Junior claimed that he was instructed by his father, "that he should enter the museum with all the means to bring all the paintings into storage".
The agency reported that Frank Frazetta argued that he had granted any permission.
Labour defends budget and tax increases
Ministers defended the tax increases and expenditure stops announced in the preliminary report against the criticism of opposition, the economy and trade unions.
The Conservatives said that Alistair Darling had had an opportunity to "disperse" to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by pushing the decisions out until after the election.
The treasurer also took the initiative to target low- and medium-income workers.
Its main proposals include a 0.5% increase in social security and a 1% cut-off in the public payroll for 2011.
Social security contributions
The trade unions have protested, however, that low-wage beneficiaries are punished for a recession that they have not caused and warned of forthcoming "problems".
The increase in social security - to some 3 billion pounds per year - has made the private sector worse, which says that this is a tax on jobs, although the focus should be on the economic upturn.
The increase, limited to those who earn more than £20,000 a year, will affect about 10 million workers.
FISHING POINTS OF THE PREAB ETATORY REPORT
A further 0.5% increase in social security from April 2011 onwards
This year, economic downturn of more than the expected 4.75%
New 50% tax on banker bonuses
1 percent increase in corporation tax rejected for small businesses
Tax reductions for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase of government pensions by 2.5%
According to estimates from the Treasury, someone with an annual income of £30,000 by £90 per year will be poorer and someone with £40,000 a year will be about £190 poorer, while a person with £10,000 annual income will be £110 richer.
Ministers said that their target of deficit halving by 2013 means "difficult decisions", but they also said that 60% of the additional taxes would be paid to 5% of the top earners.
Minister of Finance Stephen Timms argues that the sketched tax increases and expenditure stops compared to the necessary measures would be "a drop on the hot stone".
"These are big numbers. They will bring us the deficit halving and this is also absolutely necessary over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
Labour Party predictions about future economic growth – which influences the level of re-indebtedness and the speed of the deficit settlement – were questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revise earlier figures.
He said in his opinion that the economy will probably shrink by 4.75% this year - much more than the 3.5% drop predicted in April - while debt would be £3 billion higher than previously estimated.
"Forgotten Opportunity"
The Conservatives, who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn Labour of the "punishment crisis", said that the planned debt of 789 billion pounds was unsustainable over the next six years.
They added that the ministers have failed to present a credible plan, how they will repay it and press "cyclically" for difficult decisions until after the election - which must take place by June 2010 at the latest.
"They didn't say anything about what they're going to do," said shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had their chance to do this, and they let it pass."
"The significant announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them".
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police are preserved from future cuts, unlike the Conservative proposals, which see the deficit capping coming faster and more quickly.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money gained by the tax increases and spending stops is used to cover next year's expenditure, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are "built on sand".
The BBC’s political editor, Nick Robinson, said that at the time of the announcements – like the above inflation adjustment in some invalid pensions next April – the treasurer would put off the call for a vote, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing extra assistance when people need it most and that the situation is reviewed again in September 2010.
"Hohler Etat"
Although ministers have not announced any budget details beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public spending will only come to fruition in the medium term.
The recognised Tax Investigation Institute said that the Chancellor's figures would mean strong cuts in many areas, possibly in the future also in the areas of transport, higher education, science and defence.
"It only shifts the pain on later," said his director Robert Chote.
"The significant announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins them," added Roger Bootle, business consultant at the Deloitte business review company.
"This was just the hollow pre-eat report. Markets recognize this."
FBI Investigates US Citizens' Meetings in Pakistan
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported U.S. citizens because of the suspicion of extremist connections in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in an attack on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Panjab province, the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan informed the BBC.
The FBI said it's being investigated whether these are the same men who were reported missing last month in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. State Department said they were looking for information about the men.
Three of them are to be Pakistani, one is Egyptian, and the other has a Yemeni background.
"If they are American citizens, of course, we are very interested in the charges they are accused of and under what circumstances they are being held," said Ian Kelly.
FBI spokesman Katherine Schweit said the authority was informed about the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We work with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there if they are actually the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington reported that the men were arrested in a house that belonged to the uncle of one of the students.
He said the local police had previously been interested in the house and that no charges were filed against the arrested men.
The Reuters news agency reported that it refused to comment on the arrests, but she said that the US "must work with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism, which continues to recruit and train people".
The five students were reported missing by your families in northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns "mistakes" in Iran
According to a report by the Amnesty International Human Rights Organization, it is still as bad about human rights in Iran as it has been in the last 20 years.
The report details "misuse patterns" by the regime, both before and after the presidential elections in June.
One man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected previous criticisms of its human rights balance.
Official authorities said that such criticism was politically motivated.
After the contested election of President Mahmud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested and dozens killed in Iran, leading to the largest street protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
A dozen prisoners and prosecutors said that at least five people were sentenced to death.
The BBC Teheran correspondent Jon Leyne, now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests of the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recognized some of the abuse claims and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak Strafanstalt.
But since then there has been no tolerance on the part of the authorities for criticism, our correspondent said.
False Consciousness
Amnesty International quoted the report of 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said that he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting against election results.
"They hit me in the face more often," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head. They threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days he signed a false confession and, still bleeding and half unconscious, released on the street, told Amnesty.
The beaten presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrators who had been arrested after the election were tortured to death in August in prison and others raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the rape charges, but admitted that abuses took place.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of a former prisoner who said that he had been detained with 75 others for more than eight weeks in a container in a prison in Kahrizak.
Amnesty recognized that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authorities had set up a committee to investigate the unrest following the election and the reaction of the government, but that Amnesty, the mandate and the power of these bodies would be unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees had not been published.
The group said that in the last three weeks at least 90 people have been arrested to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang was decorated in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a landmark into a competition piste in Bristol.
The ski slopes of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for money prices.
On the tip of the slope in the Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump edge at the beginning of a 100 meter long slope.
Student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the peak of the slope, but it was also quite frightening.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city that flash below.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some real talents."
Prizes were awarded for the best works of art executed on the slope - or tricks.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow is left to melt.
Always her and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters voted for a ban on minarette construction and the concern about the alleged Islamization of Europe is widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a well-founded and well-considered report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of the most declared secularized societies in Europe — and integrated.
Some readers will read this new book out of admiration for the author's last work: "Why the French don't love headscarves" (2006), an elegant and highly argumentative study of an issue that shared and occupied the country over a period of a year and a half and its effects are still to be seen today.
Bowen's newest book offers a wider and bolder spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what really happens in this area.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes, which now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls it "Islamic Spaces".
He is a good listener, he restores debates between teachers and students on the questions they are most concerned about.
Should a Muslim marry (or both) in a mosque or a town hall?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and the rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use a interest-oriented banking system to obtain a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profaning matters, he claims, which make up daily life, quite unlike the political dramas that the media employ.
The author recognizes a new generation of Imamen, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, a Swiss-born Arabic-Muslim scholar and academic.
This new generation is trying to open up the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen in a modern secular society on the other.
They don't have all the arguments on their side.
Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists surveyed by the Bowen are mostly disagreeable with their Salafi counterparts – defenders of purist Sunni Islam, which is linked to Saudi Arabia – who today show a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But a convention requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questions to what extent French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite, who so passionately guarded the separation of church and state) really feel committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience a more harsh treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who had to make their historic compromise with secular republicanism.
He recognizes rather a "digestion of the value screws" than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book one is inclined to say "Yes, but not yet".
The Most Disturbed Outlook of the World
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on earth.
The ice that she marks melts at alarming speeds and takes life with her, which cannot survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have gone into the newly open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their wakewaters.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws in "On Thin Ice" a natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear.
In the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic researchers who have proved themselves to be hunting on the polar bears.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with an polar bear as a brave 14-year-old ensign to the lake, who fought only with the gunshot of his muskete, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were brought into zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears in a performance.
Even today, zoos still typically have a millionth of the habitat of a wild old animal. The climate is rare: the polar bear in Singapore has become quite green from the algae that grow in the hollow hair of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat posed by hunters for the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, construction continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters use powerful storm rifles in helicopters and engine-slattering inuit to take their prey.
Ironically, the ice will remain the longest in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations.
In his new book "After the Ice", Alum Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a gripping insight into how the future might develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of the changes.
However, this is not due to a lack of explanations.
The pioneers of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries for the first time had the pack ice swirled.
In the Cold War, submersible boats measure the moving caverns during the siege.
A useful supplement are satellite measurements and the large-scale application of measuring probes on icebergs, but still much is achieved by fearless people camping outside in the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the peculiar, tiny world of the inflow system within the Arctic ice formed by the saltwater basin, which is pressed together during freezing.
But, starting from the bear on the ice to the microscopic wonders in the ice, all are threatened by the summer ice passing, which is expected between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months...the we could be"
Marine infantry were among the 6,000 who settled in Arlington Kranze
The Top Free De'Angello Robinson traveled seven hours by bus to lay a single crack on the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marine Infantry who made the trip from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women who stepped in their footsteps.
In a few months, wherever we're brought back, we could be that, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I'd like someone to do the same for me, so I'm trying to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to lay cranes on the graves of veterans in several sections of Arlington Peace Court.
Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992, when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the Arlington cemetery.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who make this journey every year, stop in various cities along the way to carry out events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America (Cranes across America), which has extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 crags on the graves at Arlington Cemetery, at the Pentagon, on the tombs of the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York, and at the memorial site for the United-Airlines-Flug 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second time, the Walmart Foundation donated more than 150,000 dollars to buy and transport the cranes.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster said that she made the journey to Arlington in memory of her husband, a dead professional soldier.
Although her husband has not been buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is their way to return to those who made sacrifices.
She said this is a small contribution, as we civilians can support our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Packed in warm clothes, the volunteers wandered across the extensive lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older graves from the 1st and 2nd World War and the Vietnam War as a goal, as these are not visited as often as the newer graves, the organizers said.
The mood was happy, children played and couples held their hands while carrying the fresh pine branches to the gray tombstones.
Each round crane was dark green with a small red loop attached to the upper part.
Section 60, which is nearby and where mainly veterans of wars have been buried in Iraq and Afghanistan, remained almost quiet.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crates to decorate this section, but the gloomy mood of the current wars filled this area.
Individuals cried openly, others prayed and families and friends clung together in the icy air.
Some read aloud the names carved in stone, while others bowed down to small black-and-white space cards, which had been stuck in the damp mud for those whose tombstones had not yet been finished.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who shed bitter tears before the tomb of her son.
She was driven 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the burial site of Marine Infancy Deputy Officer David Shane Spicer, who fell in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free... my son paid for it, she said.
"If I haven't been around for a long time, I want someone to remember him."
Contractors arrested by the US government of Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a US government contractor who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, said representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for customers, such as USAID, the US Office for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officers from the US representation of interests in Havana are trying to gain access to the prisoner arrested on December 5.
The special charges have not yet been published, although according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost everything under the charge of "danger".
All so-called counterrevolutionary activities, including light protests and critical writings, are at risk of arrest.
Governmental hostile graffiti and statements are considered a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community, led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who more often describes how they and their husband are persecuted and attacked by government representatives.
Sánchez has repeatedly asked for an authorisation to leave the country to receive prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase the tension between the Communist government of the Castro Brothers in Cuba and the Obama government, which had sought a "slow" approach to improving relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported on Friday night by the New York Times.
The new US policy stresses that the United States will make a contribution if the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and sought after products in a country where the average earnings of a government employee are 15 dollars per month.
Since this year, the Cuban government has only allowed ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone, they are currently used for sending text messages, as a 15-minute telephone call would cost a daily wage.
Internet usage is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government agencies, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Too many websites are restricted.
In Cuba, an American's arrest is rare.
Most of the few US citizens in Cuba are in prison for crimes such as drug smuggling behind bars, said Gloria Berbena, the press spokesperson of the US Office of Interest in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't give any more information to arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
One activity that would be legal in any other free society - the delivery of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the Human Rights Watch group, which recently released a hard report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, the same Cuba", an allusion to the establishment of Raul Castro as the leader of the country who replaced the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants were very often arrested, sentenced and detained within one day.
He said that probably any solution would be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time when both countries are moving towards more dialogue.
Pakistani government representatives are planning to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities discovered a allegedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. soldiers, and said that they hope that this case could help to detect an extensive network of terrorist applicants searching the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said that they had sought an opaque insurgent, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had found them, because one of them had submitted comments on terrorist attacks on the Internet video page YouTube.
Saifullah became the leader of these men after their arrival in Pakistan and tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan’s tribal belt, which is the home of Al Kaida and his terrorist training camp.
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence, who was informed about the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah could not convince the Al-Qaeda leaders that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to undermine the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held over days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the unreal mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refuge.
They were considered part of a hidden operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government official, who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said that the men were by no means discouraged and tried to get the right recommendations to gain access to Al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement authorities.
The case of the five men - who remain in Pakistan and are interviewed by the FBI - underlines the crucial role of applicants in identifying future terrorists and perhaps even more importantly, in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, US intelligence has made it one of the most urgent to accommodate human asset items within Al Kaida.
The applicants of the organization act as gatekeepers who do not let in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
American willow recruits are subjected by A Kaida to a special test, said analysts.
However, because of their potential access to US targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered highly attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, top-ranking analyst of the NEFA Foundation based in the USA, said that terrorist groups have become much more cautious in recent years as to whom they allow access, because the US secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to drag someone into these groups, what better way could you go than following the recruitment model that so many have followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is now based much more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators demand climate action in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets on Saturday and demanded that the negotiators at the Bella Congress Centre in the city take bolder action in the field of climate protection.
The demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, whereas police estimates were more of about 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists lit small explosives near some government buildings in the city center.
On one day when the climate negotiations supported by the UN did not happen, thousands of activists migrated through the city with transparent people on whom there was "no planet B" in English and one in Spanish, which said "The Earth says "Enough".
Some stars joined the protest, such as the Danish model, the photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the journeys to Peru, her mother's country of birth, make her aware of the heartbreaking problems the country has to face because of the already noticeable effects of climate change.
That is part of the reasons why I decided to take part in the big demonstration - to continue the word and appeal to the world leaders, to establish a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it needs to be done now and there is no more way to get around it.
The police stopped the demonstrators from coming too close to the Bella Centre and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or carried pocket knives.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited in the event of demonstrations.
According to a viewer who did not want to be called, since he is involved in the climate negotiations, demonstrators in black clothing masked several explosive bodies near the Copenhagen main channel, near which several ministries are located.
They threw them near the buildings, he said and added that they started as beacons, but then followed by "a few major explosions".
Inside the convention center, people gathered in front of TV screens to observe the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest has apparently not reached the consciousness of the main functionaries, such as Su Wie, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought that the demonstration had a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: "This is something I was not aware of at all."
He then went on to Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is large, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He noted that it depended on the individual’s perspective whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the topic of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they interfere with the negotiations or the freedom of other people".
Test data show persistent cracking of race
The evidence of mathematics performance was welcome last week for the public schools in Washington, D.C.
Although Washington’s district is still far behind the high-performance schools of the country, the evidence shows that the four- and eight-pieces have made progress in the past two years faster than cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
However, what is included in the latest figures in the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the persistent gap between African and white students, both at local and national level.
In the last two years, the average score of the four-cylinder whites from Washington D.C. rose from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), which their Afro-American counterparts only rose by three points from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually increased from 53 points to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the African-American eight-pieces was basically the same, he fell by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data, as the sample number was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not more encouraging.
The gap, which separated white and black four-pieces in 2003, when the first NAEP was recorded in this district, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the score that children of both groups have reached has grown over this period of time, the difference with now 58 points has hardly diminished.
Some district education supporters expressed concern last week that the results celebrated by school Chancellor Michelle A. Rheine and the democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty, mostly of white students who are already powerful children, were advanced.
This suggests that we have raised the overall score by treating those at the upper end of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, Executive Board member of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that advocates equality of education in Washington D.C.
I do not jump up for a span of two or three points and lower down, said Democratic Washington City Councillor Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth grade of the Eaton primary school.
Brown, a common critic of Rhee's management style, said that the message of examination points is that the city's secondary schools urgently need attention.
Of course you always want to see the positive signs, I respect that.
But what scares me is that we do not spend the time and energy we need to use for our middle school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the low-performance students.
In this autumn, for example, some teachers are trained to use a new learning plan, the Wilson-Lese system, aimed at students in the upper classes of primary and secondary school, which did not master the basic skills of reading at the beginning of their school career and which are significantly behind their peers of the same age.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum that takes priority from kindergarten to sixth grade games and lifelong experiences, was brought to Washington under former senior school inspector Clifford Janey, and this curriculum is attributed to some of the NAEP advances reported last week.
I believe that we must continue to work to make the best efforts available to students who are below the level of grades, said Rhee.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system and continue to provide the additional money and resources for the low-performance schools needed to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rheine, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, which investigates urban test results.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms on the schools located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C.
The objective could lead to political repercussions that are working against this important item on the agenda.
The weak point, as with other city school inspectors, is, of course, that she tries to keep the white and black middle layer.
Our focus is to ensure that we set up a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the districts so that all families, wherever they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now the school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements to shut down the performance gap is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with the charter schools.
One has to increase the school year to nearly 200 days in order to have the power to change, said Janey, who, with his teacher's union last year, came to an agreement over 185 days a year which he considered to be "a milestone" on the way to a larger increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than future prospects
The bus reaches the Gettysburg College with a loud pipe.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, rises and flashes a moment when the white pillars, the brick facades and the emerald green lawn appear.
Graciela's parents have hardly finished high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was saved in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and the other eight-pieces of the group, who explore Gettysburg, where lessons per year cost 38,690 dollars, was more the arrogance of a visitor than that of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes! Here I will be soon!" cried Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the leader announced that they had now entered the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she thoughtfully said when she was reported the low professor-to-student relationship of the school.
The college in Pennsylvania was the 7th one that children visited on their three-day tour and now they have taken up the intended message completely: The question is not whether to go to college.
The question is, where.
On the one hand, there is a growing concern about the large number of children born in the USA of Hispanic immigrants who do not finish high school or become pregnant as a teenager, but on the other hand there are also hundreds of thousands who receive college training needed to get up to the middle class.
In fact, one of five of the "second generation" of Hispanics concludes the college – which is a remarkable achievement, since many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without completing the high school.
Their success stories are important, say researchers, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country's workforce.
Those who study powerful children often say that they have a natural affinity for the school and a driving force inherent in them to success.
Many of them also have parents who set their children high goals and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But advisory programmes also play a major role by helping Graciela and millions of children like them come to college, especially if these efforts continue over a longer period of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them find their way through the system, then a single measure will not solve the problem either at any time, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California in Davis, who investigated Hispano-American students.
We need to think about providing these children with a supporting network from preschool to high school.
The Federal Programme, which Gracielas College Tour had financed, is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - Turning a gear up - and provides more than 300 million dollars a year for local school systems to start college preparatory programs that start when low-income pupils are in middle school and continue to run until they finish high school.
According to the US Department of Education, the programme has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, more than 60% of whom have gone to college.
Iraqi Ministry of Oil to conclude contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to restore its damaged infrastructure at two auctions closed on Saturday.
The 10 contracts concluded with foreign oil companies by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil indicate that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralyzed by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies could only book shares in two of the 10 sold fields.
Seven American companies had paid for participating in the second auction, which started on Friday.
The only company that made a bid drew the shorter one.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The thin-seeded representatives of American oil pulp at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after 6 years of war and instead of US companies, Asian and European, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns still highlighted by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and the political instability caused by the US military's withdrawal probably prevented American oil companies, said analysts to commit themselves more strongly in Iraq, which has the third largest proven crude oil reserves in the world.
In some cases, US companies were disadvantaged because competitors, especially Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not have to account shareholders.
Exxon-Mobile and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that were able to conclude contracts with the Ministry.
Larger U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who maintain close relations with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and have been sidelined with technical advice in recent years, have left empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main actors in two of the contracts promised this weekend.
The state of China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and was able to go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Oil, Assam Jihad said that China is about to become one of the greats of the world economy as well as a technological power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be able to measure itself with its partners and fulfil its obligations towards Iraq.
For the pre-selected companies, bids were issued, which were then compared with the fee per barrel of oil that the ministry was willing to pay to increase the output of each field beyond the current level.
Top Planer of Al Kaida Apparently Killed in Pakistan
In the event of an obvious U.S. missile attack along the Pakistani border to Afghanistan, a top deployment planner of Al Kaida is due to have been killed this week, as reported by representatives of the U.S. counter-terrorism on Friday.
This would be the second deadly attack, if it were confirmed, on a high level of responsibility by the terrorist organization this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who were supposed to have been killed by a number of rockets, according to US sources and Pakistani authorities in the region, who met their vehicle near the city of Miran Shah in the province of North Waziristan on Tuesday.
Local authorities reported that the rockets were fired by a drone type used by the CIA in Pakistan’s illegal tribal belt.
They drove in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, a representative of a Pakistani civilian intelligence from Miran Shah said by phone.
Local residents suspected of belonging to the militants ran to the place and quickly took everything that was left of the "completely destroyed bodies".
The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the US counter-terrorism led to undecided evidence that Somalia was one of the dead.
Somalia was described as the leading military planner of Al Kaida who led operations of terrorist groups outside Afghanistan-Pakistan.
He was involved in conspiracies around the world, noticed a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous, and pointed to the delicate nature of the American air raids on Pakistani soil.
Taking its central role as given, this included planning attacks against the US and Europe.
He accepted strategic instructions from Al Kaida's top leaders and implemented them in operations plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said that Somalia had risen rapidly in the Al-Qaeda hierarchy and maintained best connections with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, said the second representative of the authorities, but this in no way reduces the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If his death were confirmed, Somalia would be the second leading Al-Qaeda or Taliban leader who has been killed since September than in a similar attack by Najmuddin Jalololov, the leader of a militant group in the tribal area and three other top activists.
Since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website supported by a non-profit organization, the rate of attacks by the CIA has declined from an average of six operations per month to two.
The decline may be based on improved tactics of terrorist groups, which have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability while brutally killing suspects.
Leading UN envoys in Kabul will resign
On Friday, the leading UN envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said that he would resign from his office in March, ending a stormy term of office that was marred by allegations of widespread corruption in the Afghan presidential elections supported by the UN.
The oath takes place when the Obama government has decided to send another 30,000 U.S. soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supported the increase in troops, but he also expressed his concern that the US military withdrawal plan, which was due to begin in 18 months, could cause other NATO governments to withdraw their armed forces.
We need to speed up the construction of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, said Eide in a phone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilians to help in Afghanistan's political transition.
The army increase on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he did not give up his office, but only completed an agreement with his family in March 2008 to remain in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted this notification to UNO.
Mr Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General, now forward so that he has time to make provision for a replacement.
What I said is that he's better off looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN representatives, Ban has begun the search for a replacement.
The UN representatives say that he considered the Swedish-Italian-stolen Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously led UN peace operations.
Eiden's position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, had accused him in September of prefering President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country and hiding evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide refused all accusations, but he also said that the accusations of Galbraith - who was fired - "has undoubtedly caused damage to the mission, because there was already a great deal of scepticism about international interference in the election."
Eide said that he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the aid measures of the US-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also insisted that the UN leadership would allow his successor to employ more personnel from the United States and other Western countries who donated to the Afghan mission, and said that this would strengthen their confidence in their money being properly spent.
Eide expressed his disappointment at the limitation of his forces in Afghanistan and said that the clumsy UN adjustment arrangements have undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed in such a way that since May, he said I could only hire one person.
This is catastrophic and must not go on like this.
US Secretary of Defense Gates: Iran has to expect additional sanctions
Minister of Defense Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world powers will soon be "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because he did not take part in talks about his nuclear plans.
Gates spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq during a 7-day journey through the war areas of Afghanistan and Iraq and took the view of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran there are no good options to choose, he said in response to the question of a soldier about the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things that lie on my soul is if we have learned something from Iraq in the last six years that the war has its own unforeseeableness."
The Obama Government is considering a sanction package aimed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranians.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is necessary "to convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected by nuclear weapons" because "their people will suffer terrible" sanctions.
On Friday, in a White House Speaker's opinion, Robert Gibbs, the US government joined the European leaders in warning that Iran must expect "credible" consequences if it fails to meet the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear monitoring organisation, the International Atomic Energy Agency, with its nuclear programme.
Iran continues to claim that knowledge of nuclear technology should only be gained for peaceful purposes.
During talks in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that it would resume discussions on the limitation of its nuclear programme and refrain from any substantial part of its stock of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The US government has forced this kind of agreement to build trust between the two parties and to win time for negotiations.
However, since that time, Iran seems to have left the negotiations on the provisional agreements - partly, experts say, because the Iranian leadership disagrees on whether or not it should commit itself to the United States.
The fact that Iran simply left the international community with regard to some of the proposals that they had already agreed to at the beginning of October has made it clear that the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, brought together in a way that it never had been in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran, said Gates.
President Obama has set the 31st of December as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before continuing to pursue other options, including those that the Foreign Minister, Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton, once called "expressive sanctions".
In an opinion given in New York, the Iranian representation to the United Nations condemned what it called on Thursday "ungroundless and unfounded allegations" by some security council members to Iran's nuclear activities and said that they are ready to continue the talks with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve an appropriate long-term solution".
Gates, who was due to return to Washington on Friday, met the Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before he flew to the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meet with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish authorities in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq remain high, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenues.
Gates urged both sides to lower the potential for conflict in order to prevent delays in the U.S. plans from lowering the US force from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to dispel Kurdish concerns about the imminent withdrawal of troops. U.S. representatives quoted Gates, who said to Masud Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government: "We will receive your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you."
A Change in the Price of Older China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters who gave them lectures that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain other children" and "A baby more means a grave more".
These lessons they have learned so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly started to change the course through the low birth rate and the older population in this summer and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their answer was immediately and finally: "In no case".
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
There is nothing left for a second child, said Wang, 31, a head of staff with an 8-month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notorically thick, poisoned single children, who are affectionately called "little emperors", a population crisis is rising in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time this policy came into force.
The section on population issues is set to increase from 16.7 per cent of the population by 2050 to 31.1 per cent of the population aged 60 and over by 2050, which is well above the global average of around 20 per cent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older people accounted for almost 22 percent of Shanghai's reported residents, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai City and Family Planning Commission, said that couples of childbearing age need to have babies to "help reduce the ratio of older people to reduce the labour shortage of the future".
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as the industrialized countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
In the Constitution of the country in 1978, China's one-child policy is probably the most controversial option that has been introduced by the ruling Communist Party to this day.
Couples who violate this policy have to expect enormous fines -- up to their three-year salary in some regions -- and discrimination at work.
Chinese government representatives have attributed it to this policy that the critical use of natural land resources could be avoided, whereas human rights representatives have condemned abuses in the enforcement of politics.
In rural regions, some officials who had already had a child have forced them to give up.
Many couples also had sexual abortions carried out, resulting in an unnaturally high relationship between men and women.
Over the last few years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their attitude towards a single-child policy.
In 2004, they approved more exceptions to the rule -- including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities and cases where both husband and wife were single children -- and in 2007 the tone of many hard slogans was reduced.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute for Population Research at the University of Beijing, said that government representatives recently even discussed more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children with whom a partner is a single child.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births in July.
Posters that taught families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by guidelines that describe in detail who is coming for a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration has sent city staff and family planning volunteers to visit couples at home and to move information sheets under the doors.
She also asked for psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The reaction was not exactly encouraging, said family planning representatives.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a small rural town in the outlying areas of Shanghai said that an upturn in requests from couples who want to have a second child after the campaign, the urban districts do not report any change.
In the municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000, an example is still only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births expected for 2010 in the city will still be about 165.000 -- slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Shanghai municipality of Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don't want to have children anymore.
They want to give the best to their first, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and that they would be legally allowed to do so.
But they have, like many Chinese, only a minor health and life insurance from the government.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West misappropriate the one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, we are deprived of the opportunity to have more than one child.
But the problem is not simply a political one.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for her hesitation.
Wang, the head of staff, said she only wants one child because she was also a single child. "We were the center of the family and used to let everyone take care of us.
We are not used to taking care of others, nor do we really want to do this."
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old, to whom a translation company belongs, said it unblemished.
For middle class parents with double careers, through which the birth rate drops, he said it turns out to be successful and one has to be selfish.
The age group of 20- to 39-year-olds today grew up to see their parents fight during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment and they do not want such a life for themselves, he said.
Also a single child, he said, places enormous demands on the parents’ time.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there's the space question -- "You have to rebuild his apartment" -- and the life plan -- "If the child is 9 months old, you have to already have a CV prepared for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to go through this once, said Chen, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
UNO Group is developing emission reduction plan
The UN-funded climate conference - which has so far been characterised by wild poses and mutual accusations - once again focused on Friday with the publication of a document, which will record an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with the industrial nations shouldering the greatest burdens in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, has shown both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But it was seen as important progress in a negotiation that is due to take place, as next week more than 100 top politicians from all over the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text, formulated by a UN working group specifically created for this purpose, rests on the amount of money that rich countries should give to poor countries so that they can cope with global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrial and large emerging countries can limit their carbon emissions and how high should be the upper limit of the global temperature rise that political decision-makers would bring.
The process will provide great flexibility, said John Coequyt, director of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has designed the six-page document, has compiled a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the leading climate protection representative of the UN, Yvo de Boer, has called "the great whole".
It shows the basic outline of a possible agreement by which the industrial nations would jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared with the 1990 limit values, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent over the same period.
Together, countries could cut emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community has also given an impetus to Friday's talks through its assurance to provide USD 3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change - from the masters of floods and droughts to the avoidance of deforestation.
The Friday still brought the same verbal fireworks that the talks had scheduled in the last week.
The American climate expert Todd Stern has rejected formulations calling for binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for developed countries, compared with voluntary reductions for larger emerging countries, if they are not financed by the industrial nations.
This train announced that the Obama government is going through a tougher line with China, as representatives of the Bush administration not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign agreements without larger emerging economies and taking action, so Star, who also complained that the text did not go far enough, ensuring that the reductions could also be confirmed by outside parties.
Stern made his statement one hour after the Chinese Deputy Secretary of State He Yafei said that it was either a lack of "reason" for the leading American climate negotiator or it was "very irresponsible" of him that he said at the beginning of the week that the United States would not help China financially to cope with global warming.
As a result of the future economic trend of the great world powers at stake, there have been break lines both within the industrial nations and between the industrialized nations and the emerging economies.
The current struggle is equally related to the rescue of individual economists, as well as to the rescue of the planet, where China and the United States were in a position to live up to their obligations, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder measures.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the great powers are fighting for who should bear the cost of curbing greenhouse gas emissions, since even affected countries have gone over to aggressively taking action to bring the countries with very high greenhouse gas tax to account for their actions.
This is clearly a game from which a new economic dominance will develop, says Ulate, who is also working as regional climate change consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the effects of climate change reported that they would continue to fight for a legally binding contract in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the talks will lead to a political agreement in the best case.
The alliance of small island states with 43 members presented a 24-page draft contract on the early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the small island states "has political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now united and demand measures from emerging countries, such as China and India.
The talks had a new urgency as the delegates focused on the fact that most open questions had to be resolved before the arrival of the Heads of Government in order to reach an agreement.
High-ranking representatives, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Vice-Minister, stepped off their aircraft and rushed through the corridors of the Bella Center to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to remove claims negotiated next week.
The pure extent of the assembly -- 13,000 people go into and out every day at the convention center, guitar-playing activists organize nightly shows in which they make fun of the countries that feel betrayed and sold, and draft contracts are passed by hand instead of by e-mail -- are already a challenge.
The intensity is building up just now: almost all the important ministers are here now and from Wednesday 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We come to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice President for Global Policy of the Organization Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
Great Britain's first 225 km/h faster train defines the Monday feeling new
Monday morning at 5 p.m., a pipe will penetrate the darkness to announce a train departure which represents a revolution in traffic in Britain.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country will reach 225 km/h in London St. Pancras during its flash drive from Ashfort, Kent, and back 93 km in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, Dame Kelly Holmes will be on board the first Javelin pendler service from London.
He hopes that the new service will eventually connect Britain to an international rail network faster, more reliable trains and connect the large conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become vibrant commuters, working hours would be radically reduced and the shift from aircraft and car to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds required for the construction of a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental damage could still be a brake on British high-speed rail.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to present a feasibility study to the government, will present Lord Adonis, according to the Times, the report on 30 December.
This gives it a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line to link London to the West Midlands will pass with a capacity of five metres to urban areas and places where the impact on the environment is controversial.
In the free area, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 is also designed to provide three options for a larger, north-facing high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond to it in the spring.
The preferred proposed option is a Y-shaped route where a single high-speed route would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would split into or near Birmingham and a branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another towards the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best-functioning option," said a railway insider.
After completion, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travellers to set off the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared to today a little over an hour.
The drafts provide for trains to drive at a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first route was planned in such a way that 400 metres of long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can ride on it.
Up to 18 trains could be operated per hour on the London-Birmingham route.
This, in turn, would mean that a terminal station would be necessary in London, where 20,000 travellers could be completed per hour.
Given the spatial constraints in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether this plan should be continued in his opinion or not, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will be taken only after the parliamentary elections.
But even if he sets the wheels in motion, the rail network has to be built in sections.
The trains would first have to change from the high-speed routes on existing rail routes to the north of Birmingham, which would keep the journey time between London and Scotland for more than three hours.
This is considered to be a decisive point of impact in order to ensure a change from the aircraft to the rail, an indicative measure for the rail revolution.
Tax payers will receive a mortgage for 75,000 pounds-orgaining of a conservative
Alan Duncan, the leading sub-house member of the Conservatives, has charged thousands of pounds per year to the taxpayer for the cost of an orangery that he was building in his residence in his constituency.
The prison spokesman of the party, who was demolished by David Cameron because he complained that lower house members must live "by lean rations", has increased his mortgage by 75,000 pounds to build an oak wood factory building on his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the additional interest income, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The people responsible for the lower house approved the applications at that time and they were not questioned by Sir Thomas Lag who carried out a review of the expenses of the lower house members. Last night Duncan said that the applications could not be "cleaner or more understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest lower house members, has a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have reached a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Fees Office, a spending control unit of the basement, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he built a winter garden called "orangerie" in the plans.
Neighbors described him as a "glasshouse for entertainment".
The Committee on Standards and Privileges did not call on Duncan to comment on the increase in the amount of money available to him in the course of a recent investigation into his previous mortgage contracts.
The Committee acquitted him last month after examining his expenditure on the breach of the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a mortgage of over 271,406 pounds (300.000 euros) from his London house to his constituency, which he had purchased in 1991, one year before his election as a Member of Parliament.
This week published documents show that Duncan received approximately 1,400 pounds per month as a mortgage interest by March last year.
In April, his claims increased to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The interest rate of Duncan's RBS mortgage has not changed during this period, suggesting that the total increase in the funding of 75,000 pounds (85,000 euros) was used.
The normal stepless RBS mortgage interest rate fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, where it is still standing.
The latest documents published by the House of Commons show that Duncan continued to exercise his right to £1,250 (€1,400) per month in this May.
Duncan lost his post as opposition leader of the House after an undercover reporter filmed him in September when he said after the spending scandal that parliamentarians would live "by lean rations".
"In essence, if you work for the state, you have to live on leaner ratios and be treated as S*****e."
He said, "I have spent my money on my garden and claim a small part disappearing, measured by what is in it.
And I could have demanded the whole damn sum, but I don't do it."
The Member of Parliament, a millionaire from his former career as an oil wholesaler, was first attacked in May because of his spending, when it became clear that he had asked thousands of pounds for his garden before he had clarified with the Fees Office that this could be considered "excessive demand".
As a protester in Duncan's lawn, an activist dug a hole in the form of a pound mark after he had been known to have asked 4,000 pounds for over three years.
When he was asked about the increased mortgage last night, Duncan said: "This was approved by the Fees Office as well as following by Legg to increase the value."
He added: "There is no debate about deviations and slippings or a bending of the rules or the same.
Everything is perfectly transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn't even be cleaner and clearer."
Come all their believers to admire Brighton's beach hut convention calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new life content as an interactive Advent calendar for the winter months.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that stimulates spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for every December day with Christmas songs as a theme.
The event started on December 1st and visitors were allowed to watch the newest cottage every day from 17:30 to 18:30 with free sparkling wine and traditional Mince Pies, filled with dried fruits.
The Christmas songs so far selected are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël", where the hat decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an honorary cleric of the Chichester Diocese and director of Beyond.
He said: "We want to make religion more important for people in a post-Christian society.
As a church, why do we expect people to come into a strange old building? I think the church should go to the people and organize enthusiastic celebrations.
The idea of the beach hut convention calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantasticly creative and lively place and we try to express it through our spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated on Saturdays worldwide and in Copenhagen to call for an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against climate warming, where the police have made hundreds of arrests.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, have been marched in the cold of the Danish capital, on the edge of the United Nations Climate Change Conference, which should lead to a conclusion by Friday, which could enter into force from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish chairman of the climate conference, the increasing mobilisation in the world contributes to the climate, which is illustrated by these demonstrations that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, completely dressed in black, smashed windows with paving stones and hammers, found an AFP journalist.
Anti-unrest policemen have taken action immediately and without consideration.
The police have announced that, according to your opinion, 600 to 700 people, mainly members of "the Blacks Blocs", of these extremely violent splitter groups, who have already become famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, were arrested in the east of France, in April.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the demonstrators, has arrested the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters have been "without distinction", sharply criticized, and has underlined that about a hundred of you "were held in the streets on Saturday evening" despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and in a seat position.
The rather peaceful train has gone from Parliament towards the Bella Center where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters away from the building without trying to get in.
A stage was installed to welcome the intended speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African archbishop Desmond Tutu.
Most of the demonstrators have arrived with buses and trains from the major European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans were present, as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of you with sky blue raincoats, have made a first run in the morning in Copenhagen, as you have followed the call of Earth's friends to create "blue tides" for the "climate justice".
Today we are going on the streets to demand a restitution of ecological blame in favour of the south, said Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't go on and say, "We have time," said Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, watercourses where you can walk, just as it has never been the case in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of globalization critics has approached environmental organisations.
European MP José Bové, the figure of the critics of globalisation, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "Climate justice and social justice": "Today there are no differences between the struggle against climate warming and the struggle for another world."
The Asian-Pacific space, where there are many islands, which are particularly endangered as a result of warming, has given the start-up shot for the demonstrations.
According to the organizers in Australia, about 50,000 people have gone to the streets.
In Manila there were several hundred people, mostly students marched in red and rode bandanas in which you praised solar energy.
In Hong Kong or in Djakarta, but also in Canada, marches of a few hundred demonstrators took place to demand an energetic approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the "350" network gathered several hundred people, in Paris, in Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
Some people have gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denies that it is a "string" here.
On Saturday Abkhazia elected his president, this happened a little over a year after Moscow had recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as independent, Tbilissi denounced the "Strength".
Some 131,000 people were invited to take part in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war of August 2008 for control of the South-Oscetic region, another Georgian secessionist area that was recognised by Russia.
The polling rooms have closed at 5 p.m. GMT.
Voter participation was about 58% a few hours before polling, according to the electoral commissioner in Abkhazi.
The first preliminary results should be announced during the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the previous president, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, the Georgian President, Mikheil Saakachvili, regrets that Abkhazia is now under Russian-secure total occupation, has declared his press spokesperson, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this area with 216 000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world has seen it as part of Georgia occupied by Russia.
After it had separated itself from Georgia during the 1992-93 conflict, with thousands of people dying, Abkhazia would like to prove by this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, has explained Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have chosen Mr. Bagapch.
She was one of the electors who went to choose a venue in a school in the capital Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the black sea.
Large signs on which Bagapch can be seen on the side of the Russian President and the head of government, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are located everywhere in this small area, which has 216.000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is located in the east of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the electoral process.
We, the Abkhazia people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as an allusion to Moscow's support, especially with regard to the decision to recognise Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, answered and raised a glass of vodka.
The opposition, which was represented by the former Vice-President and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticised the agreements made with Moscow last year, as the one in which Abkhazia left Russia to control the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banca, claims to support neither the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If none of the candidates reaches this limit, a second round must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos Worldwide, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated on Saturdays around the world to demand an ambitious and binding treaty from the Kopenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, at any time ready to use, arrested some 700 people on the edge of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people according to the police, hundreds of thousands according to the organizers have demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which will receive the delegates from 193 countries until December 18, which are in search of an agreement to enter into force on January 1, 2013.
From Parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the center and did not try to penetrate.
A stage was set up to welcome the intended speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African archbishop Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the train had passed, a group of demonstrators, who were dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began to strike discs, a journalist of the AFP found out.
Anti-unrest police officers have immediately circled you and have intervened without consideration by throwing some of you on the ground.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people have been arrested and have made it clear that they are mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent splitter groups, which have already become famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in the east of France, in April.
In the evening, a police officer suffered an injury from a pavement during the incident, in which, according to police officers, about twenty persons were temporarily arrested at the chin. Four vehicles burned near a occupied house.
"We are in control of the extreme groups," said Henrik Jakobsen, the police spokesperson, while the helicopters were breathing in the air.
Most of the demonstrators who travelled by train or own vehicle from large German cities, from London, Amsterdam or from Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in the sky blue raincoat, formed in the morning in Copenhagen after the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to a first group, which should represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice".
"Today we are going to the road to demand that the ecological debt be repaid to the people of the south," said activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't tell ourselves any more : we still have time," says singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa there are rivers that are closed, there are streams that can be run through, which has never been the case before."
The first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of the globalization opponents has approached environmental organisations.
French MEP José Bové said to AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "link climate justice and social justice." "There is no longer any difference today between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The organization Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who turn to the masses.
The Asian-Pacific space, in which there are many islands which are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given rise to demonstrations.
In Australia about 50,000 people have gone on the streets, according to the words of the organizers.
In Manila, several hundred people, in the majority of students, dressed red with Bandanas, made advertising in front of the city administration of the Philippine capital for solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Djakarta, hundreds of protesters have also gathered in an action against climate change.
In France several hundred people joined together during the demonstrations organised by the "Netz der 350", particularly in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
The subjects of geography and history, according to Chatel, emerge strengthened from the school reform of the Lycés.
National Minister of Education Luc Chatel explained in an interview, which appeared in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche", that the subjects of geography and history are strengthened by the school reform of the Lycés, even if they are not required to be taught in the terminal (12th year of school).
"The Première students (11th year of school) now have all four hours of week and the same program", Mr. Chatel confirms.
For the minister "must overcome this hypocrisy", because according to him "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but in general a concentration of "the best students."
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientific," he continued. He stressed: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who would have rebelled about the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminals on technical lyceen."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in the Humanitarian Survey revealed that nearly seven out of ten French (69%) criticise the state project of abolishing compulsory teaching in history and geography in the Terminale S (12th year of school with a scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also complained about this project, as well as the Left and some representatives of the Right.
The Minister replied that there was no question of limiting the philosophy of the S Terminals programme.
Luc Chatel also defended the educational reform for teachers, while 16 organisations (students and trade unions) had called for a protest against the project for Tuesday, which, in their opinion, is the victim of the pedagogical training of future teachers.
The Minister explained that they were undergoing a professional qualification examination in Master 2 (M2) at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year they were subject to an approval examination examining their teaching skills.
In addition, they do internships during the year in the M2 and then teach one year before the students as teachers in the internship.
He continued: "If you add all the internships offered before the performance test, you can reach even more hours you spent before the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
The Minister finally stated that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a "sache that does not exist in popular education."
He reaffirmed that he wanted to cancel the school card until 2012.
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the stake at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice President of the "Ingovernmental Panel on Climate Change", had to deal with on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in the Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As one AFP journalist observed, the Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first "Ernest" conference, in which experts turn to the audience every fifteen minutes with filmed contributions.
One would like to do something to reach people and in them the feeling of wanting to learn more, explained Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of this day, on the edge of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the names that the students gave to the fishers in the pool of the school.
"The experts selected around twenty participants, including after their charisma," he explained.
"You can talk for hours for climate warming, but the core targets can also be presented in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, who spoke with the help of films only before about 50 people.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he stressed in the hope that the audience might conclude that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos shot by these conferences will be available online from 15 December on the school page.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months.
Late payment : angry prison guards, actions planned
Trade unions of law enforcement officials have called on Friday for a general day of action in order to ensure that premiums and overtime payments, which have been postponed for budget reasons until January, are transferred before Christmas holidays.
The 2nd Trade Union of Criminal Officers ("FO-Pénitentiaire"), called on the employees who do not have any service to demonstrate and block the demonstrations in front of the Penalty on Tuesday morning, in order to draw attention to the "theft of what they have".
The 3rd Trade Union of Criminal Officers ('CGT-Pénitentiaire') called for 'to join in a strong mobilization in the various prisons' to which the non-payment of overtime, night-time bonuses, and the Sunday and holiday supplements in December are burned as 'bad and unacceptable' market.
The first union of law enforcement officers, the Autonomous Federal Criminal Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilizations (...) to show dissatisfaction and anger."
The management of the Penal Code and the Ministry of Justice stated that the overtime had increased sharply in 2009 and not all of them in the budget. However, they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice announced in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the law enforcement agencies guaranteeing that the payment was made in the next month.
"I know very well about the staff's efforts to keep our criminal justice system operational and modernise", the Minister of Justice said in this letter.
"I have ordered the management of the criminal justice agency to take immediate action to avoid such a situation, which has arisen from the lack of assessment of overtime, not repeating itself in the future," added Mrs Alliot-Marie.
The December wage is therefore lower, except for the management staff who benefit from high service and target premiums, the UFAP/UNSA explains for which the "household constraints" must be maintained.
"This is an absolute scandal," says the interregional union FO in Marseilles, announcing that "all assemblies and convocations" should be boycotted to new instructions.
"The staff does not go to work on Sundays and holidays if the hours of October in December are still not paid. This also applies to their overtime," says the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
"In a time when more and more tasks are being carried out to us without more staff being recruited, the attempt to enrich the staff's funds is more than inappropriate," says the CGT Union of Bordeaux.
According to trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions. Some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong to state the Secretary-General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget.
Obama believes that he always gives Christmas better gifts than he gets himself.
The American president, Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas with his family in the White House for the first time, has boasted at the TV-Talkmaster Oprah Winfrey that he is getting better and better gifts than he is getting himself.
On a special program broadcast over the ABC channel on Sunday evening, the president and his wife Michelle gave an insight into how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be with the party.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo," says Michelle Obama, adding that the dog will of course also receive a gift.
Michelle Obama rejected her husband's claims about the quality of gifts. "I made you beautiful gifts last year," she necks the president.
"So please," he swore to her, pointing to the pearl chain of the First Lady: "And who gave you this?"
During this one hour broadcast in an unforced atmosphere with the well-known television hostess Barack Obama had supported so vehemently during his election campaign, the president and his wife also talked about gifts that they had loved most as a child.
Barack Obama reminded himself of a bicycle with ten courses and also of a basketball that his father, whom he rarely saw, had brought with him at Christmas from Kenya.
"I remember when my father once visited us at Christmas and brought me a basketball," said the president.
"For the first time in my life, I understood that I had this ball from him."
The First Lady remembered her doll house.
"I didn't know how to arrange the furniture in a house at all, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace. But I loved this little doll house," said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday operated again, RTL confirms that he was transferred to the artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was again operated in Los Angeles due to significant "damage" after an operation in France. According to the people surrounding him, the situation was "under control", although RTL confirms that the singer was put into the artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was re-operated at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Wednesday to Thursday, after the American doctors found "damages due to the operation of a disc attack which he had suffered on 26 November in Paris, so his production company in Paris added that these injuries would have required a further operation.
The production company of the singer nevertheless wanted to clarify that the situation was "under control" and informed that a new medical opinion would be available in 48 hours at the latest.
However, according to RTL, the partner during the last tour of the singer, Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
However, it was only after 48 hours that one had a little more certainty about the patient’s condition as he opened his eyes that RTL added.
At the request of the AFP there was neither a confirmation nor a comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "from certain sources" indicates that after its first operation in Paris, "no-neighbourhood drainage" was laid.
The Rocker had been operated in the international clinic of Parc Monceau because of a disc attack.
The surgery planned over several days was done by Stéphane Delajux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available on Thursday evening for comments against RTL.
After Johnny Hallyday's surgery, the singer was admitted to Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for a follow-up infection after surgery.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, took the view from RTL on Thursday that his friend was just passing through a "deep valley". However, he assured that he needed "no worries" to make the rock musician, since he was "a good fighter".
"He had called me before he left for Los Angeles. I told him it was stupid to put himself in a plane for 12 hours after such an operation, which didn't go that way," said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer’s producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday “reacts well to antibiotics” and that “infected” is “infested”.
Mr Camus also said that he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and he did not feel any particular concern about it.
Nevertheless, the health care of the singer had grown ever greater since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after he had crashed on his yacht.
Two months later, it was to the general amazement that Johnny Hallyday had a "small intestinal cancer-OP" which led to a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer recorded his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been commented extensively. Fans and journalists have not escaped from the fact that the singer on stage had difficulty moving.
In the middle of November, the persons surrounding him had to dement a new delivery to the hospital.
Euro-2009/Kurzbahn: First place for Bousquet via its favourite distance
On Thursday, Frédérick Bousquet, a triple medal winner at the 2009 World Swimming Championships, took up an international title about his favourite distance, 50m freestyle, at the Euro-2009 on the short course in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, the last time polyurethane suits were allowed, there were only three world records, while a real record flood was expected.
One record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50m locations of the men.
Damage to Bousquet, who wanted to take the 50m freestyle after the world record, whose record he holds in the big basin (20.94).
At one of the two royal distances in swimming, 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman claimed in 20.53 sec. in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually eight) - a premiere at international level.
Bousquet forced the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can believe in ever greater things and in this case I said, if the world record is within my reach, I will try it."
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane sutures, which are prohibited from 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epic in Istanbul, which began in 1999 in the same competition for the first time.
The use of the combination did not pay off for the German Paul Biedermann, twice world champion in the basin this summer in Rome and world record at the end.
The young swimmer has not managed to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), yet with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Dane Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
"I didn't give everything this time.
I knew I couldn't get a world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my mission."
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," said Biedermann.
USA : Tomb plate estimated at Zola to $1.5 million
A Roman tomb plate, which appeared with the French writer Emile Zola, was estimated to be USD 1.5 million above its value on Thursday, according to the art dealer Sotheby's.
This record is two meters long and 63 cm high. It dates from the third century after Christ and has always been rated at 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The marble, on which "four scenes of the Dionysos are represented in a sophisticated architecture decor surrounded by satyrs and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," said Florent Heintz, vice president of the auction of Roman and Egyptian antiques at Sotheby's, compared to the AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold in hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still ongoing, but this part is certainly what the buyers have so far offered," says Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy against the AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of the marble part by Emile Zola goes far back.
The record was in Rome for nearly 300 years in the famous collection of the Borghese family at home, after which she appeared piece by piece at the French actress Cécile Sorel, who was used in her bathroom of her Paris hotel and at Paul Reynaud, Minister of the Third French Republic and President of the Council before Marshal Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
When searching the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this record was part of a "Emile Zola's legacy", which was opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of the Thérèse Raquin and the Fresko "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya's escape attempt from Honduras towards Mexico has been thwarted
On Thursday Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of the overthrown Honduran president Manuel Zelaya to be no longer compatible after this leadership had refused by the coup government as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya that took place at night, everything seems to indicate that there is disagreement about the possibilities of this transfer, the Mexican minister for foreign affairs, Patricia Espinosa, said.
According to the Immigration Authority, the aircraft submitted by the Mexican Government, which had arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of transferring M. Zelayas, had returned to its starting point.
The coup government wanted to require M. Zelaya to "debate" and for him abroad to seek political asylum under leadership.
The President-in-Office refused, however, since he wished to return to Mexico as the most welcoming, official head of state.
The coup regime "has suffered a further failure by moving me to give up on my costs (...), they wanted me to resign," said on Thursday M. Zelaya to Radio Globo, in which he has often spoken since the beginning of the political crisis, which lasts for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here well and like ten years, here I have my guitar, added the overthrown president, who had fled to the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, under attack of some accords.
The Mexican Embassy sent us a request for guidance, but unfortunately we cannot accept it, as it does not contain a request for asylum, on Wednesday Oscar Raul Matute, Interior Minister of the Putsch government, declared to the Honduran Radio HRN.
I do not seek asylum in any country at all, Manuel Zelaya had responded in an interview with the channel Telesur, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible exit from Honduras, so he had underlined, would only be made as president of the Honduran people.
The rumors of an exodus of M. Zelayas had mobilized on Wednesday the supporters of the overthrown president, who had taken up the Brazilian embassy and gathered around it, thereby strengthening the military's efforts there.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the coup government.
This, according to his assessment, revealed the marginal nature of this government in the light of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached the socialist Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on 28 June, on the day of the popular survey organised by him to prepare his re-election, contrary to the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
His exile in Costa Rica surprised him to return on September 21 and had fled to the Brazilian Embassy.
If he leaves this, he will be detained for high treason, where he is accused by the judiciary, says the coup government.
The Putsch President, Roberto Micheletti, was able to organise a presidential election on November 29th to replace Mr Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States in the course of the controversial election, but was rejected by the Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argeninia or Brazil.
Three days later, the Kogress had voted massively against M. Zelaya's return to office until the end of his term of office on 27 January.
Wall Street in the upturn, the trade balance of the USA nourishes optimism
The New York Stock Exchange concluded with a high on Thursday, the figures of the American trade balance show a price recovery of the United States' shares and their partners: the Dow Jones has added 0.67 %, the Nasdaq by 0.33 %.
According to the stock market closure figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen from 68.78 points to 10,405,83 points, the Nasdaq, which is dominated by technology, from 7,13 points to 2,190,06 points.
The expanded index Standard & Poor's 500 was written with 0.58% (6.40 points) on 1.102.35 points.
There are good news from various branches, judged Lindsey Piegza by FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotal under the premise that the market focuses only on "half-way glasses", so it subdued.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are mainly focused on the figures of the US trade balance, "which shows an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The United States' trade deficit fell by 7.6% to $32.9 billion in October compared with September.
In contrast, the analysts had calculated a defitzuwach.
Imports as well as exports have increased.
The big news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in goods exports, which reflects the economic growth of the main trading partners of the United States, Christopher Cornell commented on from business research Economy.com.
In return, the news of unemployment in the United States has risen against all expectations in the last week and has now reached the level of 474,000 requests.
However, during the last four weeks, the average value of new jobseekers "fell to the low point of the year", said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The profitability of government bonds to 10 years has increased to 3.482 % compared to 3.432 % on Tuesday evening, the profitability of bonds to 30 years to 4.492 % on 4.408 % on the previous evening.
Cuba: Hundreds of guerrillas standing in power whistle out "Damen in White"
Some hundreds of guerrillas who stand at the Cuban power on Thursday gave up the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the purpose of the World Human Rights Day and also destroyed another rally, due to which a good dozen dissidents were temporarily arrested.
To the forty "Damen in Weiss", spouses or nearby political prisoners, on the open road of partisans of the government were poured out under Raul Castro, just as they were at the foot of the march to the center of the capital to demand the liberation of political prisoners, an AFP journalist confirmed.
Down with the Yankies!, "Söldner!", "The road belongs to the revolutionaries!", "It lives Fidel and Raul!", the authorized partisans with raised fist scolded dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who had appeared to "ensure their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "Damen in Weiss" had taken place on the eve of the night in Havana, where neither injured nor arrested had occurred.
On the other hand, in the Havanna Vedado district, a dozen dissidents were temporarily arrested by civilian police, who also took up the demonstration held on Thursday in the face of the International Human Rights Day, and confirmed a reporter from the AFP.
According to this journalist, the government-based dissidents have forced them to enter civil vehicles under force.
The temporary detention of dissidents in such circumstances is usually limited to only a few hours.
As candidates at the Sakharov Prizes awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the Women in Weiss organised an unapproved march for the purpose of "Please for the Release of All Political Prisoners", the number of whom, according to the dissident list, is about 200 people, said Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda is detaining a 20-year prison sentence.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of the 75 Cuban dissidents detained in March 2003, of whom 53 are sitting behind bars until March 2003.
The Cuban authorities feel that the opponents of the regime are "soldiers" or "agents" in the service of the declared enemy, the United States.
A rarity in itself is that Cuban television reported on the demonstration events held on Thursday between militant pro-government fighters and "counter-revolutionary".
Cuba, led by a Party of Unity, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of compromising rights and freedoms, in particular of freedom of expression.
Crazy killer kills eighty-years with the knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
On Friday against late afternoon, at the main business time in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) an armed madman killed an eighty-year-old and injured five more people.
According to the first information of the survey, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the eighty-year-old from unexplained cause in or before a pharmacy on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knives and this, according to police records, with the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, was reported to be responsible for the police syndicate Alliance in the hospital for the consequences of his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he has pre-buttoned a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in the triplets, was attacked and injured.
The first two victims were seriously injured in hospital, where the eighty-year-old died.
The other injured person is in danger of life, as he, according to police sources, apparently affected vital organs.
The pregnant woman has become sick as a result of the events and is said to have been hospitalized in the "shock state" of a police source.
The armed man, who seemed to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs according to police records, should immediately have left the street, the same boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have injured two other passers-by, apparently by accident: a thirty-year-old and a forty-year-old, while the latter of the two heavy.
The scenario stayed in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two carnivorous knives, which he carried crossed behind his back, explained on site Arnaud Pressé, a responsible syndicated alliance of the Hauts-de-Seine area.
Several passers-by, including young people, should have tried, according to the AFP’s reports, to keep the mad.
I saw a guy in the threesomes with a green vest.
Three young people tried to get involved.
They couldn't do it because the guy was well built, reported Alberto, a waiter of a nearby bar.
A horde fell over him, he added, including a city police officer who broke his wrist.
Two city police officers, including their supervisor, were still trying to arrest the armed man and were injured with knife stings, such as police records.
The event took place in one of Clichy-la-Garenne's main ramparts, where there are a number of shops.
Passersby have come to me to inform me that there is an injured person out there.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the ground, I put her in first aid station and noticed a clumsy wound in the stomach area, told Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person, about thirty years old, was injured by cuts.
The police force finally arrested the man who was not carrying ID cards.
Nanterre's Public Prosecutor's Office has commissioned the District Bureau of the Criminal Police of Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92) to investigate the case.
The madman was hospitalized on Thursday night.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police source doesn't rule out that he's being delivered to a mental institution.
According to another police source, there were six officers humiliating him at the Clichy Police Commissariat, where he had been taken.
He was "in a state of exasperation" like "all the mentally confused of this kind, in which the forces release themselves during the tattering."
USA: Polish lawyer calls for re-introduction of the prosecution
The lawyer of French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has demanded, for a number of times on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States), to have the prosecution against his clients, who are currently in court at his place of residence in Switzerland due to a breach of morality more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the director of the "Pianist", has brought serious procedural errors to trial in 1977 before three judges of the Court of Appeal in the second district of California.
I demand criminal prosecution on the spot, M. Hummel explained before adding that the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at the time of the trial, Laurence Riddenband, "was a cold run down the back".
According to him, the judge, who has now died, discussed the Rittenband with an prosecutor who is supposed to have told him that Roman Polanski deserves a breeding house -- which represents a serious procedural error.
This discussion was thrown up in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and deserted" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and coveted), especially by attorney David Wells.
M. Wells had finally declared at the end of September that the authors of the documentary film were "consecrated".
If the Court refuses to terminate the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel demands the conduct of a process which would enable him to present the evidence for his arguments.
On the other hand, the charge has repeated the evidence already presented in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the removal of the facts charged to the defendant cannot be seriously considered as long as Roman Polanski does not appear in court.
The 76-year-old director had fled the United States in 1978, even before proclaiming the level of punishment for "illegal sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years.
He hasn't travelled to the United States since then.
The deputy prosecutor of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, had declared that Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the trial".
If you want to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, who is an escape option? ask Mrs. Asayma.
In her opinion, "the filmmaker asks the Court for a favor and therefore despises its authority".
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to make their decision known, even pointed out that "there are other alternatives to escape".
Hummel was not the only one who had applied for the arrest of Roman Polanski.
The attorney of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also demanded the lifting of criminal proceedings.
She recalled that her client would no longer bear to be harassed by any resuscitation of the Affaire Polanski and added: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was just.
Thirty-two years are enough".
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on 26 September at the request of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was then sentenced to a house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad, expecting a possible extradition.
Wall Street is slowed down by the rise of the dollar and shuts down without course.
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Friday without a price in a market between better indicators than planned in the US and an increase in the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
On the basis of the final figures available at closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased by 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the technically dominated Nasdaq has given 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The expanded index Standard & Poor's 500 has risen by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
"Really, the market is quite quiet," Mace found viewing silver from Marblehead Asset Management.
"It remains strictly limited, the volume of trade has become very low and I think this will remain so until the end of the year."
The trend has been supported by the publication of better economic indicators than planned, which "have contributed to improving the market view to the soundness of the recovery of the economy", the analysts of Charles Schwab summarized.
In the US, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, thus two consecutive months and far more than planned.
Furthermore, American consumers' confidence improved significantly in December to 73.4 compared to 67.5 in the previous month, according to the index preview of the University of Michigan.
However, the indices have been slowed down by a new increase in the dollar rate, which has reached the highest level in two months from the euro, which means that 'the sectors facing the economic situation are being pushed down', said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
As a result, technological values have lost something on the ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The return on the treasury bond over 10 years increased by 3.540% on Wednesday evening compared with 3.482% and that of the bond over 30 years to 4.497% compared to 4.492% of the previous day.
Election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of tour through South Africa, the 112 candidates for Miss World's title on Saturday will exceed the last hurdle in order to realize their dream: to be elected to the most beautiful woman in the world and to watch this before a billion TVs.
During this great beauty fair, which will be held for the second time in a row in the area of Johannesburg, five of them have already got their ticket to the semifinals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were awarded Miss Sportive or Miss Topmodel during their African stay.
This was a true murmur of pleasures.
Beautiful cities to visit, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Hoorn, were just extraordinary.
I have seen many things and made a lot of experiences!, said Miss Sierra Leone with full enthusiasm.
This competition takes place nine times in South Africa and is broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 5 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturday.
I couldn't imagine a better country to hand over my crown.
This experience was just fascinating.
I am happy to have made this experience twice, underlined Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the rediscovery of "breathtaking landscapes".
After a month of Galas, rehearsals, encounters with the press and Safari, the Miss is now concentrating on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to step into the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present in this election, as well as after Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and were both Bollywood stars.
Of course, it is the dream of every woman to be crowned once as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it is not just about appearance here.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India throws in with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition will be underlined with music and dance.
The candidates defil in traditional costumes and not to be forgotten in the swim suit.
The performance is presented by a television host, the Chinese Angela Chow, by the ex-beautiful Queen from South Africa, Michelle McLean and by a director of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it is the world to receive with an almost overwhelming cordiality and pride, assures Julia Morley, president of the Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, made a safari, visited the famous township in Soweto, but this time they cost the bike and the local cuisine.
However, the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them the hand, was quite exceptional.
Not usually for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Her most beautiful memory, however, remains the exclamation in Cape Town (Southwest) for the World Football Championship in June 2010, a kind of country to advertise for this event a little more.
I'm wrong with people I could probably never get closer to.
I will certainly return to the 2010 World Cup, promising Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news to Johnny Hallyday according to his son David is "very positive"
The news to Johnny Hallyday is "very positive", assured his son David on Friday on his arrival at Los Angeles airport, where he visited his father, who has been in the hospital for a few days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, David Hallyday told the press when he left the plane, in which he arrived from Paris shortly after 13 o'clock local time (21 o'clock ME).
The son of the singer, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would "fastest" go to Cedars-Sinaï Hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was delivered on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection following an operation on a disc attack in Paris on November 26th.
The singer was "moved this night in Los Angeles into an artificial coma to relieve his severe pain and be able to perform his treatment, the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was transferred by the doctors at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles to an artificial coma, in which he was delivered on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection after a disc surgery on November 26th in Paris.
The singer had to undergo an operation again during the night from Wednesday to Thursday because of the sick changes caused by the last operation.
His wife Laeticia attended a school event in Los Angeles, France, on Friday morning, in which her daughter Jade went to school, a photographer of the AFP noted.
The head of the department of orthopedic and traumatic surgery at the Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday at the hospital in Los Angeles.
The producer has severely strained the neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated on 26 November in the Clinique international du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told that he had done the purest massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said that they were completely disgusted, explained Mr. Camus.
I've heard that you might start a trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "has travelled far too fast and this with the permission of the Parisian surgeon to Los Angeles".
I phoned this doctor personally, who assured me that he saw this trip as completely unproblematic, which surprised me very much, since I already had two disc operations behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he announced to RTL that the singer apparently had left the hospital after the operation "without Drainage, without Everything".
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the artist environment.
He had the actress Marie Trintignant, who operated a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he practiced at that time.
In 2007 he had also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a hematoma after brain bleeding.
However, he is also a doctor with dubious reputation, who has been sentenced several times due to failed operations and not to forget, because of tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, a doctor's chamber attorney, called him "a man without a scruple", who has to be "regularly" in charge of the board and is "everything other than recommendable".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made an explanation about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi, on Friday.
This said the intervention would have been "perfect" and the post-operative investigations would have been "normal".
The operation "did not induce bleeding and therefore does not require drainage", he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been apparent since the last summer, seems to be in question.
It is obvious that it is too close for a continuation of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens), said Mr Camus.
The UDF Party Alliance (Union for French Democracy) becomes energetic and urges the Nouveau Centre Party to stop using its seal
On Friday, the alliance of parties supervised by François Bayrou's MoDem Party strongly reacted to a takeover attempt by the Siegel, which was once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, on the part of the chairman of the Nouveau Centre Party, Hervé Morin, and urged him, under threat of judicial persecution, not to use this seal on any more document.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal because he believes that François Bayrou would not be worthy of defending this political heritage after he had handed over the hand of the left.
By the way, the Minister of Defence, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to reaffirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
In order to reflect his efforts, he had received the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (former UMP, now at NC) who claimed ownership of the UDF brand, as he first applied for this brand in 2004 at the Institut national de la propriété industriale.
However, the UDF party alliance, supervised by François Bayrous' friends, broke the silence and clearly indicated that they could not escape and set a deadline for the Minister and the MEP to stop using this seal and to transfer the trademark's property rights to them.
In recent days, you have made numerous explanations that you would propose to your political movement to accept the UDF seal to + take over+, the party alliance wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem Party and Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centrist Alliance.
You probably also believed you had the right to have the name of this movement +Nouveau centre+, the slogan + of today's UDF+ printed on their political material as well as on the home page of your website.
As you know, you do not have the right to use this seal, declared the UDF headquarters and asks the party NC to "delete the mention of the name UDF from all material as well as from (their) website".
In addition, Hervé de Charette "required that the trademark's property rights be transferred to its legal rightholders".
If you refuse to do so, we will sue you to respect the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they stress that "UDF has been a full political movement since 1978 and reminds us that Morin and his friends have "made the choice" to leave 2007 to establish a competing movement, as others had already done in 2002 to establish the party "UMP".
The party Nouveau centre therefore has no right, according to the signatory, to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie française).
They continue to recall that the last Congress of the UDF in 2007 adopted the three-year accession to the MoDem Party as well as the establishment of an office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charette is concerned, the office continues, "at the time when he applied for the brand name, he has been no longer a member of the UDF for three years" but the UMP.
He benefits in a scandalous and fraudulent way, from the lack of deposit of the acronym UDF, to carry this out for himself.
Furthermore, you give thought to the fact that this carelessness is the best way to turn into a crime, and iron the NC strategy: "It seems to us in politics as well as in life more dignified to make a name for oneself instead of trying to get out of anonymity by making a name, fraudulently, in which you have no legal claims."
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier is convicted of exploiting weakness
On Friday, the Court of Nanterre decided to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he has taken advantage of a weak moment of the eighty-years in order to hide some of her property.
The 62-year-old photographer, who is known for his star photos, will have to answer to court on 15 and 16 April 2010 for exploiting weaknesses, a crime handed down with a maximum term of three years and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that in fact there will be a process in this affair worthy of the saga of one of France's richest families, in which mother and daughter grapple and at the same time have the reins of the cosmetics empire L'Oréal in hand.
However, the 15th Penitentiary also arranged a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bedtencourt, which is conducted jointly by three doctors.
L'Oréal's heir and principal shareholder has so far refused to undertake such an investigation, especially not under the conditions laid down in the investigation by Nanterre's prosecution.
The doctors appointed on Friday are due to present a report before 10 March 2010 in which you clearly indicate whether and at what times Liliane Bettencourt may have found itself in a state of weakness.
I think she's going to undergo these investigations.
I'm going to talk to her, explained the lawyer of Mrs. Bettencourt, Me Georges Kiejman, after the trial.
As for the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very pleased with the decision of the court.
This is an excellent news (...). The report will prove that he (Banier) manipulated this old lady that you have to protect, he confirmed.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has filed a criminal lawsuit against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of exploiting her mother's weaknesses for years in order to hide donations of a total of one billion euros in the form of bank checks, insurance policies or paintings.
On the other hand, Liliane Bettencourt had always objected to being manipulated by the photographer whom she sees as a long-standing friend.
Although the court had to verify the admissibility of the complaint initiated by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, the Plaidoyers of the attorneys led to a large family debacle on Friday.
The lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt has thus appealed to three letters sent by his client to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she mistrusted the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added the following: "Please explain to my daughter that I have written to Banier for fifteen years, once or twice a day.
Françoise has never been able to speak since her marriage."
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office once again considers that the plaintiff had no right to react in this way, especially because a guardian judge has rejected his request in recent days to initiate a judicial protection procedure against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, is not protected and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act in their place," confirmed the prosecutor, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court has now decided to give a judgment after the trial of the admissibility of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers has taken place.
Manager Revolution or the End of Strategic Early Enlightenment?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been in vain ...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies regarding its employees, said the position of consumers vis-à-vis the marketing revolution: Joining the staff "Values" determines the best, as it was previously designed on consumer products by the technicians in the factory.
By focusing on the company, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in place ... although the authoritarian temptation products separate factors to impose customer preferences regularly again!
Demobilisation of employees can lead to a fatal demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the top of a much larger phenomenon, which particularly affects employees.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all the company's intellectual functions, especially those of R & D, which is even more decisive, on those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economy = Economic Intelligence) "requires of all the parties involved (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking approach";it claims from employees an effort that fully contradicts the instructions of authoritarian management.
That is why we are calling for an operational revolution, which would be to place employees in the middle of the company's concerns on a par with customers.
The very limited use of internal opinion polls
Will the internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its wage earners, stimulate this revolution with regard to management practices?
I'm afraid not.
- First of all, because I could see that in view of a new situation, the whole structure finally got along with many detours, first of all, doing what it has always done.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - grows proportionally to the importance of its own failure.
And finally, because most executives have a highly simplified idea of human behavior.
Previously from the major engineering schools, her interpretation of psychology is mechanical.
Through intellectual comfort, they adopt the old behavioral theory, which has recently been reactivated by the American "neosciences" and unknowingly widespread by research institutes and the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to engage the "Hebel" (sic) to the engagement of employees, a current Le Figaro.fr survey published by Ipsos strengthens the executives in a position to a mechanical control system that is unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors
Instead, a corporate revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern companies presupposes the adoption of a final view of human behaviour.
It consists of integrating a basic protocol in every reflection or practice of governance: for the wage earners, the commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means of fulfilling part of their dreams, ambition and projects.
At the moment only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take on this conception of the motivation of the employees.
These studies have shown that they judge their company on the basis of a specified doxa that allows them to estimate what it offers them to achieve their life goals through their perceived image of the company.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, the managers of the companies can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and reposition their human resource management at the right place.
They thus create a fertile soil that is favourable to the coordinated development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The talk of Oslo: the "right war" brings Obama praise from the right
On Friday, the American rights welcomed Barack Obama's speech in Oslo last night and were satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of "right war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who ridiculed the award to Obama on 9 October, applauded this time the President’s speech, the example of the former Vice-Presidentship candidate in the 2008 elections following Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin said, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the daily US Today, and added that she herself brought the theme of a "sometimes necessary" war into her memory published just now.
The war is, of course, the last thing I think Americans want to do, but it's necessary.
We need to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who has inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, has tried on Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force; one way to explain his decision of nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, took the view that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, pleased the former president of the House of Representatives, who especially acknowledged the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obama.
In some parts, Ginrich, who was surveyed in the radio broadcast "The Takeaway", felt that this speech was historic.
The previous Member, who is considered by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said that he was pleased to have seen a "president of the left" who reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that they "could not be free and could not hand out a prize for peace if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor of the Washington Post, Obama has held "a very American speech".
In addition to being "cosmopolitan," as "he always does," he spoke "like an American president," when he pointed out that Europeans "live like in a safety bubble that they did not create themselves and do not do much for their protection," says Gerson.
Among the few unconvinced rights, former UN ambassador John Bolton, a falcon of the era Bush, described the speech on the website of the National Review Online as "long, high-end and uninspired".
On the left of the President, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends the withdrawal of the armed forces.
If you pack up the war under the cover of justice, the massacre can easily be justified to the innocent, he warns.
However, the press of the moderated left remains praiseworthy on the side of the president.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that the Nobel Prize was prematurely awarded to Obama, called the speech itself for a speaker like him who is known for his talent as "monumental work".
The Oslo speech "produces a timetable for managing international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression," says California’s daily newspaper.
The New York Times believes that Obama "declared the necessary discourse" and calls his speech "dark and exemplary at the same time".
Remote drivers: Three marathons for an agreement that secures the supply for Christmas
After a three-week negotiating marathon, the trade unions of the street association and the TLF - the only employer organisation that remained until the end - came to an agreement on Friday evening that puts an end to the strike command and the threatening heavy supply engulfment at Christmas.
At the signature meeting on Friday evening, the State Secretary responsible for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, welcomed the agreement, which was opened on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiation, the negotiators separated on the early Friday morning in the hope of signing the agreement quickly in the late morning.
Although the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, more than six hours passed from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 a.m. until the conclusion of the agreement and only at 18:00 a.m. was the agreement signed.
The conflict "had done a lot of damage to the companies" and "it was too afraid that he would affect the holidays at the end of the year," says Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a 4% wage increase for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for employees with the lowest wages thus increases from €8.72 to €9.06.
"This is not very much, but we start small first," said Patrice Clos (FO).
The activists are now forced to stop blocking the supply centres.
"However, there will probably always be some people who are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
TLF Chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although it was "hard to admit these wage increases in the face of international competition".
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on the common sense and respect for the employees," says Maxime Dumont (CFDT), whereas Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) spoke about "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also foresees an increase of 3% in travel costs and a maintenance of the total budget for road transport in the first half of 2010, which will in particular allow the issue of 13th month salary and the modernisation of collective agreements.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "the drop in employers' contributions of EUR 100 million" was the subject of an amendment to the Government's 2009 Bill on Adjusted Finances, which was adopted by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government calls for "an identical" vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to apply initially to the companies affiliated to that organisation and thereafter to apply to the entire profession in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
This will be the case "in the shortest time", says Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' associations can only delay the procedure.
The FNTR association ordered a "fraud trade" because the EUR 100 million "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for some of the carbon taxes".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a common analysis, but in order not to wipe out the goose eaters on the approaching Christmas days, the Unostra complains.
For the Otre association, the agreement threatens to "shut the small and medium-sized companies in the industry over the next 12 months a large grave".
Line RER A: Disasters this weekend, trade unions dissatisfied with the proposals of the RATP
The disruptions on the RER A line, the largest high-speed rail network in France for the Paris metropolitan area and the Île-de-France, continued at the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the 2nd strike day between the unions and the management of the RATP (independent Paris passenger transport administration) continued to keep strikers waiting with their demands for wage increases.
At this important shopping weekend before Christmas there were no trains running between 10:00 and 20:00. On the central line (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains and outside the central line was ready to use only one of four trains.
The connection to the trains of the SNCF was interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture, which forced travellers to change.
The department store chain Galeries Lafayette, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is trying to connect the large shops with traffic technology".
The line RER A runs through the Parisian conurbation from west to east.
The route section of the RATP connects the towns of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one of two trains was scheduled for the main time of traffic, and almost none during the time of low traffic.
As already on Thursday, there was no manpower on the rails, as the residents of the Île-de-France had settled on the situation.
So early in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less overflowing than otherwise, especially because of the lack of high school enthusiasts.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), explained that he had "been raised one and a half hours earlier to get to work on time".
The SNCF, which had planned to provide assistance to passengers by staff and officers, pointed out that there had been no shortages at the Saint-Lazare station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on line RER A or towards Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or drove through Saint-Lazare station to ensure the connection to the metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, general meetings of the strikers took place again, during which the results were reviewed, which the associations had classified as "difficult" after the meeting with the leader on Friday afternoon.
The RER managing director proposed the specific drafting of a protocol for line RER A with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, careers, etc.
However, this is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud), they demand a long-term wage supplement.
The CGT was indignant that the RATP itself put its wage proposals in brackets and stressed that the leadership "is unable to solve a problem, but this was possible for the distance drivers and the SNCF."
RATP made it clear that a new meeting was planned for the "overall examination of working conditions" for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company "ignores the weekend drivers".
In the morning about 150 riders went to the establishment of a Paris Committee.
Once again it was the leader who so far refused any discussion during the strike and suggested a meeting after a calming of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to expand on the RER B line following a pre-announcement of Unsa and Indépendants.
The associations demand a wage supplement of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants). In addition, they complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this route, on which millions of travellers travel daily.
The riders of the RER line, who have years of professional experience, will receive a gross wage of 2,200 to 2,700 Euros and a wage supplement of 600 to 650 Euros for shift services, as well as Sundays and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court announced the dissolution of the pro-Kurdish main party of the country; a decision following the immediate angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul followed.
This decision threatens to make the work of the government enormously difficult, which is trying to reach the hands of the Kurdish community in order to put an end to the conflict that has been taking place for 25 years.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) has been dissolved as it has become a "place for action which is detrimental to the independence of the State and its indivisible unity," said the President of the Constitutional Court of Hasim Kiliç four days after the decision to the press.
According to Kiliç, the decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to impose the resolution. He also pointed out that 37 of the party’s executives, including Ahmet Türk and the parliamentarian Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from political affairs for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity, which Turkish and Tugluk enjoy, as well as the confiscation of the party's property.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
The party leaders expressed themselves before the verdict that the parliamentarians would prefer to leave the Parliament rather than meet non-party parliamentarians.
The decision followed a procedure initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Turkish Federal Court of Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya. He accused the DTP of following the "weisungen" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is considered by Ankara and many other countries to be terrorist organisations.
Numerous observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has "no connection" to the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate.
The ruling of the Constitutional Court works between the Government, which seeks to counter the Kurdish community and to propose a series of measures to strengthen the Kurds' rights in order to ensure that the PKK is supported by the Kurds and to put an end to conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP confirm that resolution could lead to a recurrence of tensions in South-East Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the detention conditions of the PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan in recent weeks had led to a conflict with the police.
Since the announcement of the court, thousands of protesters have gathered in front of the premises of the DTP in the million city of Diyarbakir in the southeast, populated mostly by Kurds.
The officers used tear gas grenades and water throwers when the demonstrators began to throw Molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Türk assumed that the court's decision "will deepen despair even further".
"Turkish cannot resolve this question (Kurdish, Noted) on the basis of the prohibition of a party," he explained to the press.
The government, consisting of a party derived from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
"We are opposed to the closure of the parties by principle.
This does not solve the problems," said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedo of democratic opening promoted by the government," said political market observer Ahmet Island.
"You can obviously look at a reaction of the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK announced a strike three days earlier, killing seven soldiers in the north of Turkey. This was one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The snow break may come
A really crisp winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass the citizens, says the winter service manager of the FES.
Especially so that his employees can test and master the entire vehicle technology.
In the weekend, according to meteorologists, it could be that far for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are available to take care of snow and ice.
The FES proceed according to a precise plan.
As soon as it snows wide in Frankfurt and temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-streets are driven off with large-scale drifters, explains Brauburger.
These include major roads such as the New Road and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire services, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and routes with falls, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The service of the FES starts at three o'clock in the morning
The approximately 1040 kilometers would have to be scattered within a maximum of three hours with moisture salt, which is better attached, if required.
That's why the FES starts at three o'clock at night, "so that the routes are free until professional traffic starts".
It will be difficult if it snows only at 7.30 a.m.
Then we have a problem, says the Winter Service Manager, "because then nobody is willing to put the scattering vehicles in place".
Only after that, if it does not continue to snow, are supply and development roads, including the Rat-Beil-Straße, on the line.
The last priority is side and side roads.
There will be complaints, knows Brauburger.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES's foot population is on the way, danger points and transitions are cleared priority.
In most cases, the FES could not take care of all cycle routes.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that keeps an eye on the bridges from 22 to 4.30, says Brauburger.
As it gives on this quick smooth, as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees, the scatter is on the move.
If necessary, this is also called by the police.
The Coat of the Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: The two-metre-long and 1.50-meter-sized animal ran on two strong hind legs, had a long skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle collars and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would be nothing special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the journal Science of Thursday.
The animal lived some 215 million years ago in today’s New Mexico, which was on the equator in a dry zone of the supercontinent of Pangea.
Tawa opens a new window on the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us much about the relationship, spread and characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other palaeontologists began digging on the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones one day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the trias, reports team member Randall Irmis from the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as new species.
During the excavation they combined the remains of a total of five individuals.
Fund confirms theories on Dino Early History
The name "Tawa" is derived from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an extraordinary find: "Dinosaur fossils from the trias are extremely rare, usually you only find individual fragments."
Other dinosaur experts don't necessarily share the enthusiasm.
Especially spectacular is this find not, but he confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
After the current teaching, the dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the assignment of these original dinos is usually controversial.
For example, the experts discuss when the lizards split into their three main lines of development: the carnivorous theropods, which later included the tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, which are known as "long-tails", the four-legged sauropods and their relatives, and the plants milling ornithicia (bird-basinsaurier), which included, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
After the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropode.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
At the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found evidence of air bags, as they also have the descendants of the Theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air bags, the respiration of the birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
At Tawa hallae also the bones of the spine were apparently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropode with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the huge sauropods later also had airbags and lightweight bones, probably the common ancestor of both groups had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, the researchers say that the lizards appeared there for the first time.
Thus, the three lines of development began to differ early and spread from South America to all parts of the earth, which at that time still formed a single land mass as a supercontinent Pangea.
The fact that the team, together with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related, Theropods, speaks for this.
The three cannot come from a common immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe that there were at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
There are, of course, contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says Bonner Palaeontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could result in a distorted picture, because in South America just a lot of primitive Dino fossils have been preserved, while on other continents nothing can be found.
As the dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare side line of the reptile strain to the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Middle Ages, it is still puzzling.
During the trias, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example, with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and the flying auraurs and with many more axes.
Towards the end of the trias, the dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while the relationship at the border from the trias to the Jura died out.
Success Story Not Lasting Forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass death that the dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so that they could beat the competition out of the field.
The success story certainly did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact of a group of animals turned into flowers, which had already developed in the Trias and since then had a shadowing age: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors at the University of Toronto depend on the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
There are teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police clearance of Frankfurt's Goethe University's occupied casinos beats waves around the world.
278 Professors and lecturers from Goethe University, but also from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, join forces with the protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, she "misapplied" her use of police by the Bureau.
Uni-President Werner Müller-Estler had let the building occupied by students and lecturers in the educational strike clear last week because walls and artworks had been mutilated.
Five students were injured.
The damage to property, the judges judge the signatories, did not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized courses of students and teachers by a police command".
The room represents a "non-acceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "the delegitimisation and criminalisation of the protest" and diverts from the content.
The Bureau withdrew from the necessary discussion.
The lecturers are calling for the immediate cessation of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the occupiers did not support the damage to property, it says.
Legitimated protest
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German Confederation of Trade Unions also join forces with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for the future, says Verdi-Landesjugendsekret Alexander Klein.
However, Hesse's minister of science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the conduct of Uni-President and the police.
We are grateful to the Uni-President.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in the Wiesbaden Landtag.
We understand the protest, but we do not understand Vandalism, according to the CDU member of the country Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, the opposition fractions saw SPD, Green and Left.
The CDU takes painted walls to the pretext of criminalising the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, one would have cleared up.
The left has submitted an application asking the Minister of the Interior to report on the police operation.
New Silicon Valley
For many years she was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a strictly guarded location for secret arms research.
Today, the municipality with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the Moscow centre, is considered to be "Russian Silicon Valley".
Significant research and production sites for micro and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograds had already made contacts with the Frankfurter Wissenschaftsstandort Riedberg - with the Uniinstituten and the companies of the Frankfurter Innovationszentrum (FIZ).
There were several visits and on Wednesday Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "protocol on closer cooperation".
The Moscow Vice Mayor Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, for which Frankfurt signed the planning secretary Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies are allowed to take foot on the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian science companies want to execute orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronic Engineering, the large companies Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist plan city" for arms research.
Selenograd (literally translated "Grünstadt") was named from the wooded hillside landscape in which the research institutions are embedded.
Stuttgarter Bramklotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
The promoters of the project are simply concerned with "the new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than the laying down of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project that will plunge the city of the Baden-Württemberg state capital into a hopeless building site chaos for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born out of the spirit of the 1980s.
Head stations with tracks that end in the middle of the city were then considered to be transport-technical fossils of the 19th century, which seemed like brake blocks of a modern rail traffic, since it once took a great deal of time to retrace locomotives from the back to the front.
Get in, keep up, keep going - that's how it's supposed to go.
And that's why the headquarters should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, located about half way from the trans-European rail magistrate between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - therefore the slogan of the "heart of Europe".
S21 is now actually being considered, although the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that it is almost impossible in the Hessian and Bavarian city to implement the laying down of the ground.
Head stations, however, no longer have an entry and exit problem, since there are modern turning trains with engines and trucks at both ends.
Nevertheless: Stuttgart 21 next to the ICE new construction line to Ulm is now under way.
It has been implemented by state and local politicians.
The railway is involved, also because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic of the Tax Payers and not in the state group are borne.
The project can still be justified to some extent by urban design.
It creates new urban space, which - it is believed to be the computer-generated graphics of the planners - is equipped with plenty of greenery.
S21 is harmful for the rail transport system.
The railway station and the extension of the route are intended for the passenger traffic, which is typically attributed to huge growth in the 1980s.
At that time there was not yet the competition of the cheap pilots.
However, modern transport policy must first be aimed at strengthening freight transport, as transport on the rail is much more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
But the new line is not suitable for freight trains due to heavy climbs.
Even more serious is the fact that S21 also indirectly acts on many other railway projects.
A good six billion euros are to be banned in the Swiss.
That's the official number.
Experts consider ten to 15 billion to be realistic.
In the next decade, the money will be missing at other nodes and bottlenecks in the net.
A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of the more than 180 km long route through the Rhine valley.
Since 1987, it has been built on the trasse in the pace of time.
It would be necessary to press the tube right here.
But S21 will act as a brake block.
The Rheintal line becomes a bottleneck for international freight transport: in the heart of Europe.
Government Tests Judgment on Airport
The state government has made it clear in the Wiesbaden Landtag whether it will review the judgment of the Hessische Verwaltungsgerichtshof (VGH) on the night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP coalition had commissioned experts to legalise the VGH ruling in more than 400 pages, said Minister of Economic Affairs Dieter Posch (FDP).
On this day, the VGH in Kassel had stated in writing that in the case of the construction of the planned North West Landebahn at Frankfurt Airport, the country had to reregulate the night flight ban.
The approval of 17 flights between 23 and 5 p.m., as the government foresees, is not compatible with the legal protection of the population against night noise.
The coalition will have to decide by 4 January whether it is going against the verdict in revision.
The opposition criticized this postponement and urged the representatives of the government to refrain from revising the Bundesverwaltungsgericht in Leipzig.
SPD-Fractionist Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel urged CDU and FDP to return to their pre-election promises for a night flight ban. Otherwise, this was to be seen as a "wort break".
It's fucking hard if you can keep your word, said Green Chief Tarek Al-Wazir in advocating the FDP election slogan "We're Keeping Words".
Minister Posch rejected the allegation of Schäfer-Gümbel, trying to get to her night flights with "Legal Tricks and Trickserei".
A precise legal examination would take time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "fast first impression".
Stefan Müller (FDP) said that we need a secure resolution.
As they represent the opposition, his group’s statements on the night flight ban had never been.
US banks pay back help
The crisis-stricken US major banks are stripping their state bonds.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America has paid back the aid from the Tarp Bank Rescue Fund, amounting to a total of 45 billion dollars (good 30 billion euros).
And the Citigroup also plans, according to a report from the US channel CNBC, to refund the state aid.
Thus, institutions want to remove the restrictions associated with the acceptance of the money – such as the restriction on the payment of manager bonuses and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had obtained some 19 billion dollars of fresh money from investors.
The rest of the sum took her out of her own checkout, which was well filled, among other things, by segment sales.
On Wednesday evening, bank manager Kenneth Lewis expressly thanked the American taxpayer: The money injection had helped over a very difficult time.
The money house had risen to the height of the financial crisis with the acquisition of the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup is also seeking to obtain money on the capital market to free itself from its liabilities to the State.
Already on Thursday, the US bank could announce an approximately 20 billion dollars increase in its capital, reported CNBC calling for circles.
A Citigroup speaker didn't want to speak.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already paid back their help.
Quick Choice
Then everything went faster than I thought.
Only two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors had pushed Nikolaus Brender out of office by the chief editor in charge, the station can present a successor.
Last night the panel wanted to vote on the staff.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF headquarters in Berlin, was a favourite.
However, there was no confirmation from the sender - official to prevent the procedure.
However, the role of ZDF-intendent Markus Schächter should also not be affected by this proposal at the Board of Directors.
Frey, chess candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 panel members.
The result of the vote was not yet fixed at the end of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter failed in the Board of Directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members spoke out for Brender, seven voted against him. Brender’s election was a hard defeat for Schachter, but one expected.
For the majority of the Union in the Board of Directors had already signaled weeks before the election that Brender would not want to confirm in office.
The opposition against the chief editor of the Hessen Prime Minister Roland Koch had been organized.
With the argument that Brender had lost the ZDF's news broadcasts on switch-on quotas, he declined another term of office of the highly respected editor.
Until shortly before the election there were therefore protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was swept.
Last time, even 35 state judges had mixed up in the debate, which considered the course of Koch's action to be unconstitutional.
It's useless.
Go to person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
After that he worked at Südwestfunk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey moved to the ZDF, initially to "heute-journal".
Afterwards stations: 1988 to 1990 personal editor; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and moderator of the "Morgenmagazin"; until 2001 Head of the ZDF Foreign Policy; since the head of the ZDF headquarters.
The Greens announced a constitutional complaint after the election of Brenders, who was still elected by the sector magazine Medium Magazin as the journalist of the year on Wednesday.
Koch's counterpart in the Board of Directors, the Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should change the ZDF State Agreement in such a way that the Chief of Staff's proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, a delegation of party politicians from the supervisory bodies of the ZDF also excluded Beck.
Brender's likely successor Peter Frey had recommended himself to the Board of Directors with a wise chess train - by harshly criticizing the panel immediately after the Brender election.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schachter was able to nominate him without loss of face for the post of the editor-in-chief as well as to elect the Board of Directors, without suspecting that a party candidate would be appointed to office.
In the party arithmetics, Frey is nevertheless attributed to the left liberals.
Study Disappeared
Partial success for the students: After one year of the educational strike, the country's ministers finally set out on Thursday: At a meeting of the Conference of Ministers of Education and Higher Education Rectors, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions for Bachelor and Master.
The students should be able to cope with their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the test burden: in principle, each study module should only be completed with a single examination.
The student's workload should also be reviewed and "a realistic and acceptable measure" guaranteed.
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of examination services between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries undertook to make common structural arrangements for Bachelor's and Master's programmes more flexible.
There should also be no different country regimes.
Fewer Tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, Minister of Culture and Uni-Rectors have spoken the winged word of better studyability in their mouths.
Now it was filled for the first time with a concrete content.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided to drastically reduce the number of examinations: "Each module usually completes with only one examination", it says in a 30-page paper that is intended to partially re-regulate the approval of courses.
With the "significant reduction of the audit burden", Reinhold Grimm, the Accreditation Council chairperson, stated that "failure development should be stopped which significantly affected studyability."
In addition, the "studyability" will be "the decisive criterion" in the future.
Modules such as content would be "tough to verify" whether "necessary interference of students in the choice of
He said that he would avoid events.
The students would have "an appeal to receive room for play, which enables and promotes own initiative".
The aim is to apply the rules for the admission of new courses, but also for the examination of existing ones.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years – which means, however, that it will take until 2015 until all courses have been reviewed.
Ten national accreditation agencies are responsible for this, subject to the Accreditation Council set up by the countries.
In October, the Ministers for Culture had called on the countries to "press" to influence agencies in such a way that the substance content is not too large and the testing regime is not too strict.
Universities and universities of higher education have already agreed with the Ministries of the Federal Republic of Germany on appropriate measures.
As the only country to date, Rhineland-Palatinate pledged additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
The aim of the money is primarily to establish tutoring programmes and to strengthen study counselling and audit offices and foreign institutes.
Land and universities want to spend 10 million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government intends to introduce a amendment to the Higher Education Act to Parliament.
After this, only one examination is required for the completion of a study model.
The aim is to make the design of the study more flexible, to ensure recognition of qualifications at other universities and to facilitate access to the master's degree.
By the end of next year, all the country's study programmes will be checked for their studyability.
On Thursday, the government and opposition had again fought about the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, however, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Executive Board of the Juso College Groups called for the formation of education policy to no longer take place "after closed doors" of the ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the educational strike, the students should now also talk about "a word" as a subject.
The future academics received support from the President of the University Rectors' Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermand: "We need the students' experience," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture with whom the HRC advised on a joint reform paper.
The trade union Education and Science (GEW) did not go far enough: it demands a legal claim that enabled each graduate to gain access to a further master's degree.
On the other hand, countries need to ensure that the current generation of Bachelor students will have sufficient Master's degree places with the best possible study conditions tomorrow, according to GEW CEO Andreas Keller.
There is a clear need for countries to employ more teachers.
However, the Ministers for Culture did not express themselves on the freer access to the Master.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Entering into Germany and out of it is pretty almost no control..." is the beginning line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, in which he addresses the arrival experience of a dissident who gained freedom but at the same time lost his language space.
Born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, Werner Söllner had first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's book publishing house before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary awards, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurt poetry lectures at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hessian Literature Forum in the Mouson Tower in Frankfurt.
Last Tuesday, during a conference in Munich, he arranged for a considerable out-of-literary appearance, which included "German literature in Romania in the mirror and mirror of her securitatacts".
Apparently, Söllner leaves Söllner with an explanation in which he was able to cooperate as IM for the Romanian secret service Securitate before Romanian writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of the present, Söllner received the German Language Prize in 1989.
The recruitment attempts had begun sneaking, first in 1971.
I am, closed Söllner, "so someone who has not resisted the intimidation attempts of the Securitate enough."
The poet Werner Söllner is in Walter.
At the same time as the Nobel Prize award for Herta Müller and its unprecedented literary debate with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene and, in particular, the community of the German authors from Romania is shaken by a case that makes known the backgrounds and the downswing of a political system that is based on monitoring and focussing.
Werner Söllner is, as far as one can say, not only perpetrators, but also victims.
In his securitate act, IM Walter played a role, said after the confession of Söllner by literary scientist Michael Markel and pointed to the positive influence of IM Walter for him.
He "cut him out" in all dificient points for him at that time, says Markel.
It was a moral need for him to make this remark.
Söllner's statement was unexpected in the form and in front of this audience, but it is not surprising that the confession of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian intelligence service.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for Securitate summits, Herta Müller had already written in July in the time after she had read her own file, 914 pages.
The affected, one might suspect, are speculated and in some cases have also known, which clerical name behind the cover names Sorin, Voicu and Walter also hid.
Unlike the highly procedurally secure sighting of the Stasi acts, the handling of the leftovers of the Securitate monitoring is still very diffuse.
A systematic clarification has been behind and hindered in recent years.
One of the Birthler National Councils to review the Securitate Act (CNSAS) was established only in 1999, but the issue of the files has been rather slow ever since.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the administration of files.
According to the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very great, and an interview was held by a former Securitate Chief of Temesvar on the winner.
She had a psychosis, and finally they were only interrogated once.
The infamy of power meant being able to express itself completely in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly, the case of Söllner, as so often in connection with veiled guilt, is linked to inevitable issues.
Why now? Who has been injured? The prudent response of the listeners to Söllner's confession leaves hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by a desire to know rather than by guilt and shame.
To the genesis of Herta Müller's work, which received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Sighting Supplement Champions League
It seemed as if there was an adrenally dressed foreign servant from a very nice Christmas party on which a sports product manufacturer distributed Goodies, when the new VfB coach Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag of the equipment, rose a quarter of an hour after midnight to a famous C-Class.
The man with the striking glare was driven because of the foreign city.
Otherwise, he could have driven himself - alcohol was not in the game at all, and the 55-year-old was as little drunk as he was before luck.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow work continues.
Or get on with it.
In the words of Switzerland, which was first committed three days earlier: "We have achieved the eighth finale," that is, in the Champions League thanks to the 3:1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves be blinded by the success: there will be a brutal hard fight against the descent."
The "much more important task" is due on Sunday.
Then it is important to repeat in Mainz the king-class performance in the league everyday life.
And the well-rediscovered weaknesses after the fast three gates by Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Potrebnyak (11.).
Exploitation
The eighth final of the Champions League (recitals 16/17. + 23/24 February/ Replays 9/10. + 16/17 March) will be released on 18 December in Nyon.
So the joy of the fulminant state of the Babylon Successor remained.
Not only did the supposed healer, who in the short time had offered the uninsured Stuttgart professionals self-confidence, commitment and joy of playing.
I went to the players and told them to think about their strengths, and stopped them to be braver, said big soul clipper the simple-sounding concept of success, which under Therapeut Babbel had no effect any more.
He has triggered a certain magic, admitting Babbel advocate Jens Lehmann, "When a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a week-long break of injury, immediately advanced to the best player on the square, tried to describe the "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the workings of the new boss: "He is a man who is grasping and demanding discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation."
Under Babbel it had obviously failed to do so.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet above the mountain, warns sports director Horst Helt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs above all Konstanz.
Like Gross, players and managers also guarded against overcoming the victory against a weakened and totally overburdened defense of the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4 the evil awakening had come to mind Khedira.
And sports director Horst Helt warned that although a season goal was reached, the other was still far away.
We're not over the mountain yet.
The fact that Helt wasn't happy about his 40th birthday even after the first home win for three months was due to the events of the weekend, which took place in the form of a television interview by Torküter Jens Lehmann just before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, Helt countered Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He had shown leadership weaknesses before the board and had decided to change the coach to pressure puberty fans.
Even that his free day had been deleted after games, Lehmann valued as a sign of lack of sovereignty and displeasure.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure egoism", Helt knelt back and announced consequences for the finalist.
I don't think you're gonna be friends for life anymore, the two forty-year-olds.
But at least they agreed with all the others that without the preparatory work by the replaced coaching team, the playful and militant idea could not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a great share of the success," said Helt and Lehmann unisono - and the man also agreed with the plastic bag.
Heavyweight WM Fight
Hitzige Duel in Bern: Again and again, challenger Kevin Johnson World Champion Vitali Klitschko provoked with words and gestures.
However, after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavy-weight title after the version of the WBC.
The judge-in-chief's judgment was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains the heavyweight box world champion.
The 38-year-old champion after version of the association WBC defeated the American Kevin Johnson unanimously in Bern on Saturday (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was twice the world champion of WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, the K.o. that everyone expected failed.
Klitschko expanded his balance sheet to 39 wins in 41 professional battles, twice he had to give up due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to take the first defeat in the 24th fight.
Before about 17,000 spectators in the Bernese Arena, the 2,02-metre-large Klitschko wanted to dictate the struggle with his left hand of leadership.
The eleven centimeters smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, but repeatedly withdrew the blows of the world champion, so that Klitschko could not bring his dangerous rights decisively to the goal.
Overall, passive Johnson did not do much for a challenger and tried to get over the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his beatings rarely met the world champion.
After all, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went with Klitschko over the full distance of twelve laps.
The challenger had taken care of some vertebrae before the fight in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as a "hesitant zombie" who "cannot do anything right".
When weighing, the champion was provoked on Friday to push Johnson's sunglasses off his nose, "to see his eyes."
4th Victory to Klitschkos Comeback
Klitschko also remained victorious in his fourth battle after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After almost four years of his absence, he had beaten Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered from his "wBC belt" which he had previously had to give off campflos.
This year he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the USA in September.
In this fight I only got one blow and I'm physically very good in shape, Klitschko had explained the quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains the union of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the world champion of WBO and IBF associations.
The WBA belt, however, is worn by the Briton David Haye, after he was able to clear Nikolai Walujew's 2,13 metres in November.
Haye had previously cancelled a battle against Vitali Klitschko planned for September in the summer.
It is said that his promotion company is already planning the fight against Klitschko in the London Wembley Stadium.
Kunduz Fall
Frontal attack from the opposition: Head of Green Group Jürgen Trittin has called Defense Minister Guttenberg a liar because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
SPD and left demand clarification from the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to recent findings on the air attack by Kunduz, the opposition defence minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has committed a deliberate deception.
The minister had said "know the truth" about the deadly bombardment on two tank loads of September, said Jürgen Trittin, Director of the Green Group, on Saturday in the ARD news program "Daysschau".
It is called the commonplace: He lied.
The order to kill had been issued in violation of the rules of the International Guard Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the substance of the report that NATO had read to Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday it was announced that the attack was not only about destroying the abducted vices, but also about killing two Taliban leaders in a targeted manner.
According to NATO's investigation report, up to 142 people had been killed or injured in the US air raid requested by the German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein.
On Saturday, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) asked Green, SPD and Left to express themselves immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel needs to clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the Federal Government's Afghanistan policy - and whether the Chancellor's Office, the Bundeswehr and the News Service have approved this new strategy called for Jürgen Trittin and Green Collegin Renate Künast.
Government spokesperson Ulrich Wilhelm strongly refuted the criticism.
He said that the Chancellor's Office did not have any influence on the German Federal Armed Forces' specific efforts in Afghanistan.
On Saturday, there was also doubt about the presentation of the Ministry of the background to the resignation of General Inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to information from the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenberg have correctly and fully informed about the background of the tanker attack.
Officially, it had been said that they had denied the existence of the NATO reports and withheld sensitive details from the minister.
However, from the context of the two senior officers, they stated that they had even referred the Ministry of Defence to several reports, including a two-page document by the commanding colonel Klein and a field fighter report.
Wichert has now asked for clarification of the facts in a letter, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung".
He has not yet received an answer, says it.
The Ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and pointed out that this would be clarified in the Bundestag's Committee of Inquiry, which intends to establish itself on Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some see pictures and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of mental illness and drug abuse, the boundaries between imagination and reality are blurred.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything's fine.
If we are lying in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we may unhinderedly devote ourselves to the wildest ideas and imaginations.
However, those who experience dreamlike conditions in growing up see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are usually considered crazy or drug addicted in the modern Western world, at least as special.
However, such images and voices do not only arise from mental illness or drug abuse.
The same neuronal processes, which enable us to design houses, paint pictures or novels, sometimes cause the boundaries between dream, delusion and reality to blur.
Dream-changed guarding states can occur in various forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case delusion.
Although triggers and effects may differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanistic rapture states, psychoses and hallucinations can be traced to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of brain’s neuronal messengers – first and foremost dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine – is cleared and the interaction of various brain components is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delusions occur very frequently during a schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no more power over him.
The connection between delusion and dream has been active by philosophers and physicians since antiquity.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of dream in the wake state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, in 1861, found a "great resemblance of the Irish with dream conditions", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the inconspicuousness, delusional formations, sensory moods of such a.
It's autumn 2001, when Henning T. turns into a comic character.
His body is two-dimensional and squeaky-bunt.
Gravity no longer has power over him, he floats on the ceiling of the room.
He's feeling a step.
Behind him winged devillike shapes with bloodred, twisted frets, teething.
They hunt him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pains all over his body.
Loud, vicious voices roaring out of walls and radio.
He can no longer bear them, the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from the stereo system, knots them to a loop and fastens them to a hook on the ceiling.
He rises on a speaker and lays the loop around his neck.
Jumps.
The sling is loosening.
It's supposed to be a lesson for you, screaming the voices in drum-fucking choir, "go to the clinic and let yourself be cured!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last two years back, the first almost 20 years old.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective paranoid psychosis, and he is manic-depressive, he takes medications, against depression, the mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In the psychosis I experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The Trug Images Are Cruel Reality
About one percent of the population suffer from schizophrenia at least once in their lives, and in psychiatric clinics, it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, those affected can usually no longer distinguish between the interior and the outside world, they get into an exuberant state that can lead to hallucinations, sizes, relationship or persecution.
The voice hearing - voices that command, comment or dialogue is particularly widespread.
Also optical hallucinations are not rare.
The affected person can no longer separate from the unimportant, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded by impressions.
Like the dream, the psychosis also opens the locks for a flood of ideas and fantasies that emerge from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centric, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician at the Department of General Psychiatry at the Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is located in the center of the event, everything has a meaning directed at it.
At the same time it is in a passive role, it is, like in the dream, overwhelmed by the events and cannot actively make them.
Schizophrenics therefore often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A balance of reality is usually not possible for them, the images of tragedy are cruel reality, awakening excluded.
Once in a lifetime to have experienced a hallucination
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "but the sensual and spatial structure of reality that is perceived in psychosis remains in principle."
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are rooted in reality, the alienation of experience takes place in the real context.
Why exactly our brain beats caprioles, researchers still present puzzles.
Exceptional circumstances can lead to a short-term loss of reality in every person, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers assume that there are minimal brain damage to those affected.
We suspect that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, for example by a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a mystery as the disorder of the neural system occurs, which, moreover, at first, does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be triggers for a psychosis if the disposition is present.
Also hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis as they interact with the transmitter system.
When our brain runs hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get which, says Lübecker psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Whether Trug images are felt as pleasant or uncomfortable is often just a question of viewpoint.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and delusions for ten years, and last year he evaluated his results in the book "The Irreal World in Our Head".
Although hallucinations belong to the typical manifestations of psychoses, but also to an amazing number of other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, these often include diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's disease and skull brain trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, the brain itself hallucinates healthy people.
Hallucinations, according to box, consist of memory contents that are usually withheld.
They occur when the hareals in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or under-inhibited; if our brain is hot or even if stimulation is missing.
Drugs can cause this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But it's also a trait, stress, love balls or other mental emergencys.
In recent studies, up to one third of the respondents reported that they had experienced hallucination at least once in their lives.
In summer 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attends the Gymnasium there.
A normal girl, actually.
If there were not the pictures and voices.
During the break it can happen that a slacky boy with long, dark hair speaks to it.
When it answers him, the students look at it surprised - no one else sees or listens to this boy.
They think the shy girl is a spun daydreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows.
She's awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bank next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is, she likes the boy.
I'm crazy, she sometimes asks.
But she knows that this boy and the other Trug images are not real and disappear again.
At night the appearances are mostly frightening
Often the imagery is also a load.
When she sits in the classroom, she sometimes cannot follow the teaching material, because the teacher in her eyes and ears just introduces a new fellow student, while explaining mathematical equations for all others listening and visible at the table.
At night, the appearances are usually frightening.
When she is waiting for sleep in her dark room, which is much too rare and too late, she often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or already dreaming of whether the pictures she sees arise, the frogs or the girl with the bleeding cuts of arms and legs, in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she yells at the figures.
Parents and friends don't tell them about what they think is crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed the Abitur last year and lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she contacted the psychologist's box on the Internet, she knows exactly that she's not crazy.
Wahn is also a work of art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffering from irritation, he is likely to have hallucinations after a while, says Kasten.
I suspect the brain will then be underworked and will take care of his own conversation.
Sarah K., a single child, as a little girl, was afraid of other children, often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned with 13 that the man she calls Papa, since she can think, is not her father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same brain areas, which also process real impressions and noises, people like Sarah K. find it difficult to distinguish truces and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "is taking place in the brain, the reality arises there.
Hallucinations are also images that make the brain come about, so they work so real."
Even nightly dream images value box as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenics, mental health is able to recognize their images of tyranny as being unrealistic.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to appreciate the hallucinations also as a special ability.
Border state between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, imaginary experience is mostly pathological in our too conscious world, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and Chief Physician at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but it also contains positive, creative delusion is also a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has researched the so-called oneiroide experience form, a special form of dream-changed guard consciousness.
Oneiroide are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams that the experienced person thinks to be real and which he cannot distinguish in retrospect from the wake-up state.
The oneiroide state of consciousness occurs in trauma or illness-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor paralysis with full consciousness.
When a person is threatened with self- and world loss, for example by persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own imaginary world that is decoupled from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of boundary between dream and hallucination.
Since the management of a situation in reality is not possible, a world change takes place, but the real situation is noted in the imagination.
An intensive form of instigation and innuendo in a situation which in itself unbearable, allowing us humans their own ability to do nothing in the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Heart Change" as a rescue action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when, after a cardiac valve operation with subsequent cardiac transplantation, his consciousness travels for days, while his body is condemned to motionlessness at the intensive care unit.
Claussen dives into a self-created world, visits foreign times and places: He experiences himself as a bedridden, old man, on board a train sanatorium, a robot watches over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages under nobles who make drugs out of blood.
When dragged away by a Greek on the motorcycle in its home country, it surfs with its hospital bed in the fir snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mafioso.
He goes completely up in the imaginary events, everything is real, even later in memory.
These inner travels are fundamentally different for Claussen from any dream.
Dream is a different state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories of mental travel are clear to me even after years and in minor details.
Even more clearly and intensively than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience blows the horizon of our other life-world experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
In the end, oneiroides, psychoses, hallucinations and drug noise show how fragile our inner images of outer reality are in the guard.
Any change in the state of consciousness, the psychologist sums up the box, "may lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can be quite enriching.
The snow break may come
Burda
Children should take over the publishing house at 27 years of age
The new editor-in-chief Kallen is an interim solution: Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children in the long term, he told the SPIEGEL.
The holding company will also belong to 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children inherit at the age of 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, said the 69-year-old SPIEGEL.
We have arranged the details carefully.
The question as to whether they are also active in the company arises only after that.
The question, too, is whether they are able to do so.
7500 employees cannot imagine their children if they are not adequately qualified.
This kills the children and the company as well.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he would withdraw from the Executive Board as of January, and Paul-Bernhard Kallen was appointed his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the board at Burda since 1999.
First of all, he was responsible for technology.
Later, with the Treasury area, responsibility for the company's assets also came up and after the retirement of Jürgen Todenhöfer for direct marketing, abroad, printing and finance.
For the first time no family member is at the top of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The designation of Kallen also serves to bridge "10, 15 years", says Burda.
The holding company should also belong to 100 percent of the family in the future, says Burda.
Looking at the cases of fate and Schiffler, Burda said that even family businesses are not sure about the downfall: "This was always about families who were infected by a capital quest that had completely speculated and thought they could rise to the very big player.
My strategy was never that.
He never had world dreams, says Burda.
I don't see myself as the political precedent of this country, as it was Springer, and I don't want to play in the World League with 'Time', these shops have become too big.
Perfect Beauty
Everything you wish for in terms of beauty and well-being is now available to you.
At least that is what El Corte Inglés has done, which recently opened a shop with an area of more than 1000 m2 in the shopping centre in Callao (Madrid), where everything is just about body care.
In the wellness area, which is located on the eighth floor, you will find among other respected companies such as Hedonai, who provide a hairdress with lasers; Spaxión, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatments; hairdressers Luis & Taci, Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
However, there is also a food department that boasts more than 130 different tea varieties through its tea house.
Enjoy a relaxing massage together with your partner while having a fantastic view of the capital, or rent the relaxation area for two hours to put your own "beauty party" on your feet with eight girlfriends and then relax in the hot tub or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just some of the many opportunities that Spaxión offers.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments as well as for hydro therapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating surfaces.
The fitness studio also has this kind of devices, moreover there are also virtual trainers who take care of the training units of the customers and thus offer them a completely personal training.
You start a training unit by entering a personal password on a touchscreen that is located opposite the devices.
After that, various videos will show you how to do your training sessions correctly.
The head of the gym assures that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretch exercises) are enough to train the body muscles.
And then, after you have trained your body, you still want to see the hairdresser salon, the company Luis & Tachi has a room in which treatments for regaining the hair condition, shine and health for your hair are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at night 365 days a year.
The most diverse decolletés
Christmas is getting closer and closer, so it's a good opportunity to copy the stars' looks and bring their robes into our wardrobe.
The form of the décolleté, which is very important for highlighting the silhouette, is one of the points that needs to be considered.
Here are some proposals.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated décolleté. You can only advise against this.
Endesa and Barcelona by electric car
Together with the city of Barcelona, the power company Endesa has created the LIVE office.
This is a project for the development and promotion of the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" (Logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the Roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make agreements on mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidising, etc.
On the other hand, the project MOVELE is being developed to promote electric cars and to summarise opinions and measures in the areas concerned.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport of the future.
3 "Electric Cities"
Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville also participate in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVEL project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement seeks to promote the activities of research and technological development in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities include, among other things, activities related to energy and, in particular, to its performance.
However, it is by no means the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups across Europe and has entertained a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of tranquillity" for the automotive sector
The government president, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, predicted the Spanish automotive industry, which is the largest exporter of the country, "a horizon of tranquillity".
In presenting the 2009 economic report by the government president, Zapatero recalled the measures that the government has taken to support the automotive sector in the course of the government year.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the car industry, we would today have a perspective of neglect and closure of some of our main production plants," said the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of the car manufacturers to produce in Spain in a highly competitive industry in the future, we can see a quiet horizon for the success of this industry, which is our largest export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the competitiveness plan, part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), provided EUR 800 million for projects of 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided more than EUR 3 billion for investments.
The Head of Government stated that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and procedures.
Zapatero also underlined the government's commitment to boost demand, in line with Plan 2000E, which will be applied in cooperation with autonomous communities and car manufacturers.
According to the head of government, this plan allows the exhaust gases sold on the Spanish market to be reduced by an average of 6%, resulting in a "strong increase" in the approvals which increased by "40%" in November.

Mazda3 i-Stop: Sportability compatible with the environment
Mazda wants to prove that sportiness is entirely compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the automatic stop and drive system of the engine with the Mazda3 model, named i-Stop, a device which is available at the moment only for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of the Mazdas 3 is characterized by its good grades in the overall picture.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its street behaviour, the mechanics, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" with the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats you can find that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good grip.
It is also excellent to play the steering wheel.
Further consideration of the unit, which consists of the instrument panel and the dashboard, it can be found that Mazda with a variety of buttons and switches in the eye-catching colors red and blue, on the same line as the Japanese trend to a futuristic interior design.
This style partly reminds us of the style of the Honda Civics.
That is why it can be said that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, stand out from the soberness of the German automobiles, especially the Volkswagen Golf, which all want to surpass.
The passenger dream of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the appropriate comfort so that four adults can easily drive by car.
All this comes with a large and clearly shaped trunk.
The stop and stop system is now only available for the 2-litre petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed switch.
This engine is a real pleasure. Its subtlety, its silent sound, its performance and its low consumption are a source of strength.
And all those who don't drive many kilometers a year should consider this i-stop with a petrol engine because of its great comfort in walking and its low consumption, even if Mazda especially the diesel models are the most sold.
With regard to the equipment, the so-called model Sportive selected for the test trip is a special feature, since it has a much larger number of elements from the standard equipment.
The RVM, which thus removes the dead angle, also the controls for traction and stability, the speed control, the light-sensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio Bluetooth, as well as the chromed 17-inch rims, are highlighted by the standard equipment.
Moreover, this version also includes, as if it were not yet enough equipment, the Premium package, which contains for an additional 1,500 euros: in addition to other elements, especially the learningable Bixenon headlights and the BOSE sound system with CD-loader.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding with regard to the materials used, due to its driving behaviour and the variety of equipment.
Moreover, those who do not cover many kilometres per year can also buy the i-stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
The only negative on this model is its slightly high price, which lies between 21.770 euros for the Luxury model and 23.270 euros for the tested sportive model.
However, in return for this high price, the Mazda3 offers us the new highest daily pass.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L. A. rolls out the red carpet of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine", the stars, dressed in models that look just as elegant as sexy, glowed more than ever.(Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "pee", as elegant as ever, opted for a dark "Lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is also limited to a device with which you can only read e-mails without a possibility to see certain attachments or to browse the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it chose Time magazine to be one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is rather unlikely, but the idea in itself is nevertheless especially for young people of interest.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek costs only very little and has a very cheap flatrate, for example only half of the price of the flatrate of an iPhone.
After the company has seen the success, it has brought two new devices to the market: one that is intended only for Twitter, the other with a life-long free data service, quite unlike Peek, where you have to pay a six-time higher price.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same boundaries as its American counterpart, however, has prepared a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price for the telephone, about 12 euros a month, includes roaming for all of Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to have to give up all the data to be able to read their emails as soon as you cross the country border or if you desperately seek a café with WIFI (or a connectivity with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flatrate is incredibly seductive and should have been possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for stays abroad, but according to my experience, you already need a doctorate in physics and a good glasses to read all the small prints.
The repeated criticism by the European Commission of affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of Europe was almost always ignored.
One is always afraid to read his e-mails and rightly so.
The fact that a small device like FonPeek (although it is always amazing that it has the name Fon, although it does not have a Wifi/WLAN) can offer these types of tariffs means that telephone providers need to slowly, but safely rethink and start considering different ways of using their data network.
Kindle is another good example of this, its prices include downloading books and further inquiries on the Internet.
Without leash and without hooks.
This is an internet-enabled device and it is only paid once, when you buy it, and not month by month.
And that's exactly what I expect one day from FonPeek, a purchase opportunity with life-long Internet access as it already offers Peek in the US.
And that's not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails by phone, thank you.
But I expect this because I believe it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to be able to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish color of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American First Lady.
Even when Barack Obama was president of the United States, she appeared in a dress and a coat of this color and has chosen the same color again to accompany him in his life, no doubt, the second most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore very similar models on both occasions: that it was almost the same color - a shiny greenish yellow -, the clothes consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat made of the same fabric-, and she wore a little large embroidered or necklace.
It goes even so far that at first sight it appeared that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two dresses are very different from the fabric they are made from.
At the inauguration she wore a dress made of lace and in Oslo of a patterned velvet.
The accessories were also different: for the first time green shoes with half high heels and for the second time an obscene model, but gold colors.
Also the hairstyle was different each time: the hair was raised on this occasion as a hair wreath, while the previous hair was open.
75% of mothers in employment have had problems in work because of motherhood
Discrimination in work has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want to have children.
This is the result of the study on women's fertility and career in Spain conducted by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for Women.
The survey among 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt that 75% of women in employment see their career prospects restricted on the labour market due to their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are major differences in the decision to establish a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women work or not, and if so, what type of occupation they practice.
Those of them who do not do any other work outside the house, work only half-day or have no fixed employment contract, become mothers and have more children.
By contrast, women are shifting with permanent employment, especially in the public sector, the establishment of a family and maternity and therefore have fewer children.
"The women in the age group aged between 35 and 49 with a fixed employment get their first child on average only 3.7 years after the contraction, a number which increases to 4.1 years for women with fixed employment who have needed longer to achieve this and who have achieved their contraction and the first child only a lot later.
In addition, the type of work has a major influence on motherhood, although less than the calendar of readiness to receive it," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor which must be taken into account at the age of women at the time of marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, the age at the time of marriage and the first child is the higher the level of education.
This difference could also be seen for women of the same age.
For example, women in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, depending on whether they only have primary education or higher education, were on average mothers with 25.1 or 32.1 for the first time.
There is also a further difference between women, depending on their level of education.
While the women get married with primary schooling and get their first child, the women with a middle or high school degree do it just differently and first look for a permanent position and get married after that and then get their first child, Delgado notes.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris recently added a new name to its widely envied list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
As of next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and will also say the well-known advertisement "Because you are worth it".
The main actress from "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actresses at the international level, will become another famous hanging sign like Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spaniard Penélope Cruz.
Before her were the last to join this exclusive club, the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
In the case of men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey ́s Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (a playmate of Evangeline in "Lost").
The award ceremony of the UK fashion industry
The British share an important word in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today - met at the annual award ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
On this occasion they had all appeared.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was chosen as the best model this year.
Manuel Vicent’s Poker Game
In "Poker der Asse" (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) Manuel Vicente presents the three X-rays of writers who accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, also in real life).
He does not use a predictable and fear - inspiring genre (short biography, life and work), but looks for an agility to the glowing heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicent does not save on horrors or enlightenments.
Außer, that this book is a delicious reading pleasure, it is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "When reading his pages, I found out that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual drive, just as I have always felt it, without having found words for it: the joy in contrast to the unhappy fate, the moral without guilt and innocence without any God".
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in the blood, not in his mind, between impotence and ignorance, with an overwhelming poetic humor, without any sense, like the blade that almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was united by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh the emotions of adultery were united with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that was to come into heaven on the demise of destruction."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was published in 1922 in Paris by Sylvia Beach. This is one of the 8000 summits in world literature, one has to climb up on the north wall, on the wall where the best climbers are trying again and again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a comical cat.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the heir of a estate owner of the county and again other times he said that he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
Both dreams were born of a certain size."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took up the mad cry, which was screamed out from a bridge by that person from Munich, so that his echo fell deep into the night of the 20th century in his literary way. He made this on a journey, on which he fled from himself and with a speech full of violence in front of the worms infused the afterworld.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she knelt herself and prayed: my dear God, I beg you to do everything in your power, so that I may at last cease to write like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave are these verses engraved by Spencer: ' sleep after the effort,/ after the thunderstorm of the harbor,/ the rest after the war,/ after a full life you will find delight in death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage, she always had her depression.
The husband took it with complete normality when she told him that Eduard VII was spying on it between the Azales or singing the birds in Greek.
It is not only known where the man put up with so much patience and was in love with a neurologist whose literary talent was still much deeper than their madness."
About Pío Baroja: "What else did Martín-Santos do than try to invade Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet intend if he did not bring Baroja to the weapons of Faulkner?
What did Cela do, except to destroy the glory of that man, that he might put himself on this podium?"
Fiery Aggression
My 70-year-old mother walked through our neighborhood last week in Fuenlabrada, when suddenly a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 came next to her and our dog, our dog is a mix that we took out of the shelter and weighs just six kilos, and then from a warmer sky they missed him two footsteps and hurt him hard with it.
Our disarmament cannot be put into words at all, because it is incomprehensible to us, because the fun of a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which was naturally carried out on the leash.
In addition, there is the suffocation that a woman who was walking quietly had when she wanted to bring these people to justice because of the incident, she even feared for her own life, because if such a madman attacks a dog, he may also be doing the same with a woman, a child, an older gentleman or probably even with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred in a usually quiet neighborhood at five o'clock in the afternoon on a very ordinary Tuesday.
The dog's been crying all day.
Of course, in a nearby police station, we have a lot of doubts about whether this will bring anything at all and to prevent any prejudice from the beginning, we just want to make it clear that the cowards were Spaniards.
Our disarmament over the event has prompted us to report this incident.
We cannot understand what must be done in the minds of these young people that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for the animals and persons have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Transport Safety Foundation (Fesvial), launched a campaign to promote helmet use, particularly in younger motorcyclists, as both companies today announced.
This initiative seeks to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, since it is ultimately the only protection element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign was part of its commitment to road safety, which "consists far more than just the design and manufacture of products that are becoming more and more secure every day" and further reiterated that it also contributed to other actions of educational and informational character to a step closer to this goal every day.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets on the motorcycle, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will be distributed in a first phase posters to over 500 motorbike workshops in order to achieve the best possible distribution.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that road safety is "an ongoing concern" of the company, and precisely because as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles it is always committed to the development of ever safer products, which one of its main objectives must be the development of ever safer products.
The sale of small trucks is rising again a bit
After almost two years the car market for small transporters finally starts to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles authorised in Spain in November mean an increase of 12.6% in relation to 2008 and, much more importantly, they are the first ever to grow after 22 consecutive months with a steady decline, in line with the figures presented by the Anfac and Ganvam manufacturer’s association.
However, these good figures are currently only very cautious, as the November 2008 reference data used for the comparison were a particularly poor sales year with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
However, it must be borne in mind that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total allowances for these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures for the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but in this number all vehicles made up of the small transport market are included: descendants of passenger cars, pick-ups, small transporters, small vans and lighter small trucks/cars.
Furthermore, the same clouds in the sky are still the same, which are most prone to demand, as even though some of the vehicles are purchased by private individuals, the majority of sales to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100 % of all cases make the purchase with a third-party financing.
Thus, to these restrictions, which are the consequence of the spin-off of credit institutions, we need to include additional factors, such as the increase in unemployment or the continuation of the bad economic situation.
With this panorama and unlike the passenger cars, the financial support for the purchase of a 2000E vehicle has helped little.
However, this plan is not only intended for private individuals, even self-employed and small companies have a right to purchase if they want to buy a small carrier up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 outburst, which may not exceed 160 grams per kilometer driven, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, Ganvam had reminded us that it was essential for the state to pay special attention to these small trucks as well as, of course, industrial vehicles (cars and buses).
The Car Dealer Association predicted a similar year for the year 2010 as it was just past, for which it expects a sales loss (for passenger cars and off-road cars) of 19%.
Support for brake manoeuvres in critical situations is now mandatory
As with the ABS anti-lock braking system at the time, and as is the case with the ESP stability control, emergency braking systems need to become a necessary equipment in European cars.
In fact, they are already required for all newly authorised passenger cars and light small carriers, for the remaining vehicles a standstill period was set until the end of February 2011.
The measures adopted by the European Union are aimed at improving the protection of pedestrians, but these braking systems can also help to prevent many road accidents due to their working methods.
The task of the emergency brake assist is to apply more pressure to the brakes in the event of a critical brake manoeuvre, which detects the system on the brake pedal based on the braking strength performed by the driver.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, one-third of the drivers involved in an accident were no longer able to hit the brake pedal before the collision, and half of them had not braked with full force.
Up to 1.100 accidents
The brake aid, on the other hand, intervenes with maximum force in the braking system and thereby reduces the braking time and thus also the brake distance a car travels during braking.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake assist, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be prevented every year.
There would be even fewer accidents - one expects that every fourth accident could be prevented by personal injury - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects (via radar or camera) obstacles and warns the driver, while at the same time exerting a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver responds, the system will help him increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is already inevitable, the brake assist exerts maximum pressure on the brakes in order to minimise the damage.
General Motors shifts the plan for Opel until January
While the Opel workers in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) were already informed by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on April 8, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer points out that he needs more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new Chairman of GM Europe, wants to achieve that the side concerned already gives its approval to each point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, the final document, which will be presented first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries in which there are works, may be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
However, GM is assured that it will take a decision on the sale of Saab in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on American car manufacturers to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with some possible new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who also likes to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the skyper sports car, who has back coverage from the Russian group Converg, is gaining ever stronger acceptance.
If none of these buyers made an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold until then, will continue to be maintained.
At the tax of Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewels, the engineers used the Boxster S as the basis and really managed to make it 80 kilos easier, so he now brings only 1,275 kilos to the scales.
In order to create such a thing, they refused to use the automatic folding roof, which was replaced by a tent wall roof with manual drive, so that alone they saved 21 kilos; thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model such as those of the GT3 "wiring" another 15; by removing the air conditioning again 13; moreover, they reduced the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, thus saving another 7 kilos; by installing the sporty Bacquet seats even 12 and saving five again with the light 19-inch rims.
Then, due to the omission of the CDR-30 audio system, another six kilos had been reached less and the missing kilo was reached by the replacement of the door handles by handles made of fabric.
Although it is also available with the double coupling transmission PDK, the test drive was carried out with a vehicle with 6-speed manual transmissions, mainly on the smaller coasts of California, on mountain tracks that were really very curvy.
In his driving behavior, you can only give him the note perfectly.
However, the reduction in its weight has by no means led to his becoming less secure on the streets.
It is more the opposite of the case: for a long time we have not already tested such a small and light model, but at the same time gives a feeling of great safety in the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, capable of warming his muscles at a low pace in the necessary time until we give him the orders to race, slow down, slow down, then recover and then again get everything out of his engine ...
The car does everything we can with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering, which is as communicative as well as precise.
And he's doing it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) has been very successful and you can increase it with the 'sport' option as well as with a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used by the Panamera for the first time.
The ability to accelerate is unimaginable brutal, whether out of the standing or on re-acceleration.
The joints are strong, but not harsh or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the highways on which we drove with the boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the keyholes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the entire route; and that, although we found ice in some of these curves in the morning gray and roll split in the morning.
In summary, you can say that it is an ultralight car, a car with which you have an indescribable ride, as it otherwise probably is rather rare and in it is much more than just a small improvement of the boxster Ss.
The car will be on the market in February 2010 and cost 70,831 EURO.
Bag Girl
The singer, a bus friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the cosmetics line Coco Coco Cocoon and an occasional starlet at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same neck rigidity as her bags of Chanel.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she is a "Bag Girl".
Baskonia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral, despite the many outstanding players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, celebrated an outstanding triumph with 82-91 during his visit to the complex football field of Maccabi Electra and thus comes to the first place within his group after the great appearance of Mirza Teletovic, who was with eight three times the best of his team (29 when rated).
The team from Vitoria was able to replace the major failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov by a large dose of effort and teamwork, even if they had to wait until the bitter end for their victory.
The great hits out of the perimeter with 16 rated triples contributed significantly to their final victory.
The game began with the blue-red leadership, which started at the top of the scoreboard from the beginning.
Since the first four crews from Vitoria had already come out of the perimeter, it was already possible to imagine that they had come to the field with well-heated wrists.
It was English and Teletovic who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, only that the team from Álava decided to play Barac inside and for the game of Eliyahu, who was received on his return to the team with whistles and applause, which is his home to further expand their advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic already began to highlight himself as the best of his team with 13 points, even though the "minus six" rating of splitter already thought this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, despite the clear advantage of the break, the game was not yet decided for a long time and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Vitorians that on their playing field they did not win everyone, and thanks to the repeatedly attacking "hand of Elias" they returned to the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the "golden" turning the row (50-49).
More Disadvantages
The Ivanovic team, injured, but everything but dead, had to prepare a couple of matches with certainty to get air again and one of them suddenly came to Mirza Teletovic's gun, which with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas, made sure that the signboard showed another catchy distance of (54-67) which the host could embellish at the end of the third quarter with (57-67).
The Alavesens were blossomed in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they had earned in the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson resigned, the best of their team did not and tried to give up their team again by three points from the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and although Splitter was put out of place because of Fouls, Ivanovic's team did not give up, well defended themselves and although the Israelis still picked up in the last minute (80-85), the game had already lost a winner and Tel Aviv for the first time in this season.
Injury prevented Unicaya from being offered the forehead
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and had to resign to him in Group B of the Euroliga, and that in a game marked by the failures of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the interior, which facilitated the victory of the Greeks.
The Málaga team was not afraid of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship, nor of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their offered game in the first quarter, the Andalusians were allowed to begin dreaming. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, the hosts faded with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of its Unicaja, even though the local team with an internal game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed to show that the billboards in 13 minutes 22-20 showed their favor, the minute in which, due to an action, it had come almost to battle between the two Americans Beverley and Williams and therefore both were disqualified.
The Greek team started to get warm at last and its superiority on both sides of the game, while leaving the Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three self-made errors of Carlos Jiménez left clear traces of the Unicaja.
Among their inner players and the Lithuanian forerunner Linas Kleizas, with his triples, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A pick-up was impossible
The third quarter of the game was characterized by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, which proved superior despite its 19 losses and even managed to compensate for the difference in the Málaga game with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn brought the lead within the group down.
Unicaja tried to get rid of the many failures and withdrawals of Robert Archibald, injured during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja, thanks to the leadership and the triple of Cook and the use of Lewis again came a little hope on 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible, as the Olympics, as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with centimeters within the basket area, were not to be braked.
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic succeeded in the 37th minute to raise the basket difference to 81-62 and Unicaya had to be beaten and the tour had to resign to Olympiacos.
How much should you earn on Facebook because of your profile?
The users of Facebook can now, thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with most displays of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain, experience their salary that they should earn due to their profile.
The "How much should you earn?" tool calculates the salaries of the users on the basis of more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. Users are provided with a form in Facebook that allows them to enter their profession, professional experience, age and the city in which they work.
Already after a week after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found out that the Spanish worker on average feels "badly paid," explains the person responsible for the product Trovit, Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spaniards are the worst paid according to the data that Trovit has through its search engines in Great Britain and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross salary of 45,226 euros and a Frenchman 31,059, as opposed to the 24,000 euros a Spaniard earns.
Consequently, a truck driver has an annual net salary of 34,247 euros in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid work in Spain is that of a waiter with a net annual value of 11,592 euros, followed by the work of a seller with 14,725 euros and that of a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are those of a driver, half-day jobs and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date of departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in her message in Tegucigalpa.
The President-in-Office of the Council must leave diplomatic representation by 27 January 2010 at the latest if his term of office expires officially
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knew that he must have left the message in which he had found asylum since September 21.
"He is aware that he must leave on January 27th, as his mandate expires on that day and he must look for a new accommodation."
The sender also quoted the ex-president, who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the scheduled date: "My point of view is to go as soon as possible, logically with the coverage of the government of Brazil," Zelaya said on the phone.
After the elections on November 29th (who had won Porfirio Lobo) Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to get refuge in Brazil.
This failed, however, in the refusal of Zelayas to recognise the status of an asylum seeker who wanted to force the de facto government, chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much!
After the most seductive days since last spring, when the inflation of assets was the dominant mood on the markets, the uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is by no means surprising, since this is their natural state, in an environment in which brokers make decisions about a naturally uncertain future.
The measure used to stabilise the markets was to compensate for the debt with the direct purchase of assets and to leave it indirectly free of liquidity for interest that moves around zero so that banks buy assets to settle.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are virtually complete and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, begin to scatter some sand into the transmission system, as the BCE has just done with its annual auction, which takes place next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without these heterodox measures and we will just be witnessing a reversal in reducing risk premiums.
The volatility of stock exchanges and the differences in corporate bonuses are rising again, even though they are still far away from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to take private risks and sovereign debt rose again.
We are now going back to quality and the USA, Japan and Germany are the preferred place of refuge for investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between the countries of the Eurozone and Germany.
Spain has not yet been affected by this episode of instability, but then came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new revision down regarding Spain's assessment.
On the other hand, a certain uncertainty is not damaging in order to silence the defenders of the moral risk, who had again tried to create a consciousness among world economic policy leaders for what they had caused, since they had slowed down the devastating effects of limiting loans to the loss of jobs when they should have decided a new day of thanksgiving.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai points to a tribal war between the Emirs to restore power in the Emirates, and the development in Greece was also foreseen in the past.
A government that conceals the sovereign debt, elections and a new government that draws on the same strand.
Prodi made it to Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal to Durão Barroso in Italy.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to rescue Hungary from non-fulfilment of its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and thus allow a euro member country to stop complying with its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to include its citizens in the need for extraordinary measures in order to maintain the stability of state funds.
Yes, we are as expected before an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some divergences on too high amounts, would now be within the expected range.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in government debt increase at the same rate as the European corporate bonuses.
If, however, European differences were to be reduced and Spanish were to continue to increase, this would be a special risk for Spain.
Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the above mentioned indicators force a large proportion of market research institutes to prefer their scenarios for recovery and to correct their 2011 scenario up, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which come back with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all of this does not promise a long life despite warnings.
Again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment it is called "Be careful when driving".
Connected branches
The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to appear in front of Parliament's subcommittee yesterday, where the strategy on the energy supply of Spain is being debated in the next two decades.
After his appearance, followed by the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some clues about what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola, by 2020, Spain will have to invest 50 billion euros and another 60 billion from that date until 2030, subject to the assumption that the current nuclear power plants will continue to operate.
If this were not the case, the investment needed would not amount to 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that it is no longer necessary to invest in an increase in energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international alliances.
As of 2020, the question will change and performance should be increased.
His proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with carbon capture facilities and, of course, on renewable energies.
In this case, he assumes that 18,000 MW will be needed more, under the prerequisite, of course, by other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft bill for a sustainable economy, which has just been adopted by the government, is on a line with what his company has called for, wanted by no means to say anything against this law, such as creating incentives for national coal consumption, which would be the opposite of all political strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "there is a clear long-term focus on this direction, despite some "individual" measures, as she referred to as the chairman of Iberdrola.
Be it as it may, Mr Galán believes that the decisions on investment, even if they are long-term, should be taken as it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created to tackle them.
Ferrovial gets the "handling" from Aer Lingus at ten airports
Ferrovial's subsidiary for services at airports on the ground, Switzerland's Switzerland, is the preferred partner of the Irish Flugesellschaft Aer Lingus for luggage services at ten European airports where they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, to which no figures have yet been published, is set at five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a protocol for cooperation to create an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructures.
The Alliance plans investments of 20 million to 2012, of which 50 % will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to examine energy efficiency at motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with Hochtief and Bouygues for his first motorway construction in Australia
Acciona fights for the approval of its first motorway in Australia, a market in which they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief are its competitors.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and highway operator.
The city administration would like to have completed the construction at the end of 2014.
After the administration for public-private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) had decided to advance the project according to a business plan drawn up by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and toll station management.
In anticipation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investment amounts to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1,047 billion euros), while in the last phase three consortia, mainly made up of European construction companies, compete with each other.
The group named Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of Australia's largest construction companies, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the best construction specialists.
The Northern Direct Consortium, formed by the British company Laing O'Rourke, is the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for infrastructure and the French Bouygues.
The third and last consortium, which is in the narrowest section, is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (the subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), also the local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specializes in public construction.
The Australian market for infrastructure promises enormous construction work and privatisation, however, has a hurdle to overcome, as it is only through the purchase of a local construction company that has access to it.
A strategy which has been followed by the companies named Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which must only be followed by the Spanish giants.
Even ACS has gained access to this market only by its 30% stake in high depth, owner of the said Leighton.
Millions of Assets
Acciona places the highest importance on this geographical area for the industry, where it is already well known as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry because of its activity.
Under other assets, it already has its largest windmill park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies responsible for building and managing Adelaide’s desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
It is now his intention to consolidate and use these synergies in these two areas in order to gain access to the building and infrastructure branches.
The subterranean toll line, which will be promoted by the Office for Infrastructure of the City of Brisbane and called Northern Link (Nordzubüber), has the purpose of connecting the western highway in Toowong with the bypass road in Kelvin Grove (see map) on a length of 5 kilometres through tunnels. This is the largest measure of congestion reduction on Brisbane's streets.
The schedule, issued by the City Administration, foresees the award for summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Even if this toll line is to be opened for traffic in the last months of 2014, it is assumed that construction work will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The government of Queensland participates in the financing with 500 million Australian dollars (EUR 308 million).
Brisbane is already a big business for high-deep.
Australia is awarding high-level contracts, which yesterday signed a contract with the government of 154 million, repeatedly considerable contracts.
The ACP sub-company will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fiber optic cables by means of its local subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will enable 400,000 people to access the Internet quickly and employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the construction project of King George Towers with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction work has not yet begun and high depth has received 129 million.
Also in the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and management of two schools to 25 years.
The initial investment amounts to 75 million euros.
FCC receives the contract for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has acquired over its subsidiary Alpine, the construction of a tunnel over 2.1 kilometres long for a motorway in Slovenia over the sum of 64,5 million euros.
The company received this contract only a few days after it received the surcharge for the construction work for the extension of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in tunnelling.
Construction is scheduled to start in early 2010 and its implementation will be over 32 months.
Sri. Rushmore receives advertising from Renfe
Renfe has committed the advertising and marketing services for the next two years of the agency Sra. Rushmore over a sum of approximately three million euros annually, the railway company announced.
This contract also includes the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sri. Rushmore was selected among 16 agencies, which presented themselves to this competition, which Renfe announced, 4 of which came to the final round, among them TBWA, which had been responsible for advertising over the last three years.
From now on, Sri. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
Punishment over 63 million for France Télécom because of the slowdown of competition.
France Télécom has imposed a penalty of over EUR 63 million for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean areas belonging to the country.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition in landline and mobile phones by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and loyalty programmes for consumers on the margins of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly company has accumulated more than EUR 560 million in penalties since 1994 because of the handicap of its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was even increased, as the authority which is waiting for the competition believes that France Télécom has committed similar crimes in the past and has therefore become reckless again.
Retail trade services
On the other hand, the subsidiary of the French company has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened up an application trade site on the Internet to increase revenue from non-telephone transactions.
In principle, this application website is active in France and the United Kingdom.
You have to wait until 2010 until this site will also be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The game at the Champions League has contributed Madrid and Barça 476.4 million since the beginning.
The Champions League has developed itself since its birth in 1992 as a source of revenue for the football club.
So much that Real Madrid and Barcelona have since taken 476.4 million, bringing them the third and fifth place of the football clubs that have earned the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
Winning the Champions League of UEFA not only brings fame with it. It is also one of the main sources of revenue of the major clubs.
According to the UEFA, the league has distributed up to 5.362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) participating in this event since its founding in the 1992/93 season.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club is located in third place in Europe, which has earned the most money through its participation and the only one who has won the trophy three times in addition to the AC Milan.
The leading Catalan champion and the last winner of the former European Cup in 1992 is the fifth.
The list leads Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams that also took the most money through their participation in the last Champoins League.
And that, although they have lost against Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only in third place of the countries that have been able to raise money by the Champions, although it has more titles than all others (five, unlike four bee Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated money-sharing process used by UEFA.
In this financial year, the organisation, chaired by Michel Platini, expects revenues of 1,090 million from the Champions League.
Of this money, the UEFA foresees 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs participating in the qualifying round (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
Moreover, those who fought for participation received 3,8 million due to their bloody presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they fought.
There is also a bonus for winning (800.000 euros) and for an undecided (400,000 euros per team). The clubs that have come to the eighth-finals receive three million each; the four that have come to the quarter-finals receive 3.3 million each.
The last four get 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, as opposed to the second, who receives 5.2 million.
So a football club gets at least 7.1 million and at most 31.2 million fixed revenues.
Barça, in turn, earned 2.5 million with his victory at the European Supercup in August.
However, there are also the variable payments for which 337,8 million are planned.
This money is allocated proportionally to the value of each single television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 assigned places.
Last year's champion receives 40% of the money allocated, 30% of the second, 20% of the third place and 10% of the fourth place.
The other part is distributed according to the number of games they play at this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% participation in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group yesterday passed on details of the sale of shares, with which it wants to acquire a ceiling between 25 and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage which, due to the number of shares, does not force them to make a public tender (opa).
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per share, which is paid out to ten years and with an interest rate of 1% per year due to this shift.
Yesterday, the Sos shares closed with EUR 1.85 and Nueva Rumasa rated 18% below market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 Euro reflects the real evaluation of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The group from Jerez gives shareholders a period of 15 days to inform them of their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed of this offer, although the company Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had come into contact with the Authority.
At a close, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure its management.
When trying to stay on the verge of possible sales offers and the judicial challenges of his ex-managers, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of the internal book exam.
A decision that makes her the first woman to have a high position in the food business.
It is a newly created post directly under the leadership of the group.
This is anything but free from polemics, because the company is involved in a judicial battle for suspicion of diversion of more than 230 million Sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
Sos cannot be excluded from moving capital in the course of the next few months.
With regard to Salazar's loan, ex-consultants Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) appeared yesterday before the National Assembly and confirmed that they had approved the shift of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV approves Paterina’s public procurement notice submitted by the investment company Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public exclusion invitation to tender for Federico Paternina submitted by the Investment Company Mer last 9 October.
The supervisory authority stated that it approved this invitation to tender after it had been proved that the conditions of the law-enforced laws are complied with and can therefore be considered as "sufficient" in the content of the explanatory leaflet submitted, according to the amendments of the last 2 December.
CNMV has also announced that this offer is aimed at acquiring 550,0008 shares from Federico Paternina at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, which in turn is 8.95 % of the capital of the company, which consists of EUR 6,142,786 in shares admitted to Madrid and Bilbao.
Furthermore, it has been announced that 5,592,778 million shares have been fixed, which cannot be transferred in any way until the tender has been concluded and whose price has been determined by Federico Paternina in accordance with law.
New programmes for the assessment of vehicles
In these days of storms and accidents not only the car workshops deserve
Every day thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are dragged into workshops where an assessor has to assess the damage caused and the cost of repair.
No one accident is the same and the calculation of the costs for the parts and hours of work can be a lengthy and complicated task.
The calculation of the repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros by hand, including parts and hours of work, may take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest information technology tools, it is a matter of minutes
Therefore, almost 100 % of the assessors use this type of system.
The service and application providers for the assessment of accidents and repairs collect the information they receive from manufacturers to process them afterwards and to offer them to their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all reports are produced with their products.
The other two companies competing in the tool market for the assessment and preparation of a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data the manufacturers provide is anything but simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Sales Manager of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers are working together, each of them providing the information in a different format.
Moreover, the volume of data to be processed is becoming ever bigger, up to the point that more versions, variants and motorizations have been on the market in the last five years than in the entire fifteen years before.
As soon as a new car enters the market, the company will start work.
It is a laborious task, for every single one of the aber thousand vehicle parts must be catagolysed and its price entered.
In addition, each model creates an "intelligent" graphic image on which to "click" different parts of the vehicle.
In the case of a much sold model, work can be completed in a week if the procedure is carried out quickly.
If it is a less common car, it can take up to three or four months. Currently, Audatex has 99.2% of the car sold in Spain with complete information.
Among the more exclusive models, they have information about the Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the roadside vehicle fleet, it is over 99%.
For the execution of documentation work and the production of databases, Audatex has eight centres distributed worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them has specialised in certain brands.
The National Headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
More than a hundred technicians (normally mechanics) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in the preparation of these databases.
Each month they record 2.5 million data and their customers receive updates every second day.
The development of this huge flow of information enables companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, but depending on the country there are also tools for managing scrap parts or for calculating the fault or residual value of a car.
The only company that knows about a leader who knows the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
With the transparency of the products that Audatex offers, you can easily get an overview of the type of support it provides to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, while the star of the AudaPlus products is a standard solution for handling accidents for the assessors.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it contains the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint prices.
This tool is paid according to purpose, i.e. for each opinion.
It is most expensive for customers who rarely use it 10 times a month, i.e. 5.75 euros per month.
On the other hand, any insurance company that produces thousands of opinions negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran from the assembly belt alone using the chassis number.
AudaGlass deals with the vehicle panes, and AudaSubastas is an online service open to the specialist market, which can be used to provide vehicles that have been declared a total damage.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, carrying out geodemographic analyses or obtaining information on variations by brand and model.
For example, you can examine how many models of a particular car brand had to be found in the workshop due to breakdowns or how many of them had been involved in a serious accident in a particular period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this kind of computer tools.
It distributes among other Gt estimates, which are also intended for reviewers, providing the same type of digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a group of companies founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions to assess damage, breakdowns or maintenance of vehicles.
The GT expert leader is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3.100 assessors and 53 insurance companies.
Its volume of business has increased by 20% annually over the last three years and sales amounted to 10.8 million euros in 2008.
At the beginning of last year they began to go to the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of their business is in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The total turnover in the world of the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) amounts to 557 million dollars, 3.35 more than in 2008.
In addition, the company has revenue of 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion on the stock market and today its shares are traded at a value of 2.4 billion dollars.
Since 2007, they have been on the New York Stock Exchange and part of the reference index Standard & Poor's.
Sale of accident cars on the Internet
In the past October, the Solera Autoonline Group purchased a platform on the Internet for the sale of motorbikes and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and added value, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This review and purchase service is exclusively addressed to industry professionals, such as insurance companies, consultants, car rental companies, workshops, scrap shops and car dealers, who must be registered prior to their activities.
This platform was founded in Germany in 1996 and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of which alone in Germany.
Their main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website today has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 auditors.
Every day 3,000 ads are managed and 100 new ads are added every day to the Spanish market.
Under the Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose chassis numbers have been declared must no longer drive on the streets, but certain parts which are not damaged may be used as spare parts.
On the other hand, cars of historical value may be re-authorised even if they have been de-registered after difficult authorities.
Cost estimate of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Audatex ensures that the user is given a cost estimate in just four steps:identification of the vehicle, search of the spare part, creation and creation of a cost estimate.
The ease of handling of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially in order to convince the older professionals, who are usually more or less opposed to the use of these new computer technologies.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger cars, 109 off-road cars, 137 motorcycles, 78 small hauliers and 44 trucks.
Of course you need a computer with Internet connection to use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified on the basis of the chassis number, a chart of the respective model appears and after that the replacement part required is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price for the hours of work, surcharges or discounts and thereafter can have the cost estimate printed and passed on to his customers.
However, AudaTaller is not a tool for assessing such as AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented working time does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool is 350 Euro per year, an amount that the customer can pay without further notice.
Currently, the company Audatex is working on offering these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that auto mechanics have been waiting for for a long time, as you can, for example, choose a door and then turn the image completely to look at the inside.
