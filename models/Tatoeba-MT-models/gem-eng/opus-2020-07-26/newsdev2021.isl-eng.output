Biden conducts peer reviews in three key states
When there are only 100 days to vote, Joe Biden, a candidate of the Democratic Party, is taking advantage of the lead in three important fluctuating states.
CNN reports today that Biden was crossing Florida, Arizona, and Michigan.
In Florida, Biden measures 51% against 46% of the president.
In Arizona, there is a 49% – 45% biden in the wild and Michigan is heading for the victory of Biden, leading by 12 points, 52% – 40%.
To win the election in November, after 100 days, Trump has to turn all these states into us, and actually more.
Trump spends these days with a coronal virus epidemic that he is increasingly being taught by the countrymen, saying that the majority of the polls in the United States have responded badly, or very badly, at the beginning of the epidemic.
In addition, Trump has found it difficult to escape protests and riots that resulted in the death of George Floyd.
According to Trump and his government, they have dealt badly or incorrectly with them.
To crown Trump's problems, he is now under more serious criticism for ordering federal police to break protests in cities where mayors or governors are Democrats.
It has created tremendous wolfyness among the inhabitants of the cities, and that anger has spread to other Americans.
Also, pictures of federal agents rubbing protesters into unmarked cars have not helped the cause of the United States.
The Lincoln Project highlighted this issue, but it can be seen below.
Trump won all three states in 2016, but with a very small vote.
In fact, Trump won very many states with a low vote and won the elections with minor votes.
Michigan, for example, won only 10,704 votes.
It's less than 0.5% of the population.
Nearly all the polls that political commentators say are significant are showing the same conclusion that Biden is making.
A new survey of CNN in Arizona shows that Biden’s advantage is now out of the scope of the survey.
The same goes for CNN and Quinnipiac University of Florida.
In fact, Fox News, who leaned right and declared support for Trump 2016, has published the same material in its media.
The President’s last hope, according to the conclusions of the questions, is that Trump could be expected to return to important places within a flexible area if the focus of the campaign is on the economy.
The economy of the United States took a heavy hit following the Covid-19 epidemic, but voters do not seem to be linking the economic crisis with the coronation virus epidemic.
That is to say, the vast majority of voters seem to have taught Trump to have been ill-responsive to the Crown Virus epidemic, but they trust him more to deal with the economic crisis that is taking place in the state at this time.
However, Trump has had a hard time directing the campaign.
As a result of the riots that have been on fire almost continuously since the video came across, the video was intimidating when four police officers killed George Floyd, Trump tried to direct the discussion about its law enforcement and importance.
Law and Order, became his adjectives.
It seems that it has now been completely lost, as previously said.
As the polls lean more towards Trump, more and more Republicans are more likely to leave Trump behind and declare support for either Biden, or someone else, who is then Biden without mentioning him specifically by name.
They do so because of the arrangement in the United States to vote in many elections on the same ballot.
In this way, the voter can simply label the second category in the Presidential Election Part of the ballot, leaving it as a vote for all the other candidates of that category on the ballot note.
Thus, in another office, the proponents of the Republican Party tempt themselves to withdraw from the sluggish gang of Trump and obtain independent results in the elections.
The Olympic Games of Youth in Dakar Delayed until 2026
The youth’s Olympic Games were scheduled to take place in Dakar next year, which has now been postponed to 2026 due to the chronic epidemic following the agreement of the International Olympic Committee and Senegal.
However, the suspension of the first Olympic Games to take place in Africa is a shock to many young athletes.
Volunteers arrested for the fire in Nantes
A volunteer in Nantes Cathedral, France, has been arrested in connection with fires that destroyed the church.
According to the prosecutor, Le Monde, the suspected fugitive from Rwanda, who served as church overseer, admitted to lighting the fire.
The man’s lawyer, in conversation with another media, says that man sees his actions.
Among those destroyed in the fire were the 17th - century organ and the church’s historic windows.
The volunteer, who is 39 years old but has not been named, was arrested shortly after the end of July 18, but was then released.
He was then returned to a report yesterday, and he was then put in custody.
"No way out of this"
I am well received in the home of Baltasar and Christopher Samper in Copavogi.
The occasion of my visit is the new exhibition of Baltasar and his daughter, Miriam, who will be opened on August 1st at the Litter-Kambi Conservatory on Snæfellsnes.
Is this the first time the fathers show together?
I'm led down to Baltasar's workshop, where I see magnificent paintings.
In the past, large and gloomy pictures of women, but also of flying creatures; eagles on one, shadows of birds on another.
The workroom is out of the house.
"We had a horse here with us that bit the grass," Baltasar told me.
"The horse works much better than a butcher on this hill and hill that we have."
Mireya is with us, Christ and Baltasar, and she tells us how her works speak of the works here.
“Inclusions, blending of paperwork and jewellery.
They're all very white and in contrast to what Dad is doing, because I'm working with the light and stuff," she says.
“ It’s been a year since this idea came up.
Then there were certain works that I was working on and would have wanted to show there, but they were stuck in Tokyo out of Covid.
When my father started painting, and I saw where he was going, I rethinked my party," says Mireya, but Baltasar's work has a strong definition in Icelandic folk tales about women and weeds.
"When I saw that my dad was doing these paintings with the ladies, I thought it was my choice to make jewelry that is related to them," says Mireya, but she works with the Victory of No Bear Son at Sign.
"That's how I put it out of my jewelry."
Last year, Mireya's 72 artists attended the Academy of Sensing on Snæfellsnei, including the Little Kambi Ladder, and found the building fascinating.
“This is a new space, an old barn that’s just finished, ” says Mireya, who talked to a Baldvina Sverrisdódt artist, who suggested that Mireya and Baltasar set up a show.
“ She wanted us both to show, and we thought:
“Why not?
This is a good idea."
Baltasar Samper was born in Spain in 1938 and attended the University of Art in Barcelona before he went on a world tour to study art collections and research.
He came here in Iceland in 1961 and was fascinated by a country and a nation.
He returned here shortly later, met his wife, Kristian, and has lived here continuously since 1963, for 57 years.
Baltasar is a powerful artist, has held dozens of private shows, and shows with the Christian family around us.
He is best known for his large murals, which include a wall decoration in the Flatey Church and a fresco in the Vidstatskirche.
"What influences what I'm doing is the bitch that Iceland has and no other place," Baltasar says.
“ These low suns and these shadows are stretched out and stretched out.
As soon as I got here, I thought, "Wow, here's work."
Mireya is the oldest child of Kristjöna and Baltasars, born in 1964.
“ There was one thing I knew, it was quite clear, that I wasn’t going to be a picture artist, ” she asked if she wanted to follow in her parents ’ footsteps.
“ So I went on a math and natural course in high school and did everything I could to get away from it.
Then I realized I was on the run.
Then you just have to give up," said Mireya and laughed.
She has, like her father, shown in many parts of the world.
A lot in Japan, to make up.
All the children of Baltasar and Christopher have followed the art path.
"I call this virus," says Mireya.
"There was no way out of this."
Count Icelandair has been in grey areas when flight attendants were cancelled
Minister of Social Affairs thinks Icelandair has been in a grey area when the mate broke up with all the girls in the middle of a nuclear reactor.
Then he says he has requested that laws that would prevent firefighters from entering residences be taken for consideration after the Brethren City Bridge.
On July 17th, Icelandair was about to give up all the 38 flight attendants who were working with the partner while the airline’s nuclear affair was still on the board of a government charterer.
The fact that Icelandair had been able to handle these statements was a matter of serious concern and was prepared to settle the matter before the Society.
However, there never came to an end, flying girls and Icelandair got together more than a day after the statements.
However, the Minister of Social Affairs Ausmund Einar Dadason said that in his view, Icelandair was in a grey area and was in the right payroll.
“ My view is that this is a right that should be defended by wage earners.
When you're in a conversation, when you're inside of a peacemaker, it's not an option to go this way.
It is perfectly clear to me that this had not been done.
I think it is quite clear, in my mind, that men had entered into the grey area where this touched," says Ásmundur.
So he won't talk about other companies going the same way as Icelandair.
“You too are now dealing dangerously with the fact that it is only normal to go uplifting this system in order to reduce this right, so I am totally opposed. ”
In the morning, Ásmundur was also asked about the government’s response to the fire at the end of June, at the end of June, where three people died.
The minister now says the study at the level of the House and the Humanities Institute, to which he has direct references.
“ Today’s law states that the fire department should not be allowed to enter an apartment.
I have asked the Ministry of Housing and Humanities to examine in particular whether there is any reason to make any legislative changes.
I am ready to make the changes that need to be made in order to reduce the likelihood that such a thing can happen again," says Ásmundur Einar.
The interview with Ásmund can be listened to as a whole in the player below.
United States reported an increase in pressure on Nord Stream 2 - RT Business News
The U.S. government has made further efforts to force a European company to abandon the gas pipeline project Nord Stream 2, led by Russia, according to World on Sunday, which points to people who are familiar with the issue.
According to the paper, officials of the State Department, the Ministry of Finance, and the Department of Energy of the United States have contacted European contractors to ensure that they are aware of the consequences of continuing the project.
As many as 12 officials should have held at least two online meetings with representatives of enterprises in the last days.
Those who witnessed the talks said that the Americans had stressed in a “friendly ” tone that the United States wanted to prevent Nord Stream 2 from becoming a reality.
“I think it’s a very, very serious threat,” said one dry person to the German media.
These threats are in line with the United States Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo’s statement last week when he warned that companies involved in the project would be best “to get out now” or to risk punishment under 232 of the notorious Law Countering America’s Wonderies Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).
In addition to the Russian energy man Gazprom, who oversees the development of the project, five European companies are involved.
This is the French company Engie, OMV from Austria, the British-Dutch Shell company in addition to Wintershall and Uniper from Germany.
In a conversation with the World on Sunday, a representative of the last - named company said that the efforts of the United States to undermine “high - quality infrastructure projects ” were a clear intervention in the European empire.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Bureau approved a change to the law on national defence, which aims to extend the US sanctions against companies participating in the deployment of the Russian North Stream 2 gas pipeline.
According to one of the legal agents, it may be directed at companies that pay for or provide ships, insurance, port status or service to such ships, as well as those who offer a witness to Nord Stream 2.
Both European companies and public officials have repeatedly expressed their disapproval of US initiatives to trade in European energy by resorting to sanctions against Nord Stream 2, and some of them have even called for Brussels to work as a cooperative.
Moscow officials have also critically criticized Washington’s action and have called it unfair competition.
Earlier in the week, President Dmitry Peskov, said that Russia would set up a new plan on how the project will be completed if the Washington authorities were to keep the new sanctions under pressure.
Preparing to move public institutions to a country
The Minister of Social Affairs and Children is planning to transfer more public institutions to the country in the near future.
In the fall of the Minister's decision, the Ministry's research department has previously declared that they do not intend to move north.
Mr. Ásmundur Einar Daðason, Minister of Social Affairs and Childhood, said in a bombardment on the wave this morning that it was important for the countryside that public institutions were brought there.
Therefore, there is a lot of valuable creation that also creates diversity.
“ It’s nationally important, we’re trying to build up all around the country.
The construction of a job, a cost-reimbursing structure, whether in tourism, agriculture, industry, some natural resource, and this kind of public service activity are very well supported for their construction," says Ásmundur.
"Creating increasing diversity, creating better support under this resource utilisation and the creation of the nation."
The decision to transfer the Office's fire department has been strongly criticised by its staff and by the National Association of Fire and Medical Transporters.
Six people who have knowledge of fires and work in the department are all living in the capital area and are not planning to move any of them to the South Africa.
“ I think it’s quite clear that it’s a political exchange of views on how hard this should be done.
My opinion is, and has always been, that we should take drastic action to distribute public service more effectively," says Ásmundur.
“We see that our neighboring nations, Norwegians and Danir have been doing this successfully.”
He is convinced that the vast majority of the nation wants to see greater distribution of public institutions across the country.
"I think it is necessary to make further political decisions on the transfer of public services to the country, as I was doing with the Ministry of Housing and Human Resources."
He is taking examples of the transfer of food agencies to Selfoss, Iceland's surveyors to Akranes and unemployment insurance to Skaga Beach.
“ Today, it is a place of work in Skagerdam that is of great importance to that community.
I think we should take another step into this creature."
“ I’m preparing a further step in this creature.
More transport."
Fifty-thousand arrests in Seattle
Systematic racism and the U.S. president’s decision to send federal police forces to cities to kill riots was protested many times yesterday.
Fifty Protestants were arrested in Seattle.
The Seattle police used explosives and pepper sprays in large protests yesterday described by the police as riotous.
21 policemen were injured, and at least 45 protesters were arrested.
Two months later, protests against systematic racism began in the United States after the death of a policeman named George Floyd.
The blast was for the protests to demonstrate a consensus between Protestants in Portland.
There has been an exorbitant conflict between police and Protestants since the United States president sent in unthanked authorities the U.S. police forces who have driven unmarked cars.
Thousands met in Portland this weekend, using police tear gas and rubber bullets as a bridge between them and Protestants.
A miracle child of 47 years was observed
The American real - life star Kenya Moore is doing well by strengthening people who need technological fertilization.
Moore, who is known for his participation in the Real Housewives of Atlanta, had his first child 47 years of age after the technological fertilization and called his daughter the miracle child.
“ Almost all my life was waiting to have a baby,” said Moore during an interview with the People.
"As I knew the anguish that people feel, especially women feel, I could possibly not have a child."
Moore realized that she was running out at the age of 40.
“ I didn’t want to have a baby alone.
I didn't want to be a single mother.
So I waited and waited for 40, and I looked up and thought my god good," said Moore, who, however, didn't know his father until she was 46 years old.
One year later, they had a daughter.
The real - life star says his daughter is a miracle child in more ways than one.
In addition to Moore’s being older than most of her firstborn, her daughter came into the world one and a half months before her seat day.
Moore went to a difficult emperor’s cut and took much longer than a conventional emperor’s cut.
“ I call her the miracle baby because it was a child that everyone said was virtually no chance for me to have, ” said Moore during the interview.
Fathers arrested in Mizoram with worth 15.4 million rupees of heroin
The heroin’s value in the home market was about 15.5 million rupees, and it was smuggled from Myanmar, according to the police.
The man and his son were arrested with 1.9 kg of heroin in the Hnahthial district of Mizoram, near the border with Myanmar, after the police on Sunday.
The heroin’s value in the home market was about 15.5 million rupees, and it was smuggled from Myanmar, according to the police.
Duhkima (62) and his son Remthangpuia (33) were arrested with drugs on Friday night in the village of Ngharchhip, said police.
They also lost some 280 grams of heroin, worth about 1.5 million rupees, when they swam across, on their flight from the police, to the office.
According to police information, this is considered to be one of the largest quantities of heroin in the state.
The defendants were brought to trial under appropriate articles on drugs and hallucinogenic drugs (NDPS) from 1985.
Even if a national border between the states and Myanmar is closed because of the siron virus epidemic, there is no drug or other commodity smuggling, as reported by the police.
The Assam officers recently seized 25 transported trucks that were smuggled from Myanmar, but their worth is about 40 million rupees.
A doctor ran 20 miles [35 km] with a mask
The British doctor Tom Lawton ran over 35 kilometres of the day with a face mask to show that oxygen saturation was not reduced when using masks.
Lawton, a doctor at Bradford Royal Hospital, has worked there while the pandemic has been raging.
To disprove the oxygen saturation theory and to encourage people to wear a face mask, Lawton decided to run back to work with a mask.
Before he set out, he set up a collection of GoFindMe for The Trusell Trust, which provides food supplies in Bradford and in many parts of Britain.
“ I am a great supporter of everything that keeps us safe.
That's why I've been in shock about the wrong information that's been coming between people that a face mask reduces oxygen saturation in people," said Lawton.
Lawton said that he had previously competed for three years, but during the pandemic he had suffered.
On Monday’s last day, he ran a mile [35 km].
“ I never took the mask off (no food or drink) and the oxygen saturation became resistant 98% every time I watched, ” wrote Lawton on Twitter at the end of the race.
Prince Jehoakim Still in Hospital
Prince Jehoakim of Denmark is now at the University Hospital in Toulouse, France, and his condition is steady.
The prince underwent a brain surgery yesterday after having been diagnosed with a blood clot.
“ Prince Joakim’s condition is still steady.
The prince blessedly came into the hands of professionals over a period of time and feels well after events.
It's too early to tell us how long he'll be at the hospital right now," says Lene Balleby, a Danish royal hall official, in a written answer to the Danish government radio.
Only a few days have passed since the king’s family celebrated the 18th anniversary of Prince Jehoakim, his next son, Felix.
The anniversary was celebrated at the Queen’s vineyard, Château de Cayx, in Cahors, South France.
The family was still on vacation when Jehoakim was hospitalized yesterday.
Joakim, 51 years old, moved to France last year, where he is studying at the Ecolé Militaire military school, the first of Dana.
Then he works as a defense expert in the Danish embassy in Paris.
The prince's French connection is a strong end to his father, Prince Henry, French and his wife, Princess Mary, as well.

Gottlieb warns that the unbridled spread of the coronal virus in society makes it “very difficult” for schools to open in the fall
Washington — Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former U.S. Food and Drug Administration Chief, warned on Sunday that opening up in a new academic year will be “very difficult” for school, if the Crown Virus is spreading without a doubt within these communities.
“ I believe that local school authorities need to examine the distribution within the community.
If the virus is distributed unobstructed in the community, it will be very difficult to open in that situation," said Gottlieb in the Face the Nation.
Since the autumn break is scheduled to begin next weeks, Trump’s government had urged the authorities to open their schools to students and offer courses at the schools five days a week.
However, these attempts by President Trump and the Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos will come a week after Trump warned that the coronary virus epidemic would likely be “worsier before it gets better ” and confirmed that school practice in those places where the situation is worst may have to be postponed for a few weeks.
Nevertheless, on the fifth day, the Centers for Disease Control provided guidance on how to be safest to open schools for students.
Among other things, these guidelines call for a distance in schools between people who are insured, students, and employees to use facials and for students to be divided into remote groups to reduce the number of infections.
However, the Center for Disease Control did not publish standards for school directors as to when they should close schools if there is a growing number of coronation virus infections, as Gottlieb says, have been “unlucky. ”
“ When this state of uncertainty and precise instructions have not been given about how schools will be opened, ” he says, “I think that more parents will be careful.
“That’s why I think it is very important to find out exactly what the criteria are, which the disease prevention centres did not provide in their guidelines. ”
Gottlieb said that schooling needs to reflect on the rate of positive infection in society, local expansion, and testing when deciding whether schools should be kept open or switched to online teaching.
If between 5 and 10% of the analyses give a positive result, 'the problem is getting worse' but more than 10%, 'the threshold is when careful consideration is needed as to whether to close the school sentence.'
“This is a sign that the epidemic has reached its foothold in society,” said Gottlieb, adding that this would make things of the Florida state, which is the center of the cancer virus epidemic in the United States, difficult to open for school training next month.
Coronary virus infections have increased in more than 30 countries, and Colombia is now in the sunbelt at the southern coast of the United States.
Gottlieb, however, said that there was a sign that there was a slowing down in the number of cases in some countries, including Arizona and Texas.
However, even though Gottlieb had said that there was a “significant sign ” that some states in the sun’s belt had started to slow down, including South Carolina, Alabama, India, and Illinois.
Many governors have set rules that require people to use masks in public spaces and stop the reopening of the colonized virus to detect its spread.
Gottlieb said that states should consider closing bars, limiting the number of people in restaurants, closing movie houses, and other places that offer indoor entertainment, and setting rules on masking to overcome the epidemic, which are measures that make it possible for governments to avoid taking back the strict restrictions imposed at the beginning of the epidemic in March.
In addition to the use of masks by various countries, various companies have forced people to use facials.
McDonald's quick-bitter is the newest company to make use of face-defenses compulsory and therefore adds to a group of companies like Walmart, Starbucks and others who have set their own rules on masking.
Gottlieb said that he assumed that more companies would assume a masky duty with him, especially since the danger is considered to be great.
“If we can really control the epidemic when winter goes on until we get a vaccine or some kind of treatment that changes the clinical course of this disease, we can do it with masks, it’s relatively simple, something we can all do but that doesn’t change our lives and allows us to keep things that are very important to us, like keeping some companies open and bringing the kids back to school,” he says.
Although Donald Trump did not say last week that he wanted to use masks in the entire country, he urged the Americans last week to use facials and told the White House’s news conference that “they had an effect. ”
Wilfried Zaha wants to leave Crystal Palace, says Roy Hodgson, "It's news to expect."
The members of the Crystal Palace received a call for the summer when Roy Hodgson, CEO of the company, declared that he wanted to leave the company.
The elephant has been playing at Selhurst Park for more than five years and seems now to be leaving, but he has previously been spoken at teams like Arsenal and Bayern Munich.
Since he is now 27 years old, he will see whether a team in that quality group is still willing to pay high sums for him, especially at the financial uncertainty of the sport this summer, after a period in which Zaha scored four limits and made five supports for the Palace team that caused a few disappointments.
In an interview with Alex Crook at TalkSport after the last game of the season, Hodgson said that “the news is to be expected” about the possible departure of Zaha after confirming that the candidate had “made it clear” that he saw his future elsewhere than that of the associate.
There are still three years left by the applicant’s contract with Palace, and in the past year, the partner indicated that 100 million sterlings would need to coexist with him.
The Hodgson period ended with seven consecutive losses and a smooth period on the last day of the period, which led to the death of the team to the 14th place.
Zaha found the net musk only once from mid - December to the end of the period with a long shot in the loss against Chelsea.
It was reported that he had asked for a sale last summer when he tried to get away from the partner but no offer was made to tempt the Palace to sell.
Zaha changed the commissioner in January, apparently to increase the chances of getting out of the company, and in the next few weeks it will be without a doubt in his first place to secure a social union.
Zaha is the player who played most of the minutes in the original English section of the Palace during the season and was the only player of the team under the age of 28 who played 1100 minutes or more, showing how much reconstruction the team could need to attack with the funds available to the player.
Hurricane Hanna: The colonized Texas state is facing a great risk of floods in 'dual shells'.
In southern Texas after the hurricane Hanna reached the country twice and resulted in heavy rains and wind gusts of up to 40 yards [40 m] per second.
When he reached a beach on Saturday, he was classified as a first-degree storm (bottom of a five-degree scale) and he has now been brought down to a tropical storm, but rain could still numerate 150-300 mm on Sunday and wind could reach 26 meters per second.
In some areas rain has already reached up to 230 mm, including Cameron County at the border of Mexico.
Hanna was the first hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean in 2020, and meteorologist Chris Birchfield advised the residents to be on guard: “This is not nearly over yet, and we are still expecting floods. ”
In the past few weeks, Texas has struggled with a large increase in coronation virus transmission.
The governor Greg Abbott issued a disaster report to 23 agencies that are on the way to the storm, including Harris, Fort Bend, Galveston, and Brazoria.
“ All hurricanes are an enormous challenge.
This challenge is complex and even more difficult as the hurricane passes through areas that have become worse because of the COVID-19," said Greg.
The hurricane first landed at 5 p.m. on Saturday, 25 miles [24 km] north of Port Mansfield, about 200 miles [210 km] south of Corpus Christi.
The second time was not far away, in the eastern part of Kennedy County.
More than 43,700 people in South Texas, including Corpus Christi, Harlingen and Brownsville, were without electricity on Saturday night.
An emergency service in Corpus Christi set up a garden near a street junction in order to be able to use it if there is a crossing of the streets.
U.S. president Donald Trump said at once that the government was watching Hannah and Douglas, a hurricane heading toward Hawaii in the Pacific.
Sherry Boehme, who lives at the beach in Corpus Christi, said that the approaching storm had increased the anxiety she felt about the pandemic.
This 67 - year - old woman had mostly stayed at home because of health problems associated with chronic lung disease.
She said: “It’s almost like a double blow to us.
I think a lot of people are nervous.
We'll get through this.
It's all good and strong and together."
Heyjacking on the South Sea Blowing Sailing
In the South, the weather has been exceptionally favourable for farmers during the summer.
Most have a first strike, another slaughter is far off, and then it is expected that some will reach the third strike at the end of the summer.
The weather has been playing with local farmers like other people in the country during the summer and has not spoiled the land on the farm.
So listening has gone well.
Victory, son of August, a cow farmer in the Birtingaholic in Hrunnamann, and a white - eyed contractor is happy and happy.
“ Yes, it’s just been doing great, I think farmers just have to be broke, it’s been going fine because they’ve been very good weather the last half of the month.
Heyin is the very good end of the harvest good and the quality of the ears nice all over," says Victor.
The winner says that it is growing, especially in cows, that they live in flats or outlying areas, which have been given very well, but it is a long time to do so.
“ It’s lively, yes, it’s actually been very comfortable for the last half of the month or three weeks, it’s been so dry and good, and then it’s so comfortable to deal with it.
It all remembers, there is less stress and can be stored until morning at times what could be done today, so it is wonderfully comfortable.
But does Victor think that some farmers will strike three times?
“ Yes, I could quite believe it, those who were first.
We started on June 17th, it could be that those who were first had to take three times something."
This is how they prevent the injury.
The edgeman Adama Traoré, who plays with Wolves in the English league, is an enormously fast player.
His adversaries have caused him to take action to prevent him from missing them.
This has resulted in his shoulder falling several times out of joint, but now the wolves have come with a solution to the problem.
The Sun reports.
Wolves game against Crystal Palace allowed the paramedics to lubricate something on the shoulders of Traoré.
“This is something we had to do to protect Traoré, ” says a writer in Wolves, but what was being carried on was baby oil.
“ Making him a sniper makes it harder for defenses to catch him, and that is how we can prevent further injury. ”
His shoulder Traoré first fell out of the team when Wolves played against Tottenham in December.
Since then, the shoulder has dropped out of the team four times, most recently against Sheffield United earlier this month.
News of Harry England Prince: The Duke’s friend protests claims in a new book that has been between the teeth of people
Stott told Sky News that the contents of the book about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were in no way different from the fabric of gossip, the only difference being that the book was bound up.
The former soldier wants to see more and more directly the positive things that his or her husband and wife have done, such as their charitable work.
Stott said: “I don’t feel anything different from what we read in gossip, except now in an inspired book. ”
"There's a storyteller there, but there's no record of it coming from them."
"I think it's just one more attack on them, just like the gossip magazines that persecute them."
“ I realize that they are in the spotlight and people want to know what they are doing, but I wanted it to be more focused on all the good things they have done and their charity rather than their personal issues. ”
"Of course, they will never get away from it, because of their position."
The Duke’s and Duchess of Sussex shone at the other members of the royal family, as a result of an expert in the royal family’s history.
Dr. Kate Williams told Sky News that the royal family had failed to take advantage of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s astrology.
She added that the rule of power within the royal family was permanent, but it was not possible to control the public interest.
She also said: “The evidence is that everything they did in support of the queen tended to overshadow the other members of the king’s family, and that was considered a problem. ”
"They're very popular."
“They had less weddings than most siblings in the same position, Andrew had a huge wedding, Anne also had a huge wedding. ”
“But while Harry and Meghan’s wedding was smaller in size than that of Vilhjalmi and Katrina, the news of it was as much because of the world’s interest in the couple.”
Donald Trump admits that he often looks after his voice on Twitter
Donald Trump has admitted that he often regrets his entries on Twitter that fuel war.
In an interview with Barstool Sports on Friday, the president of the United States said that his unsolicited reintroduction of Twitter material — some of which have contained material from the white racial mind — would cause him the most trouble.
When journalist Dave Portnoy asked him if he would see for his notes, Trump replied: “Often, too often.
It was so in the old days, before this came, that you wrote a letter and said that this letter was very large.
You put it on your desk, and then you came back the next day and said, "Oh, how glad I am that I didn't send it," right?
But we don't do it with Twitter.
We send it out right away, we feel great, and then you get a phone call — “Did you really say that? ”
I say, "What is this?" and you find out something."
Last month, Trump caused a great deal of anger after re-establishing an entry (shared material from another account) with a video of his supporters in the Villages area of Florida, where an elderly couple called "White Power!" or "White Power".
And in 2017, Trump re-issued three entries directed against Muslims, published by Jaydu Fransen, the leader of the rightwing party of Britain First.
The president told Portnoy that the restorations that would have caused him the most trouble
Trump said: “You see something that looks good and doesn’t investigate it, you understand, and you don’t know exactly what the helmet says, which is a little bit and you don’t enlarge it, sometimes — I’ve found that it’s almost always the reintroduction that gets you in trouble. ”
The president often commends himself, boasts of his opposers, and the conspiracy with his 80 million followers on Twitter.
Trump says Twitter helps him to get through the so - called “fals ” on television shows and newspapers, which he says are perplexed by untruth.
However, the President’s own lies have often come under the spotlight, and now Twitter means Trump’s entries as a misappropriator.
The GPS system may be insecure
Many countries are working to develop a different location technique from the GPS system.
According to an engineer, there may be reason to worry about the safety of the GPS system, which is owned by the U.S. Army.
The old Loran system has been restored to life.
The GPS technology will follow us every step of the way.
We use it when we fly, sail, and drive, at surveying, in industry, and on vacation.
Most people do not think that it is a military device owned by the U.S. Army, which first opened it for public use in the 1980 ’ s.
GPS technology uses satellite coordinates at 20,000 miles [20,000 km] above ground, so natural conditions have little effect on it.
“ But it’s very easy to interrupt it.
And malicious people can easily interfere with the reception of these marks," says Sæmundur E. Thorsteinsson, professor of engineering at Iceland University, and expert on risk management and security of communications.
He also says that it is easy to send false error signals, such as in warfare.
“The GPS system is owned by the US Department of Defence.
They have assured the public that the system is ready at all times.
But certainly they can turn this off if it plunged into the head of the very wise president to do such a thing, then he could probably do it," said Zemundur.
Thus, many nations have become aware of other systems and localities.
Both the Russians and the Chinese are working on their own satellite system, and the European Union is deflecting the Galileo site system.
“The Galileo system is primarily built for civil use.
It may be more accurate and naturally under the control of the European Union.
Then it is not one government that completely rules it but many," says Mr. Zemundur.
But many are also looking back at the old larynx technology.
It is based on radio waves and was used from the 1960s until the GPS technology took over.
The Loran-marks are sent on very long waves from the transmitters down to the ground.
“It is then a new version of the Loran system called eLoran, which stands for Enhanced Loran, that people are serious about looking at it in many countries to have it as a system of defense, because it seems a bit different to the law of disrupting it, it is far more difficult than disturbing the satellite system,” says Zeemundur.
However, it is most likely that it is safest to have access to as most location systems.
Senator Vern Buchanan's experienced employee killed by the coronin virus
“Gary was a professional in the fingertips and a loyal servant of the public, ” said Buchanan on Facebook.
“ He touched the lives of so many and was loved and admired by those who knew him.
I will never forget how refreshing he was, the sense of humor, and the joy of helping others."
The Buchanan’s office published a statement at the beginning of the month that stated that Tibbett had no recent contact with others in the office.
Tibbett, who worked outside the office, had worked for Buchanan since 2011.
Florida has reported 414.511 cases from the beginning of the pandemic, which is more than the cases of 411,200 in New York, as reported by health authorities in the United States.
The government’s data show that hospitalization has increased by 79% from the U.S. national festival day, July 4.
The data also show that at least 50 Florida intensive care units reached their peak on Saturday.
"We were informed that this could have an effect," said DeSantis in June.
“ At the same time, police work and supporting it could have a negative effect. ”
Flight from the Horn to the Cape Town
Dwarf doves, rosestars, doves, doves, doves, glass cans, and tears are among the birds that have wandered down here for the summer.
The Birds ’ Web site of the Southeast African Birds.is provides a brief daily news of the intrigues, where they have been observed and at times their gender.
They're a lot of bird lovers in Iceland.
To this end, the number of people who like the Facebook page Icelandic bird species can be mentioned.
The members of the group number some 14,600.
There are divided images of birds and it is obvious that Iceland is rich in good photographers who have the patience needed to form birds.
Brynjölf's son is one of them.
In fact, as he is called, there is a staff member of the Fuglat Centres of the South East and the Naturburst of the South East, and they closely monitor the bird life in that area.
He speaks nicely of these animals that enrich the life of Iceland and play an important role there, and then it doesn't matter whether the bird is a big and big predator or a small sparrow.
The Fugrate Research Centre was founded in 2005 on the anniversary of the Hälfdán Björnsson in the Kryskekers in the region of Örea, with the aim of sustaining and continuing the significant natural research that he conducted from 1940 onwards.
“ Half-dead was thirteen years old when he began to feed information on birds, ” says Brynjulf in a conversation with the Core.
“We at the bird inspection station are not doing exactly what Half-dead did but are building on his data by counting and marking birds.”
A farmer and a common scientist, born on March 14, 1927.
He wrote numerous research articles on plants, insects, and bird life.
He died on February 10, 2017, less than nine years of age.
Half a dozen and his siblings in the Kwikkers became interested in many of the people who came to know them about Icelandic nature.
This group includes Björn Gísli Arnarson, the “other employee” of the Fuglat Centre.
Bear grew up in the Reynoval Valley, South Africa, and he received ample natural sustenance from his neighbors, the Half Death of the Kwikkers.
What, though, is it really the case with the Fuglat Memorial Center in the South East?
By March 20, each year, the Birds ’ Reconnaissance Centre sets up a special bird’s nest in Einarsunden, a treelike dose inside Port of Hornaforth.
Standard meanings are made on the birds that enter the Internet.
The nets are taken down around May 10 when the laying time begins.
The nets are up every day, at least from about six o'clock in the morning and past noon.
And they need to be visited every hour.
The birds that come into them are marked, measured, and then released back into freedom.
Every hour, a journalist asks a wonder.
“Yes, we share this with ourselves, me and Buffet.
Since we now have to work for ourselves, this can be a lot of puzzles, but somehow we manage to do it," says Brynjulf.
The Internet is then reestablished between August 1 and November 10 — all the days allowed by weather.
Between guarding the nets and seasonings that they do not have, Brynjulf and Björn are marking wares, foams, and various mosquitoes where they reach them.
In addition, they take on a number of special tasks.
One of these projects is carried out in cooperation with the Icelandic Institute of Natural Sciences and is about collecting forest mites of birds.
“ The forest mite jumps at the birds at their winter stations and then goes with them to the shore in the spring.
This happens shortly before they set off, and therefore these ticks are not big when they come to Iceland.
Then he jumps off the bird and tries to find himself another host when he needs it."
But enough for ticks.
Asked how the birds in the southeastern country felt this summer, Brynjulf says that the lay of the crane seems to be going well — where it over the head is laying.
“ The world of the war here is at Hala, South, and everything is going well.
But it is not a lay-off to find any longer at the Jakull harlon, where a few years ago there was a huge laying."
He says that a few years ago, more than a thousand crickets were thrown there, but now they can be counted on the fingers of another.
“As we look at mowing and wading birds, it seems to me that it has diminished in the last few years what you find out about them.
But of course there's always a change between years."
According to Brynjölf, what can explain that change is probably about food supply.
"It's all about food."
Man’s works can also have their origins in birds and other animals.
Some birds, though, seem to be doing a lot of good in the South East this summer.
"One of the things that I think is good is to choose to grow again after great depression," says Brynjulf, "but during the past years and decades, the foam has fallen terribly."
Of sparrows, it seems that the marionage is going to do well in summer, as in the previous year.
Wooden threshings and dufties had decreased somewhat, but Brynjulf says it doesn’t show until the fall of this summer how it happened to them.
But let's turn to the intrigues.
They often draw great attention, especially if they are very rare and even colorful.
These two interesting elements are about one of the most popular in the summer: The Rosary.
"Others have been relatively quiet in the tangles," says Brynjulf, but mentioning that in the country there is now a crying twig and then a ring dove has been seen and is starting to work here.
When Brynjulph and Björn get to grips with intruders, they also mean them, just as other birds do.
Labels are international, and they are practiced worldwide.
There are signs, such as the winter stations of birds, where they are laying, and their routes.
“ It’s even possible to see how long they’re on the move,” notes Brynjulf.
These data are useful in many ways, for the development of epidemics such as avian influenza.
"There is always an increase in knowledge."
If anyone in the world finds a bird that has been marked by the Fuglaat Research Centre South-East, the information is sent to Iceland's Natural Sciences Institute.
“We’ve been reclaimed from Cape Town in South Africa.
There we found a crayon that we had labeled.
One of us was later found in the United States."
One bird is the Brynjulf especially thoughtful, and it is the foam.
“ The foam is our bird, ” he says, pointing out that the Fuglat Centre and its South-East Nature Office are tasked with observing his offspring — which has become quite smooth and now he is on the list.
It is difficult to say what caused a collapse in the founding, but one theory is that the foam has made itself a sea catch that was once thrown out of fishing vessels and into the sea for good, but that it is now much better used and affecting the foam.
Are you at the best spot in the country to watch birds?
“ Of course you don’t make me say no, ” says Brynjulf laughing, adding: “Since we’re also following intruders, we probably have to go out there. ”
But surely the South East is special when it comes to a bird’s life.
“This area is like a migration into the country from Europe, and then the birds are scattered from here.
To be here looking at birds and eccentric birds is very interesting, but here is less to be found of birds of prey than in many other parts of the country.
It is not far from the distance, from the distance, to the distance of the sea, so that the area which it is suitable for bird inspection."
But on Brynjulf's favorite bird?
He thinks about it a short time before he answers.
That's a tough question.
“A bowy nose is my bird’s end, ” he finally answers, “I have found nine out of the ten seen in the land.
“I now find one of the most fun pictures of horse stories to be taken.
It's always nice to find birds that haven't been seen before in the country or are rare, so I'm not talking about finding a new species for Europe."
But both of them have done so.
If you would like to pay more attention to Binna and Böss at Fuglita thought centre South-East, you can observe their work on Facebook and the Birds web site.
Saudi Arabia — The Sun’s Coast of the Future? No alcohol or bikini
The tourism industry has grown enormously throughout the world in recent years, and now the authorities in Saudi Arabia want their share of the cake.
Consider, for example, the destruction of some 60,000 billion Icelandic dollars to create a tourist paradise in the land.
The Guardian reports this.
But this tourist paradise will not be in the style that our Icelandic people should get used to in southern Europe.
Alcohol will not be available, and women will not be allowed to swallow themselves in bikinium.
How, then, should tourists be lured into this strangulation - religious Islamic country?
This is to be done, for example, by building a new city where white beaches, moons (of course made up of men), drone taxis, and robots that serve people.
The Guardian says it's Mohammed bin Salman, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia who wants to invest in this investment.
Of course, the money will have to be picked up in the oily land.
The Crown Prince says that there is no discussion that women can avoid covering shoulders and knees in public places but admit that creating a tourist paradise in the country is not easy because it is too hot when the sun is high in the air and cannot be relied on for wind.
But you may wonder, ‘ If they cannot buy alcohol, they will not also be disinterested in future travelers. ’
Mr Francois Bozize, formerly adjourned by the Presidency of the Central African Republic, announced the
The former president of the Central African Republic, Francois Bozize, who had been thrown down by a chair, announced on Saturday that he would present himself in the presidential elections in December, despite the fact that the United Nations is using sanctions and that a warrant for arrest was issued for his alleged crimes against humanity.
He announced his presentation in front of a large group of supporters of his class, Kwa na Kwa (working, only work), in Bangui, capital.
In 2013, this 73 - year - old general and military commander were defeated in the rebellion of the League of Nations, the largest Muslim rebels from the north who plunged the nation, the majority of whom are Christians, into violent civil war and a severe and prolonged humanitarian crisis.
"The country needs a man with experience, peace and conviction," said Bozize in a speech critical of the current president's office, Faustin-Archange Touadera.
Bozize first took office after the election in 2003 and became president for 10 years before he fled the country in 2013.
The new government sought to arrest him for alleged crimes against mankind and for encouraging genocide, but he has not been arrested since his return from exile in the past year.
It is not clear how the order of arrest or foreign acts of punishment affects his presentation.
In January, Bozize said that he would ask the United Nations to remove the punishments imposed in 2014 for alleged support of armed Christian groups of Anti-balaka.
Touadra is currently steering the country with the support of the vast peacekeeping force of the United Nations, which numbers more than 13,000 military and police officers.
He was elected in 2016, and he is expected to make his offer in a different season, but his presentation has not been confirmed.
The first round of elections will be December 27.
In February 2019, the government signed a peace agreement with 14 armed groups who generally claim to defend the interests of certain communities or religions.
Since then, violent crime has been reduced, but it is still the case that bloodguilty incidents are usually caused by conflicts over resources, but the majority of this diamond - rich country is not under the government’s control.
Violence has forced more than 1.5 million people to flee their homes.
Gareth Bale's position at Real Madrid is 'unacceptable to everyone', says Toni Kroos
Toni Kroos, the center of Real Madrid, says Gareth Bale’s position in the Spanish team “is unacceptable to everyone. ”
Bale did not participate in any of the last seven games of the team and he participated little in the LaLiga celebration of Los Blancos, and now in the summer there is the plight that the player intends to keep still and let his contract slip out, but the partner hopes that he will disappear on the track.
“There is no way to avoid unacceptable situations for everyone,” said Kroos on the Lauschangriff Endlich, mit Sport.
“ He wasn’t bought to play as little as he is now.
In fact, I think he wanted to leave the company last summer and that the partner had actually said 'yes' but then said 'no' later.
I don't know if he's still a little angry about it.
When asked if the circumstances had negatively affected the atmosphere at Real, Croos said: “Not as much as you would expect.
I've known him for six years, and we've worked a lot of important things together."
Chinese give Reykjan City 2,000 face masks to support the fight against the coronae virus
Chinese missionary Jin Zhijian handed over two thousand face masks to the town’s mayor, Reykjan City, over a week ago.
The reason was the visit of the mayor to the Chinese Embassy on July 22, 1990.
Weird news first reported.
On the occasion of his visit to the city manager, he paid a return visit to the Chinese ambassador’s town of Reykjanes, where he visited the town hall and met with the mayor.
Reports Vics report that there was talk of promoting friendly cooperation between Reykjan City and Xianyang City, but the local communities began their cooperation between 2014 and 2014.
The gift, 2,000 facial masks, is rooted in this friendly community collaboration, but the mayors of Xianyang wanted to give a mask and thus support the fight against the coronation virus epidemic.
According to the report of Vicnar, the masks will be used in sensitive institutions and local Reykjan towns for both employees and other visitors.
In the accompanying picture you can see in addition to the flags of Iceland and the People's Republic of China, the inscription on the face mask box, which says "Ber is who behind, except for a brother who doesn't."
Thomsen wants to leave KR - Calculating to lower your salary
Tobias Thomsen is going to try to get home to Denmark, from the Iceland KR, next month and says he's interested from the Danish 1st Division.
Thomsen has been playing in Iceland since 2017 and has become Iceland champion with both Val and KR.
On the other hand, this 27 - year - old visitor says he misses Danmarkt and wants to move there with his girlfriend, Stefanie Jakobsdaughter.
Danan's contract with KR is valid until the end of this season, so it is clear that a Danish company would have to negotiate with KR for a purchase price to get it in August, before a new season begins in Denmark.
Otherwise, Thomsen would have to wait until the winter by coming to Denmark.
“ Yes, I know the Danish units will start again at the end of August.
That means, of course, that I would have to cancel my contract with KR-ings, but I've told them that I miss Danmarks, and they have a full understanding of it," said Thomsen to ball.dk.
He added that he had a very good relationship with the Rúnar Kristinsson Coach, who had shown full understanding of the situation, and Thomsen said he did not think that the purchase price would be a big problem.
“ I have also had conversations with two 1st Branches after that department finished and the team knew where they would end.
There's been a little bit of interest already in the coming period so it might be good that I go to Denmark before the Icelandic division stops," said Thomsen but added that it was clear that there were not many companies in Denmark that could buy up his contract with KR.
“ It’s not quite clear now, but it’s been an interest.
I also need to find the best chance for me and my girlfriend, who is from Iceland and comes with me.
This depends on a few things," said Thomsen, saying, "looking first at the Copenhagen harbour.
Thomsen said KR-ingen doesn't have to worry that he wouldn't give himself all to practice and play, even though he missed Danmark.
“ CR knows what it gets from me, and it’s that I do things 100 percent.
I can totally overlook the fact that I miss Danmarks when I'm in practice or in games," said Thomsen, who says that he's going to lower his salary by leaving Iceland's championships in the second division of Denmark.
“ I’ll probably have to lower my wages only because of the coronal virus crisis that seems to have rocked the Danish companies a little more than they do.
But I am also in a study, and one solution might be that a company provided me with a job.
Most of the members of the 1st Division have an agreement with the sponsors.
I'm learning sports management through the playthings and I'm finishing the bachelor class," said Thomsen.
Thomsen has only been in the starting team of KR in two games at Pepsi Max during this season, but has been on record for five games and scored one goal.
He started 21 games for the last year and scored seven points.
KR is equal to Selection to the points at the top of Pepsi Max Division and at the game for good, but the team will show up in Akureyri today.
Fighting through the rooster virus on board a bus as a driver gets into a hot argument about masks
The video shows passengers and drivers on board an Arriva bus in Liverpool handling masks.

The driver said: “It’s not my job to tell everyone who steps up to the bus to use a mask. ”
Witnesses said this about the incident: “A man and an older woman began to see her, and much controversy broke out. ”
“ The driver had to get out of his seat and came to ask what was really going on, and he told one woman she wasn’t even using the mask right. ”
"That woman then rushed out of the bus and said she was going to report the incident."
Arriva’s spokesman said: “The security of our customers and employees is our priority.
“Our customers are obliged to use masks when using public transport (exceptional).”
"Explanatory guidelines and meanings for customers on this and all other distance rules are on board the bus, the community media and our website."

Octavia Spencer reports that Hollywood recruits people with disabilities more often in role
The playwright participates in a new campaign to increase the participation of people with disabilities in the entertainment sector.
The campaign is under way at the same time as 30 years have passed since the adoption of American law on the rights of people with disabilities, which is due on Sunday.
In the video, Spencer discusses the importance of seeing themselves and their lives realistically reflected on the screen.
“Nothing can replace personal experience and real films, ” she says.
“This is why it is so important to recruit an appropriate actor for an appropriate role.”
Spencer discussed the effects she had of seeing skin - black people on the screen when she was a little girl watching the “Good Times. ”
The components shown at CBS between 1974 and 1979 were made by Norman Lear, and they rocked the road as the first plays to show two parents of both African backgrounds.
Organisation against hunger push Yoho aside after an incident in the House of Commons
WASHINGTON (AP) — Regardless of the Christian organization that wants to end hunger, on Saturday they said that they had asked Senator Ted Yoho to resign from the leadership of the organization, and that he had suffered as they called the “attack” of Senator Alexandri Ocasio-Cortez.
Ocasio-Cortez, Senator Demokrata of New York, accused Yoho, Congressman of the Republic of Florida, of using low-pitched and male-trafficking slogans when he rebuked her when they met on the stairs of the House of Commons last Monday.
Yoho claimed that he had not used the words quoted, but a reporter who testified that the incident confirmed that the phrase had been as she described it.
Bread for the World stated that the organization had met Yoho on Friday and sought to say that he was “righteous to our commitment to living with women and people who are skin-dark, domestically and globally, leading us to the world with increased participation of all races and increased justice. ”
On the Bread for the World website, the “co - Christian voice ” of them pressed the Senate and the government to end hunger in the land and worldwide.
“ Where Bread for the World is independent of Christian organizations whose goal is to reduce hunger and poverty with a solid public policy, the organization is upholding the respect, dignity and concern that Jesus asks us to show when dealing with people in positions of power, wherever they are in the political spectrum, ” says the statement.
“Our assessment reflects recent actions and the words of Senator Ted Yoho, reported in the media, not the moral requirements of our members of the government.”
At the time of the proceedings, Yoho had not responded to an e - mail with an invitation to respond.
In an incredible speech in the House of Commons last Thursday, Ocasio-Cortez, in a dramatic manner, said about the incident and directed his words against what she called a men's reunion, which "accepts violence and violent speech against women".
More than a dozen of her associates agreed that the incident was an example of all too common men.
Yoho described the incident as a brief discussion of policy and that “no one had been bothered, bullied or attacked. ”
He said that he regrets having shown a “treasure attitude. ”
The 30-year-old Ocasio-Cortez is in his first period as a progressive senator and has received both praise and burdens for her cleansing.
At the end of his fourth election period, aged 65, Yoho is one of the most conservative members of the council and will sit in a holy stone.
Wait until 98 minutes in the room by scoring the first goal of the season

Players of Real Madrid are exempt from the rules on sickness
Zinedine Zidane and his disciples in Real Madrid will be able to come to England in their second match at Manchester City, Europe’s Mosterparticipation, without having to suffer a two - week illness.
The British government has decided that travelers from Spain will have to undergo a two - week disease to control the spread of the corona virus.
There are exceptions, however, as in the case of teams at the highest level of sport.
This confirmed a team of athletes at Sky Sports.
The Authority states that those who are exempt from the rules will be in restricted areas only, at the door.

The victory will continue in the 8th finals in Portugal.
Outcast rain and subdued over the land by the Saints of Commerce
News from overcrowded hotels and tent areas to judge, in the smallest part of the south, is clear that Iceland has been able to travel domestically this summer.
At the same time, those who have landed have had great success with weather and weather forecasting DV agree that the summer has only been declared cleanly beautiful, to at least this time.
But now, shopping weekends that have been the biggest weekend of the year.
However, as compared with other weekends, it is unclear how it will be this year, for events that have led a great number of people to fail to be held in the usual year.
There, for example, is enough to mention a national festival.
The weather will, of course, play a major role, but now it looks like a rainstorm all over the country, but especially the south and southwest.
The weather room predicts a rainstorm from Thursday night and at least Saturday night.
It should be noted that long - term predictions are not sacred truth here on the North Atlantic and are likely to make changes.
The meteorologist tucked Einar the son of Sveinbjörn in his prediction of his weather tissue, Bliku, that it is low to expect of the halls of the merchants.
Says him: A slump in the sky with a cold that too often also reaches down to the surface, leads to the arrival of warm, southwestern air that only grows low with wind and wind.
Of course, there is also a warm air that “glows ” across the north.
To support his prophecy, Einar says: “A small wave from America goes east and with it a summerlike air.
As she approaches, she reaches out for “blossoming ” the form of a lowering of air pressure and a considerate summer drop. ”
The great prediction, the European Central System of Accounts to the left of the map, and the U.S.
The separation of the valley is prophesied late on Thursday and early on Friday with heavy A-thread and rain on most of the land.
The medicinal product label of 985 hPa will then be followed.
This time, there is some warm air in the North and East on Saturday and even Sunday as well.
However, it could blow with it.

Followed a actress from Law and Order all the way to New York
"I was shot in her like a man getting so young," says Birna Rönn Björnsdóttir of Mariska Hargitay, the leading actress of the Law and Order: Special Victims Unit.
She was so disgusted by the actress that she showed up at the stage and waited for her for hours together, just to be able to say hi.
When Birna Rönn Björnsdóttir, owner of the Pink Iceland Travel Office, looked like many Icelandic residents on the Law and Order: Special Victims Unit from the turn of the century, she colted for the principal actress of the Mariska Hargitay.
Birna tells the story of her meetings and of her actress in the Aesthetories of Law 1.
When Birna himself was a teenager, at the age when many people began to develop violent love shots, she did not experience it like her peers because she was struggling to suppress her own feelings.
She thought she was interested in boy bands and young magical movie - making heartknuts, but she didn’t have it at all.
“ I was cutting pop sheets and hanging pictures on the wall of Backstreet boys and Jared Leto.
But there was nothing behind it, it was just me hiding that I was a lesbian."
She says that sometimes it is said that when people come out of the closet, they go through a late age.
“ We spend our teen years suppressing these teenage whims, these shots, and stuff.
I think it was one of the things that drew me to her," said Birna about the actress.
“And there was something about her.
I thought she was a good actress, beautiful and warm, and I was just shot in her eyes."
When she was in New York a few years ago, the actress’s snare ran.
One of her best friends, Erling Ottar Thoroddsen, was shooting a movie there in the city and getting Birna and their friend, Gunnar Helga Guðjónsson, to help with the shootings.
“ We were working in 30 people and spending some time with strangers.
This is a naturally intimate atmosphere when you spend such a long time together a day so that it was talked about everything and nothing."
One day, there is talk that Birna is a great admirer of Mariska.
One woman in the filming team tells her friend to know the actress because he was in the filming team.
Birna could not stop thinking about the fact and regularly ask her new friend how her friend likes to work with the actress and whether Birna can get to meet her.
"She tells me to stop, she doesn't know if she can make it happen," says Birna.
When the film is finished, the group and Birna are finally trying to convince the woman to try to get around the meeting.
"She had already had a few glasses and said she would just do it."
A few days later, Birna sent a message to the woman asking if something is happening.
The woman does not respond, and Birna decides to give up.
One morning, she wakes up with a long - awaited message.
“ I watch the phone and scream at me.
Gunnar Helgi wakes up with a scream and I say, "I have to take a shower and I have to make myself nice and go down to town."
The woman had then written to Birna that her friend, actor, and recording team Law and Order were at a hotel in Times Square.
“I don’t know when they start or when they stop, but this is the name of the hotel, if you’re doing well, ” says the messages, and Birna dresses in a hurry, asking at the reception where the reception takes place and taking the elevator to the 45th floor where the group is assembled.
When a woman in the workforce comes to her house, Birna comes and asks this unsolicited woman if it can help.
"I say I'm looking for Jason and I asked the woman to tell him that Birna from Iceland had arrived."
When the friend finally arrives, he gazes at Birnah and asks how she got all the way to the end was to be a strict security guard.
Birna explains that she has just taken the elevator and asked to meet Mariska.
“ Yes, I don’t know.
"Sit here," says the friend and Birna's in charge.
Next to her, an extra player sits in the parts, and they start talking.
"I say to him, I am a fan, but you?" said Birna.
"I played it as if it were the most natural thing in the world."
Time is running out and Birna is waiting.
The players perform regularly when a break is made, they get a talk, and Birna looks around and looks for Mariska, which is nowhere to be seen.
Finally, the friend comes and tells her he's sorry.
He asked the pears to get his hands on another employee because she did not expect to go anywhere right away.
The friend’s wonder is that he accepts it and reaches out to another employee.
"He comes with his other friend and says, "This is the woman from Iceland who really wants to meet Mariska."
Then he goes.
Finally, after two hours of waiting, the new friend comes running to Birnu.
“ He says, ‘ Hurry! ’
This is an unusual situation today, there are reporters with her so she won't stop anything.
She goes straight to the car with them so you have to take the chance and go down and find her trailer.
It's white and it's marked.
Hurry up."
"So I look to the right and lose my face" Pears rise high and take the elevator down to Times Square.
There she finds about forty bicycles, some marked, and some not.
On the other hand, Mariska’s bicycle does not feel like it, and then it becomes desperate to be crushed.
“ I feel the breakdown poured on me because I had spent half a day in this, but I thought so well, I tried.
That was fun."
Vondauf keeps Birna back to the hotel, where she sees through the window, watching with pity’s eyes, realizing that Birna was unable to accomplish her mission.
Lights accept fate, and it starts to rain.
“ I go under cover to cover myself before the rain.
Then I look right and I lose my face."
No one but Mariska Hargitay stood there in her pantsuit, which she wears in the parts and Birna knew well — but Birna could hardly move out of a mood.
“ I look at the body and my hands and think now you have to move.
Now you must go toward her."
The bears do that and remember to pick up the shoulder on the actress.
“ She looks at me and I can hardly say anything.
But I'm just saying hello, "Birna's looking up.
“I say I’m from Iceland and a big fan.
She says, "It's so nice to meet you."
The conversation didn't go much further because Mariska's car is here and it's whispering.
Mariska turns to Birna and says: “I have to go, but it was really nice to meet you. ”
Birna says goodbye to the idol, watches the car drive away and then breaks apart.
“ I would call Erling and Gunna, and they thought this had not been done.
But I was crying with excitement and joy.
I say, "Yes, I'll meet her, you'll have to meet me now."
And then we toasted in soda and tequila," says Birna.
She does not regret anything, although she admits that she would probably not repeat the game.
“ It’s like this once in a lifetime, sacrificing time and energy to act like that.
But I'll always be a fan of this woman."
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to Börna Rönn Björnsdóttir in the part of Love Stories on Channel 1.
The police don't spread the virus.
There is no reason to worry that the siren virus can be supplied with alcohol speech used by the police.
This is what a police officer in the police department in the capital area said in a conversation with mbl.is.
Indications have been received from people who are concerned that the same mouthpiece is used for all drivers when the police arrive, get on a roadway, and let anyone who is on the road take a blow.
The police, however, say that cleanness is good.
“It’s not really a special mouthpiece, but we’re recommending a cup that people blow into,” says a policeman.
"Some people want to warn us about this, but we guide people to keep a little distance, up to a few centimeters."
Asking if it feels far enough, a policeman says it is.
If a positive sample is tested, the police use a different measure.
It has a mouthpiece, but it comes from a sealed plastic bag and is used only once.
Abdominal distension: May include anise to reduce pain
The relationship to depression is not accidental.
Individuals suffering from enteritis, which is a disease characterised by abdominal pain, convulsions, bloating, flatulence, constipation and diarrhoea, often experience anxiety and depression, which may lead to worsening of symptoms associated with the ADAA.
“This is because the zoster is partly controlled by the nervous system, which responds to stress, ” explains ADAA.
If your Temban is not reduced, you may be intolerant to food.
The judge tries to stop the decision that children should be let go of the immigration authorities.
In his decision on Saturday, Judge Dolly Gee invalidated the expected deadline by saying that the immigration and customs authorities in the United States do not have to let children out of custody if it is not possible to do so using any of the three ways described in her previous order.
Gee, however, also stressed the need for the immigration and customs authorities to continue their duty to release their children from custody without undue delay.
The three routes that Gee suggested are to leave families in which immigrants and customs authorities are held free together, to place children in the hands of a responsible person, or to release families to a federal court order.
Shalyn Fluharty, director of the agency Proyecto Dilley, who provides families with legal services, condemned the decision and told it to the immigrant and customs authorities to decide whether to continue to have children.
“The point is, I think that children are kept in prison indefinitely, and they don’t get out unless the immigration and customs authorities agree to let themselves be torn apart, ” said Fluharty.
The family is held in three locations of immigrant and customs authorities in Berks, Pennsylvania, South Texas (Dilley) and Carnes County, Texas.
The children in these places are between 1 and 17 years of age, according to lawyers and legal representatives.
Gee, who oversees the implementation of the Flores Convention on the Care of Children in prison, said in June that since “rules on masking and social exclusion were not or ill-implemented” it would be urgent to transfer children from these places of employment.
969 people in custody of the immigrant and customs authorities have been diagnosed with the coronin virus and are in isolation or surveillance since July 23rd, according to the immigration and customs authorities.
Of these, 25 are confirmed cases in Karnes, one in Dilley, and two in the Family Centers.
A total of more than 3700 cases have been confirmed in the course of maintenance
Will examine the regulation of the independence of the government
The prime minister does not say that life’s funds set criteria in their investment policy on the rights of workers.
Notes from the Bank’s Board of Banks that the independence of the government’s pension funds, possibly by law, needs to be considered.
After Icelandair concluded discussions with Iceland's airline company and resigned all aviation companies, the VR government declared that the government that VR appointed managers in the management of the Icelandic Stock Exchange Fund or made a vote against the participation of the Life-Early Fund in the future Icelandair equity channel.
Ragnar Thor Ingolfsson, chairman of VR, went on to say that if they did not follow the orders, rulers would be replaced.
Ragnar Thor withdrew his declaration three days later, as did VR.
Ásgeir Jonsson, bank manager of the bank, said in RUV’s news on Friday that the independence of the government’s budget would have to be guaranteed in the approved funds and possibly by legal amendment.
The Prime Minister’s daughter Katrín Jakob says it is important that the governors of the island are independent, but it already believes that it is guaranteed by law.
“Now, of course, the Financial Supervisory Board, which is involved in this matter, has said that it needs to look specifically at the rules surrounding this independence, but of course we will take it to heart if something needs to go over there,” she says.
Katrin says that the laws of life funds set moral standards in their investment policy.
It is desirable that it discusses the social and moral criteria that they want to highlight in their investments.
“ I didn’t think anything unusual was that life insurance funds also set criteria in their investment policy on the rights of working people.
But I believe that such decisions have been made through policymaking, but not through individual investment decisions," says Katrin.
'Unbearable traffic jams at the Elfsárbrüw,' said the President of the City Council of Årborg
Saint S. Haraldsson, president of the City Council of Årborg, says a traffic jam, which forms at the Elver Bridge on Selfossian daily completely intolerant.
He hopes that the fall of a new bridge over the River Olives will bring him forward.
Now that the Icelandic people are traveling through their country and traffic is on the national highways, daily traffic jams are being created at the Olfuss Bridge when drivers are on their way to Selfoss or through the community.
Long lines form along the bridge and can take on the patience of the drivers to wait in a row.
“Yes, it’s totally unbearable, it’s a traffic jam here and not just on Fridays because it’s only happened on active days too.
It is a long plentiful, sometimes quite on Hellishejöði for those who want to get by on their way east of the country and those who are coming to the west, so that it gives us an eye way that we need to get a new bridge and no later than yesterday," says Helgi S. Haraldsson, President of the City Council of Árborg.
According to Saint John, local authorities in Árborg recently met with the director of the Vega type and the designer of the Vega type, and this meeting was very positive.
“ If you’ve ever been optimistic that it’s been working on these issues, I think I can say it now because it’s really been working on this and we should be able to see that a new bridge is being invited out in the fall. ”
But is there any counsel for the drivers who wait at the bridge of the river Elvish all the days of the summer?
"Yes, it is possible to go through the straits and through the Eyarbåck, it is speeding up, but those who are going east on the bank cannot be told to go into the Light-Heaven, but those who are going into the uprising should use the Mospell-Heaven, the Dingvel and the Lygal-Heaven."
Saint S. Haraldsson, president of the City Council of Årborg, who says the traffic jam, which forms at the Elver Bridge at Selfoss intolerant.
A long group of bereaved ones make up by the bridge of Olives each day, and drivers often have to wait a considerable amount of time to cross the bridge.
Only then can you breathe deeply and think positively.
The future of a koala bear in northern Brisbane is for organizational purposes
In addition to the vitality of the area, the natural areas of Cabbage Tree Creek, and Albany Creek, the city council stated that it was an important link between the natural areas of Cabbage Tree Creek and Albany Creek.
Operators have appealed to the Court of Justice for the rejection of the City Council of Organisation and the Environment on the grounds that the construction is in line with legislation on urban planning since 2014, would meet unfulfilled organisational and social needs and “give no undue influence”.
There is great opposition to these planned projects in the neighbourhood.
In spite of the fact that the scheme is fully in line with the scheme, the manufacturers claim that it can be changed if it does not meet the requirements rather than reject them.
As it is, the work involves many stages, including a service center, a child care centre, and 39 homes.
Public submissions were over 120 at the conference, and most of them objected to the proposal, since they were too large and inappropriate for the area.
A minority leader in Brisbane City Council said that the city would have to buy the land to protect the koala.
"[Court of Mayor] Adrian Schrinner must stop wasting the funds of taxpayers fighting the culprits for judgment and buying this country to protect Brisbane's wildlife and wildlife," said the city councilman Cassidy.
"This is one of the most important sites of coal bears in the Mountain to Mangroves natural area, and there are many coal bears."
Schrinner said this week that city government wanted the koala to be protected.
"We didn't think the plot was suitable for the area," said Schrinner.
"I understand that this is now going through the judicial system, and obviously we hope that it will result in a good and positive outcome that will ensure that the home is preserved."
Schrinner said that mapping to the home of a koala bear was the common responsibility of the city government and government, but that the government was responsible for accurate maps of the home of the koala bear that local authorities support when making requests for operations for treatment.
Sunshine: Next step is to work something
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, coach Man Udd, was hoping to compete with the team securing third place in the English high school division today.
The team will therefore be playing in the European majority in the next period.
United needed equal or victory against Leicester today and was the result of the 2–0 victory of the Red Devils.
“ A great achievement for the gamers to reach third place according to the situation during the season.
I think we boys could have gotten over a spiritual hero by winning such a big game, as we've lost twice in our preliminary colors during this period.
We knew we'd have a final today, now we can start the next chapter that's for these guys to win a title," said Solskær's winner.
Manchester United still has a chance to win a title during this period, but the European Council is over in August and is almost 8th in the final.
Armistice begins at midnight in war - torn eastern Ukraine
Kiev, Ukraine — Ukraine’s army and opposition forces in eastern Ukraine are now preparing a “complete ” ceasefire that will begin at midnight and that representatives hope to be the first step towards peace after six years of conflict.
On Sunday, representatives of resistance told them that they had given their soldiers orders for weapons and issued a ban order.
The Ukrainian army said that its military forces have been "prepared" for the military.
If this were to be achieved, it would be “the way to implement other provisions” of the Minsk Peace Agreement, as declared by the President of Ukraine’s office earlier this week by the time of the ceasefire.
The aim of the Minsk Peace Agreement, which was made in 2015 through France and Germany, was to resolve the conflict between Ukraine and the apartheid members of Russia, which began in 2014 following the integration of Russia into the Crimean Peninsula and the country’s support for the apartheid regime.
More than 14,000 people have died in the fighting.
The Presidents of Russia and Ukraine welcomed both the ceasefire in a call on Sunday and stressed the importance of implementing the agreement reached at the Paris meeting in December.
Vladimir Putin, President of Russia, expressed concern at the request of Kiev that the Minks Convention should be revised and that the position of Volodimir Selensky, President of Ukraine, on the ‘indifference of the Minsk Convention, which he re-examined in this call, should be reflected in real action’.
On the other hand, Selensky stressed the need to take further action to free those Ukrainians who are prisoners of rebels in eastern Ukraine, in the Crimean Indians and in Russia, as declared by the President’s office.
According to the 2015 agreement, Ukraine can only have jurisdiction over the borders of Russia in the areas of the separation of persons when they have obtained a comprehensive right of self-government and when elections have been held in the territories.
The convention reduced conflicts, but Ukraine’s troops and rebels have continued to fight.
When leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany met in Paris in December to hold other talks, support for the Minsk Convention was announced and agreed to resume the peace process.
Selensky, who won the elections in 2019 with the promise to end the conflict, wanted Ukraine to have a command over the borders before the first regional polls, but the Kremlin government demands that the agreement be implemented without change.
The new Armed Forces Agreement was reached on Wednesday by the organisation of a three-sided team of representatives from Russia and Ukraine, as well as the European Security and Cooperation Agency, and was therefore welcomed by EU officials.
At the traditional Sunday blessing on St. Peter’s Square, Pope Francis also mentioned the arms section and said that it would have to “rebuild trust and lay the foundations for so much needed and long - awaited reconciliation with the people. ”
Police: A man shot to death at protests in Texas
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — A man was shot to death at protests in Texas as he approached a car and the driver in the car fired his weapon, according to the police.
The police spokesperson Katrina Ratliff told reporters early on Sunday that the shooting took place just before 22:00 in Austin’s protest.
The man was taken to a hospital, where he was later sentenced to death.
The car had floated, turned down the road and then accelerated the journey towards the Protestants, told the witness Michael Capochiano to the newspaper Austin American-Statesman.
According to Capochiano, the man with a rifle approached the vehicle and was shot by the driver.
The driver then drove away, said Capochiano.
Ratliff told the reporters that the first reports suggested that “the victim might have had a rifle, ” adding that the suspect was in custody and was willing to cooperate with the police.
According to newsrooms, the group had gathered for the Black Lives Matter protests on Saturday.
The countermeasures were streamed live on Facebook and heard in the whistle of the car and a few shots fired.
Marka soup in the first Blika victory in July
A moment spent winning his first victory of June 29th, IA in Pepsi Max-deil men at Copavogsvelt this evening.
Skagers are losing their third game in a row in the league.
After winning his first three games in the league, Breiða won five games without celebrating a victory and had lost three in a row before the game at IA tonight.
It was, therefore, enough to or to die for Blika, who came into the game with great power.
Alexander Helgi, the son of Victory, led the team with a fine payment in 11 minutes after the Christian son of Steindor had sent him through the defense of IA.
Six minutes later, the Christian then doubled the leadership after a very fine preparation of the Gísla Island son on the left.
Skagers did not get to land or beach in the first half of the game, where local blackmail made them enormously hard to link shipments together.
Blinks were all over the field and saw the third target in 36 minutes when Danin Thomas Mikkelsen collided in the Horny Goat of the Son of Gunnlaud.
Then his second goal was cut, and the fourth mark Blika was only three minutes later.
However, the story of the first half did not end there.
Shagitians were delighted with the latter when Trygvi Hrafn Haraldsson scored a waitress shortly before the time of play, but Kwame Quee had then broken clumsy on Victori Jonsson in Blika’s pond.
Thus, 4-1 was the position for Breiða moment when the half-tongue broke.
Only three minutes had passed by the second half when the Skagers re-cuted.
At that time, Saevar Jonsson’s hymn was alone and unelected in a marketable Blika and easily steered the ball into the net after the Kryggva Hrafn Haraldsson.
However, within three minutes of his break at Alexander Helga, there was a breach within the ÍA.
The waitress was judged, and Thomas Mikkelsen was in a position to reach Breiða moment 5–2 when only seven minutes of the second half had passed.
Five minutes after Mikkelsen’s goal, the Skagmen cut back.
Anton Ari Einarsson, Blika’s goalkeeper, caught them under pressure from Viktor Jonsson, gave the ball to Viktor’s foot from where the ball was dropped in the net.
Unbelievable 5-3 events occurred when less than 10 minutes had passed by a later half of the time, but they subsequently slowed down on the target score.
Despite the fine potential of both teams to add a line, including two Wide-Awake Goals, Kwame Quee won no more and 5–3 of the Game's Wide-Awake Outcome.
A moment of latitude thus won its first victory in almost a month, from June 29th, and is passed after the victory with 14 points in third place, two points from Val, which is a seat above and three points from the KR top team.
KR and Valur, however, have both games in Blika.
IA has to accept the third consecutive loss in the division, but the team has ten eighth, five points from the falls.
The puppy pack is not in danger despite the White House's comments
Yesterday’s producers of Huppas decided not to be able to stop showing the baby’s content in the near future.
The statement follows on from Kayleigh McEnany, the White House's media representative, that the factors that include law enforcement dogs were the victims of "cancel culture".
Canadian producers were quick to respond to McEnany’s comments and announced that their fans would have no worries about the future of the Huppas.
A number of television programs dealing with police activity have been taken out of the U.S. recently following a protest against police violence.
However, the puppies are not included, despite the fact that they have spoken on the social media.
At a press conference in the White House on Friday, McEnany said that President Trump was opposed to "exclusion culture" and, in particular, to the police.
The term refers to this when a person’s comments or actions are a source of severe reactions to the community media and is called after the party is a Protestant.
“We saw a couple of weeks ago that demonstrations in the Hvolpas Corps, children’s material about cops, were stopped.
"The same is true of Cops and Live PD," said McEnany on Friday.
Then she added that the Danish toy producer Lego had taken legal custody out of sale, but no foot is for the claim that Lego’s defenders say.
However, Cops and Live PDs have recently been taken out of the Western Pacific show.
For example, both participants are disputed for displaying images of real police positions without permission from persons appearing there.
Together for 29 years - sometimes there is jealousy and skepticism
A family therapist named Kristine Thomas daughter answers questions about family, children, and love in the Family Horn of DV.
This time she answers readers who have never been single.
We have been together since we were 15 years old, been together for 29 years, and we have two children.
We know nothing but being together, and we feel good, but we've both felt like we're missing out on something.
We have never been with other people and have no comparison of how this could be different.
This has sometimes caused jealousy and distrust in connection with whether the other person is looking around, thinking about adultery or even divorce, and changing.
When we discuss this, we agree to cultivate our relationship, but it is such a nightmare that always hangs over us.
Do you have any advice?
Thank you for the great question and I am glad that you have such open communication that you can discuss your complex feelings in connection with the relationship.
What would scare me would be if you were thinking about this in each corner, you couldn't discuss it, and even take some steps that you might so later regret.
Everything on the table, isn't it always the best?
A strong self - image has the greatest prediction of happiness in the future and the stronger your self - image, the more likely you are to have a strong self - image.
The reason that relationships that begin during adolescence do not always last all their lives is that people develop in one direction or another, but in the cases where there is a more beneficial effect, individuals can become stronger together than many others.
Since your relationship begins in your most formative years, you can conclude that you have matured and had a positive effect on each other’s self - image.
We are molded by the relationships we are in.
The way I speak is shaped by the way you listen.
The way I show myself depends on how you see me.
You know, relationships form who we are.
Could you turn your mind around and think, ‘ What do we have that others do not have? ’
What does this many - year - old stand give us?
I allow myself to say that the benefits can be far more than the flaws.
You've been molding each other for years, and you can say that you're the ones who're the ones who're the ones who're the ones who're the ones who're the ones who're the ones who're the ones who're the ones who're the ones who're the ones who're the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones.
That is more than many can say.
That's worth it?
You are referring to the fact that you have missed something, but it is important to remind yourself that major changes such as divorce and a new relationship are also accompanied by accompanying fish that you are not necessarily excited about.
You might miss starting again, learning to be alone again, getting to know a new person, and putting together families.
This follows new challenges, different problems, and potentially new and exciting challenges.
But this doesn't just come with a pink cloud and happiness, no, at your age, it can be a messy project, which can possibly never go as well as you've done to each other already.
Is that worth it?
Would it not also be wise to focus on what you can do to increase tension, unforeseeableness, and newness in your relationship?
You haven't put your shoes on the shelf yet.
There are so many things you can do to deepen your long relationship.
What attempts can you make in connection with that?
What do you need from your mate that you are not receiving?
What can you give your mate that you have never done before?
You may have to settle down and redefine your relationship.
Do you want to spend more time alone or together?
Would you like to try something new?
Today, much more tolerance toward various forms of communication and couples has begun to define their relationships in a number of ways, such as open relationships, polygamy, or a temporary breakup.
I'm not telling you at all what to do, because no expert in your solutions, but possibly it would lighten this heavy worm that's over you, if you look into this and think about solutions.
Then what do you need to be distrusted and fear disappear?
You've been together for 29 years, that must mean you're capable of things together.
Make use of it as strength, and keep your hands toward your solution.
We encourage readers to send questions and misgivings to Kristinar in an e-mail to: honobandsaela@gmail.com.
The questions will then be answered here in the Family Corner, of course, without name and with full confidence.
Lost the cup and smashed it
Despite the great experience Branislav Ivanovic has in lifting the cup and celebrating the titles, he lost and broke a wonderful prize in cheering after becoming a Russian cupmaster yesterday.
Ivanovic won a number of titles as a Chelsea player in 2008-2017 and then went home to Russia and joined Zenit.
There he has now become the Russian Champion two years in a row and yesterday the Cup Championship has won a 1–0 win at Khimki, where the victory goal came from Artem Dzyuba’s victory campaign in 84 minutes.
The money in the Russian cup is made of glass, and when Ivanovic, the leader of Zenit, lost the cup in the ground so that it broke, as you can see.
Ivanovic and his companions did not let it happen and continued to celebrate until night.
It's a war!
Coleen Rooney spoke to the lawyer Johnny Depp in the Wagatha Christie rhyme with Rebekah Vardy
Coleen Rooney has asked David Sherborne to defend himself against the accusations against Rebekah Vardy
After discussions between the football team’s mates fell apart, their acquaintances expect dramatic results.
Coleen Rooney has hired the Star Lawyer in Johnny Depp's alleged criminal case to defend himself in his so - called Wagatha Christie legal case with Rebekah Vardy.
The Mail on Sunday embodies that Rooney has assigned David Sherborne to defend herself against the accusations that she has been harmed against Vardy, with the statement that personal information has been leaked to the media of her closed Instagram access.
The news comes a few days after data were submitted to the Supreme Court, where Rebekah Vardy, who is married to the candidate Jamie Vardy in the Leicester City football team, suffered physically and spiritually from Coleen Rooney’s claim.
The paper says that the five children of the 38 - year - old mother “received severe panic attacks and panic attacks so she was afraid to leave the house ” and that Vardy, then seven months on his way,“ had been hospitalized three times... because of a panic attack caused by the move and its consequences. ”
In addition to being Depp's attorney in his criminal case against The Sun, because of claims that the actor had beaten his wife, Sherborne, 50 years old, brought the Duke and the Duchess of Sussex in their private case against the Associated Newspapers, the publishers The Mail on Sunday.
Following the failure of the peace talks between the two football owners, those familiar with dramatic behavior in the courtroom are expected to do so.
"If you found the Depp trial sightings, don't underestimate the expected war of football owners," said a source.
"Now this is a real war, and Coleen doesn't give up, neither does Becky.
Coleen Rooney claimed that someone who used Instagram access Rebekah Vardy had leaked up stories about her for a newspaper.
She was named Wagatha Christie after she realized how she spent five months limiting gradually the number of friends who could see updates on her Instagram stories until only Vardy’s account was left.
Coleen then said that he had put up an uptight story on Instagram, which had then appeared in a gossip magazine.
Vardy, who refuses to take part in the case, argues that after Rooney published the allegations, she was a bloated man, “in order to cause great harm and great suffering. ”
Coleen’s lawyers have questioned these words, saying that claims about their suffering are only presented to the media and draw attention from the facts.

Biden's billing team refuses Fox News Sunday for one week after Chris Wallace's interview with Trump
During Trump’s last week interview with Chris Wallace, President Trump doubted that the prospective President-in-Office of the Democratic Party, Joe Biden, would be in charge of the wave of questions that Wallace dropped on Trump.
We may never get an answer to that question — at least not for now.
On Sunday, Wallace informed the audience that the Bidens campaign team had told Fox News that he was “not free ” for an interview.
“In our interview with President Trump last week, he doubted that his demonist, Joe Biden, would blow himself in similar situations,” said Wallace.
“In the week, Biden’s election team asked for an interview and they said that the former vice president was not free.”
“We keep asking each week, ” he added.
For months, Trump’s election campaign team has criticized Biden for avoiding election meetings and press conferences while he attends interviews during the Crown Virus epidemic.
Although Biden has recently begun his campaign again, Trump and his associates have continued to mock the Vice - President for “falling ” at their home in Delaware.
However, begrudging Biden’s desire to attend public events has not been entertained by his presentation, as recent surveys show that Biden has a good advantage for Trump both nationally and in the main combat nations.
Real Clear Politics averages indicate that the president was down 7 percent in Florida, 6.7 percent in Pennsylvania, 8.2 in Michigan, and 6.4 in Wisconsin.
Trump worked in all four states in 2016 as he turned them over to the Republic Party when he won the fight over the White House.
In the latest Fox News Poll survey, Biden has a head start in Minnesota, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, all out of hand.
Studies also indicate that Biden has a slight advantage in Ohio, North Carolina and Arizona, three other important combatants in these elections.
And the studies indicate that states that were once strong in the Republic of the Republic, such as Texas and Georgia, are now switching between Trump and the vice president of the former Republic.
Presidential elections in which the President-in-Office invites himself in a second term in the White House are often a vote in favour of that President — and this seems to be the case now in 2020 in the fight between Trump and Bidens.
The most important issues have been the coronation virus and the economy, which is depleted by the epidemic — and the President’s performance and history in both categories of cases.
Kanye West and his wrestlers at the spine
Today, musician Kanye West apologized to his wife, Kim Kardashian, for having fallen into a state of atrocities.
The head of the mental - health professional thinks he is acquiring his creative power in the bipolar disorder, but a psychiatrist says it is important that people take drugs to keep the disease in check.
Not only is the rapper Kanye West one of the most original and influential musicians of the time, but he is no less famous as the husband of Kim Kardashian’s real - life star.
His personal life has been much ahead of open tents.
When he announced earlier in that month that he was being introduced to the president of the United States, he gave an emotional and undisclosed speech.
Later, some strange news came from him on Twitter, which included his claim that his wife was trying to have him hospitalized.
Kim Kardashian later published a statement on Instagram asking people to show their husband and family understanding; he was having bipolar disorder; and it would be difficult for his loved ones to help him if he did not want to seek help himself.
He has since apologized to her publicly.
This famous family is not alone in dealing with this problem.
It is estimated that about one percent of people experience psychosis.
Ferdinand Jonsson, head of the mental - health clinic in London, knows the disease well.
“ This disease can cause such unimaginable depression for individuals and especially their families and loved ones.
This mania, or mania, can ruin relationships and work and cause tremendous sorrow.
And then the other side, the depression, it's often very dangerous, because there's a high frequency of suicides in that group.
So I thought it was nice for her to say this.
And it's just human and human," says Ferdinand.
The head of Geðjälpar, the head of Unnsteinsson, has himself struggled with bipolarism — and is a fan of Kanye West: “He seems to have a very powerful imagination.
If we are four strands of earthy counterbass, then he is an hundred strands of heavenly harp.
And he's so superstitiously creative, superstitiously powerful, and clearly connected, because you'll be caught up with this connection thought that we've been given to trying to get into a state of manhood to know so well."
Kanye West doesn't want to take drugs, because he thinks they're depriving him of his creative gift.
He's been talking about the bipolar disorder, including on the record Ye.
Her head says it's his choice not to take drugs.
“Many people feel that this creative element of this unbridled connection and superstitious creative power of the fire he has, but then the natural defects of that often are great suffering, and the great numbers and dark cellars and darkness.”
However, Ferdinand says it is important that people with bipolar disorder are treated.
“ If you have a lot of mania or a lot of mania, you’re not making any wonderful things, you’re just on the side.
And like when people get serious depression, people are completely paralyzed by that condition," he says.
So you would advise Kanye West to take medicines?
"Consequently," says Ferdinand.
“And especially working with someone to find the right dosage and this way to balance the medicine with the greatest help, and destroy that memory of him and his abilities and his creative power.”

CBS points to 12 diplomata, a board of directors, and former agents as well as individuals who know the issue.
Gunter’s conclusion was to demand from the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs that they request permission from the ambassadors to march in arms in this country.

The Istanbul Convention is the first binding act of the world’s law that aims to prevent violence against women than the Polish Minister of Justice, Zbigniew Ziobo, describes the text as “harmful” as requiring schools to teach children about sex from a sociological point of view.
About the weekend, Ziobro said that on Monday he would begin to prepare a formal process for the country to sign the agreement.
"This ideological aspect is linked to the experiments to transform education in schools and leisure, to the study, attitudes and beliefs of young Polish generations, to the conclusion that, in our opinion, biological sex is old-fashioned and that everything really revolves around social culture."
Ziobro believes that the provisions of the Children and Young People Agreement as well as family ties in the context of LGBT people are unacceptable.
"We also reject the LGBT components in the discussion on family ties, because this is an opinion held by the left actors or groups of homosexuals who want their opinions to be binding," he said.
On Sunday, the European Council said that it was “aggravating” that Poland was suspicious of telling itself about the agreement.

Maurice Petty, engineer of the House of Honor, dead 81 years old
KANSAS CITY, Kansas (AP) - Maurice Petty, part of a quarter - mile [4 km] racing power that counted among others Lee’s father and his brother Richard, who was the first engineer to be taken into the Nascar Palace, died on Saturday.
He was 81 years old.
Petty's family didn't give up his cause of death.
His funeral has not been reported.
While other members of his family were praised for their skills behind the wheel, Maurice Petty entered the nickname “The Leader ” for his skills with the key.
He helped his family to win 198 races and seven titles in NASCAR, and also built machines to secure the Victory of Buddy Baker, Jim Paschal, and Pete Hamilton.
"The boss was one of the most successful mechanics in NASCAR history," said the chairman and managing director Jim France.
“ He came with the power that helped Petty Enterprises to achieve its excellence in the field of sports.
Although Maurice was known for his work under the hood, he also performed various roles behind the tents and did what was necessary to get his cars on the track."
Maurice Petty was born on March 27, 1939 in Level Cross, North Carolina.
He followed his father on the racetrack when he was little, and his knowledge of machine power soon became a major factor in landing Lee Petty in the 54 competitions and three championships.
He competed 26 times in the NASCAR Cup between 1960 and 64, was seven times in the top five seats and 16 times in the top ten.
However, he soon decided to focus on what would happen under the hood rather than behind the steering wheel, which proved to be a trail for his older brother, who relied on his machines for his victory.
Richard, then called the King, won the first championship with the Director in 1964 with the Plymouth driver.
They defeated again in 1967, then two consecutive years in 1970 and 1971, and reached three more titles before the end of the 1970 ’ s.
With these seven titles on their back, they share the highest number of titles with Dale Earlhardt and Jimmie Johnson.
“Maurice Petty was one of the true pioneers NASCAR and contributed to his career at Petty Enterprises in building one of the NASCAR top teams,” said Winston Kelley in a statement.
“ Although Petty’s victories are recorded as 212, he’s entitled to well over 250 victories, if taken with all the machines he built for his competitors.
The boss will be remembered forever as the best hardware in NASCAR history."
Lee Petty died in 2000, and Patricia, wife of Maurice Petty at 52, died in 2014.
He was also the uncle of the former driver and the media player Kyle Petty and Trent Owens, a team leader in the pick - up race.
“Even though we now say goodbye to Maurice Petty, one of the true and effective pioneers and heroes of NASCAR, his legacy and name will be preserved in our memories, kept on the air, and preserved forever,” said Kelley.
"We sent our deepest condolences to the Petty family."

Serbia wants to increase the number of military aircraft in the Balkans.
BELGRAD, Serbia (AP) - Serbia will strengthen its army and seek to buy more military aircraft as tension increases in the Balkans, said the president of Serbia on Sunday.
President Alexander Vucic said that “certain resurgencies ” were about buying fleets of fighters, accusing the United States and other Western states of arming neighboring Serbia, which is in NATO, as well as Kosovo, which was formerly in Serbia.
“The Americans, the Germans and the Germans take good care of their beloved offspring,” said Vucic, referring to Kosovo.
He said that the United States had recently provided Kosovo with a number of armored cars.

It is stated that no response from Washington was received at the request of Belgrade and that it is likely to be refused that an attacker of the Sukhoi-25 type will be purchased from Russia.
Serbian military neutrality has recently been provided with advanced air - protection systems from Russia, which have also provided fighter jets, attack helicopters, and armored vehicles.
China, also an allied Serbian nation, has delivered the state to serve as a military force.
U.S. officials have openly discussed criminal action against Serbia in the event of further arms being shipped to the country from Moscow, especially weapons that could endanger the security of neighbouring NATO Member States.
In the West and in neighboring Serbia, people are anxious about Russia’s armed forces and the Chinese people in Serbia.
The tension is now rising in the Balkans, where civil war was fought in the 1990 ’ s.
The Atlantic Alliance had a trade-off from Serbia to stop the bloody operations of Serbia against the apartheid of Kosovo-Albana in 1999.
Despite the formal efforts made to join the European Union, Serbia’s populist leader has further strengthened his political and military relations with the Kremlin and Beijing.
Serbia, as well as Russia and China, do not recognize the independence of Kosovo, which the United States and most Western countries have recognized.
Heart attack: This fatal condition may be reduced by eating chocolate once a week
A new study suggests that certain benefits may be beneficial to the heart muscle.
And how could this reduce the likelihood of a heart attack?
Scientists have made a meta-analysis of coronary artery disease that lasts for more than five decades.
The main symptoms of coronary heart disease (also referred to as ischaemic heart disease) are three: chest pain (angina), heart attack and heart failure.
Other symptoms may include palpitations and excessive shortness of breath.
“Success contains nutrients that are good for the heart, such as flavonoids, methylxanthines, polyphenols and steric acid, which can reduce inflammation and increase good cholesterol.”
Good cholesterol, also called high - density lipoprotein, collects “bad” cholesterol — a type of cholesterol that triples the arteries of the heart — and carries it into the liver.
The “bad” cholesterol (low concentration lipoprotein) is broken down in the liver and then removed from the body.
However, the new study does not investigate the dose or type of chocolate consumed.
It is not clear whether the participants ate dark chocolate, lactose or other cocoa jams.
The results were based on an older study that concluded that the intake of cocoa (found in chocolate) was less likely to have a heart attack.
Scientists believe that flavonoids found in chocolate reduce blood pressure and improve blood function.
Vascular activity means how well the blood distributes oxygen and nutrients around the body and carries waste materials away.
Life-style factors were not mentioned in the results of the new study.
Dr. Alice Lichtenstein said about the data that those who admitted to eating chocolate were more likely to have a healthy body weight.
She added that they could exercise regularly and feel less stress.
"Each of these factors could have an independent effect on the health of the cardiovascular system," she added.
Coles trades plastic toys out of books in a new collection campaign
“ We’ve really listened, and it was a key element in project preparation, ” said Ronson.
“We don’t believe that people want to recycle the books — we think they’ll want them, but they can recover them if they want to. ”
Ronson said the new presentation campaign had been in progress long before the COVID-19 came to light, and despite the epidemic, she believes that the timing of the new campaign was “something good ” because of the time parents are now spending with their children.
The analysts have expressed concern that consumers are becoming tired of ever - increasing toy - collecting campaigns of the largest supermarkets, but Ronson says there is no sign of fatigue yet.
"We haven't seen anything like this yet, but we keep our eyes open to this," she said.
“We report a lot of data, from week to week, months to months, to ensure that what we find is consistent with what we find in our customers.
It was Cloes who ran the process for collecting campaigns such as Little Shop in Australia, but the first one in mid-2018 was the driving force behind the best annual quarter sales of the wholesale market from the beginning.
Woolworths followed up with Lion King Osheis, who also helped the big market to increase its sales, and the last time, the environmental publicity campaign Discovery Garden offers customers free plants and flowers for planting.
However, the new campaign could have less impact this time, as UBS analysts predict an increase in sales in Australian supermarkets in the largest part of the financial year 2021.
Ronson said that customers can expect a more varied collection campaign in the future and that campaigns such as Little Shop are likely to be less frequent.
“ It’s a lot about social campaigns around the world that we’re looking at, and we keep getting inspiration from other countries, ” she said.
"We need to do so to ensure that we do more and more to our customers."
5 laps around the country this summer
The photographer and material producer Jon Ragnar Jonsson, often known as Jon From Iceland, has been more and less of a stroll around Iceland since the epidemic.
John completed a study in business studies at the University of Reykjavik a few years ago, but he is now working on traveling and producing marketing materials for individuals and businesses.
The summer began early at Joni, or in April, when he traveled all over the West and stayed in his car.
For the rest of the year, he has gone about five or six circles around the country.
In addition, he has been on countless day trips here and there.
What journey has taken place?
“ For someone like me who's always on the move and who's seen everything, it's hard to mention a favorite place.
There is more to the weather and company that matter.
Recently, after the opening of roads in June, much has gone up to the highlands.
The journeys always stand by because it is so much adventure to get to the destination.
The last trip there is a possible favorite trip of the year, but then we went 25 on 5 big cars up by Riverside and from there to Lake Álfta."
What's up with you this summer?
“I’m very excited about this, but I just finished a scuba diving course with DIVE and now take a scuba diving trip here and about Iceland.
Then I was adding a surfboard to my 'dot bag' so I'll get more to the sea than before.
So I’m heading for a ten - day solo journey with everything I need my back, but it turns out later in the summer where I go.
Otherwise, I will be high in the highlands in the near future, as it is not possible to look at that area all year round."
What's your favorite place in Iceland?
“ It’s always hard to pick a place, but the Jakull Lion has been a part of my life since I remember.
My family and I spent each summer living in a home at the roots of a British landmark, and since then I have always enjoyed that area.
I think it's safe to say that I've been there over 100 times."
With what place in Iceland do you recommend that people visit?
“ I’m going to bring one pearl from each part of the country, but it’s: Mula, Southern, Eastern, Aldeyjarfoss, Northern, Western Red, Western Snowflakes, and last but not last...
What is essential in the journey?
“I don’t go out to the country unless I have the following in my car: good flashlights, hangars, lopapeys, hunting knives, fireplaces, refrigerators, and ice cubes... those who know me know what I’m talking about. ”
Seeking 24 smokes that are afraid of drowning off an island in Malaysia
KUALA LUMPÚR, Malaysia (AP) — On Sunday the authorities in Malaysia said they were looking for 25 peace refugees who are afraid of drowning after the fall of the tourist island of Langkawi, north of Malaysia.
Zawawi Abdullah, a high - ranking government official at Malaysia’s National Sanctuary, said that the first information from the police revealed that only one of the 25 rowing men who had fallen off the boat had been permitted to swim to land.
The man who survived sought help from the police late on Saturday and has been detained while the case is being investigated, according to Zawawi.
Hundreds of thousands of Muslim rowers have fled Myanmar because of military operations, and many of them live in overcrowded refugee camps in Bangladesh.
Muslims are the majority of the people in Malaysia, which has been a frequent destination for boats that promise refugees a better life in another country.
Zawawi said that two ships and aerodynamics were used in the search.
He said that the National Sanctuary will also alert the local and local authorities in Thailand so that they can assist in the search.
He didn't give us any more information about the boat.
For the past month, the authorities in Malaysia captured 269 prisoners of tranquillity in custody and found bodies on board a boat suspected of being used in smuggling off the coasts of Langkawi, but they decided he was unwilling to go back to sea.
Later, Malawi’s National Guard said that the 269 individuals had been taken out of a larger ship by dozens of people who are thought to have died and that their bodies had been thrown into the sea.
The prime minister, Muhyiddin Yassin, said that Malasia could not accommodate any more fugitives, since it is struggling with economic prosperity because of its coroner virus epidemic.
He said, however, that those already in the land would not be sent back to sea.
In Malaysia, more than 2 million illegal immigrants live as well as some 180,000 refugees and asylum seekers — including 101,000 of them — who are registered with the United Nations Organization of Refugees.
People in Aswan collect, watch, and return a chocolate shipment to Sudan after a car park
On Sunday, at the crossroads at the village of Wadi Karkar, when the driver fell into a coma because of a heat blow, the transport vehicle set off to Sudan with tons of chocolate on the international road between Aswan and Abu Simple.
The inhabitants flocked to help the driver where he was lying and to save the product that had been stolen.
One of them, Alaa Bahr, described his position so that the driver was “passing past our village; we could not just stand by.
We're supposed to help people in distress, no matter where it comes from."
He added that the villagers had arrived on an ambulance to pick up the driver and then tried to save the truck’s cargo, estimated at three million Egyptian pounds.
Bahr told the villagers that they had been at the scene from morning till evening and saved as much of the cargo as they could.
“ What we felt was most important was saving the driver’s life, protecting the cargo, and reopening the international road, ” he said.
The villagers were willing to blow up the driver’s water and shelter, said Bahr, adding that they just wanted to make sure he got to and from the village safe.
There were already broken victims at the Congress, and the coronary virus could make them worse.
“The epidemic alone calls on our elected representatives for the leadership and vision we expect in times of difficulty,” says a report prepared by Leonard Steinhorn, professor of communication at American University, and Mark Sobol, author and expert in organizational development and management.
"But we are also faced with other debts that concern the genetic sin of our people and the racial disorder that has plagued our country from its founding."
The study examines familiar subjects related to the pitiful state of the House: lack of real links between groups, schedule limiting opportunities for communication, over-compression of power in leadership positions, constant demands for funding, reports of cooperation between groups, negative impact of the daily working media, the fact that the most important elections to Congressmen are often pre-elections and finally the silence of minority groups.
There is also a warning that the Congress will move more into the world because of the pandemic, where such a system, which allows elections with the help of local representatives without the need for Congressmen to travel to Washington, could add to the problems that exist.
If the idea of a teleconsultation reaches its footing, it would be a serious setback for attempts to increase communication between groups, as the report states.
“The epidemic of the world was forced to transfer most of its activities to the Internet, and we certainly understand why, ” says the report.
"But despite the need, such virtue should not be interpreted as necessary."
The paper says that the Congress “needs more but not less communication between the members of the Congress, face to face. ”
They need to study each other's areas better, have polite conversations to find common ground, and build a relationship based on trust that can lead to increased understanding and solutions."
The call for courtesy was particularly valid this week, when Ted Yoho, a member of the Republican Congress of Florida, attacked Alexandriu Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Senator of the Democratic Party, with his adage and his associates in the Republican Party, to attack Liz Cheney, a member of the Republican Congress in Wyoming with hostile words.
Congresswoman Val Demings talks about the vice president's office, tells Trump to hear it for mercy.
The Congresswoman Val Demings (Democrats, Florida) was not ashamed to discuss his interest in serving as Vice-President of the potential government of Joe Biden and to express sincere gratitude for being included in his office.
This respected member of the BlackPress International Black Party group was interviewed by BlackPressUSA on live broadcast for #FIYAH! and told of its history, energy and commitment that has brought her to the current location, and began with the words "You all know my story. I grew up as a daughter of a maid and a housekeeper in Jacksonville, Florida."
Daming was one of the four prosecutors of the Senate in the referees ’ hearings of Donald Trump in the January elders ’ department.
Regardless of whether the elders condemn Trump, it will be recorded in history that he is the fourth president to be accused.
In an interview with the NPR of his office at Capitol Hill, the former director of the council of attorneys was quoted as saying, “Was this worth it?
She added that although the decision had been disappointing, democracy had been obliged to follow the case regardless of its outcome.
During the interview, Demings made it clear that she was opposed to Trump’s arrest of Roger Stone, who was convicted of lying before the Congress (more than any other crime) as well as his deliverance from other criminals convicted of similar crimes, when she said: “The infidelity of your friends, those who have lied and cheated to cover up your indebtedness. ”
Deamings is at the top of Joe Biden's list of potential vice presidents, who also hold Karen Bass President CBC (Democrats, California), Stacey Abram's ex-Minister of Georgia, Kamalu Harris (Democrats, California) and Tammy Duckworth (Democrats, Illinois), Keisha Lance Bottoms mayor Atlanta, Susan Rice former U.S. ambassadors and a few others.
However, she noted that only one person would decide who would volunteer with Joe Biden in the fall.
"It's Joe Biden."
Then she took her hand to her mouth while she laughed and pretended to whisper to those watching the live broadcast, adding, “If you want to call... you can do it for me. ”
There is no doubt that regardless of political views, history books view this period as a time when American politics and attitudes developed.
This did not go unnoticed by Deming.
She pointed out that the number of women who come forward to vice president of the United States is an opportunity to break through what is left of the “glare roof ” — especially for women of African origin.
“ It’s exactly this opportunity that I work so hard at all my life to create for young boys and girls who have heard that their color is wrong, that they don’t have enough money or that they’re of the wrong sex, ” she said.
The Congressman resolved to ensure that the Democratic Party Committee and the Biden voting body would advertise and work with the Black Press of America to get as many people to vote as possible.
“I will call Tom Perez (the chairman of the Democratic Party’s National Committee) and I will put this at the top of my list,” said Demings.
She agreed that this would have to happen now rather than later in the campaign.
When she replied to the former foreign minister Hillary Clinton that Trump could refuse to leave the White House, he lost the election, and another editorial saying that the president is preparing to reach himself, lived over Deming: “To the extent that comes up to reach himself made me sick. ”
“ But who would ever do that to anyone other than Trump?
I think he hates this job.
It should not be possible to break the law and ignore the constitution in this work.
I think he hates the job, but he hates losing.
I can quite believe that the President will not want to leave the White House, but we have our ways to take care of it, and if that happens, I just want to be with those who let it happen."
Children’s leg bottles
There are bottles for children who want to drink to their parents from a young age in bottles that fit the table in better days.
No doubt now there are some parents who celebrate — or the parents who have been led by childish carnivals.
Even so, the children are reaching out to their parents, as they are more excited to see their feet.
These discussed bottles are found on the modernhousesessentials.com page, which contains various pieces of gold.
The bottles have a good tip, a stable foot and a good temperature--as kids can use the sop whether it's hot or cold.
Each bottle has a capacity of about 150 ml.
Those who want to examine the bottles can peer into the HOME page, but the bottles are on offer these days in a small $2,400 (U.S.).
Alibaba and Jack Ma went to court in Gurugram for an ex-employee
Gurugram, July 26: The company Alibaba and its founder, Jack Ma, have been brought to trial in Gurugram after the company’s former employee claimed that he had been expelled for protesting literature and false news in the company’s programs.
The case is addressed in Gurugram’s District Court, and Sonia Sheokand, the court judge, has issued a policy for Alibaba, Jack Ma, and over 10 others, asking them to attend court on July 29, according to news.
The judge has also requested written answers from the company, according to Reuters.
Parmar, who worked at the UC Web office in Gurugram until October 2017, is performing 268,000 U.S. dollars in damages, according to court documents.
“We are committed to the domestic market and to the well-being of its employees and are in line with current legislation.
We can't express ourselves on current proceedings," said UC India in a declaration.
'The application also contains a 'list of sensitive words', which contains a password in Hindu and English, such as 'India' and 'China-China border' and 'China-India war', which is stated in the UC Web's complaint to write material on their systems in India,' according to Reuters.
For the past month, the Ministry of the Interior banned 59 Chinese cell phone programs, including UC News and UC Browser, in line with increased tensions between the two countries.
Agent New York City Fire Department says it is "completely" okay to exclude a white firefighter from the honorary
A representative on the subject of diversity in the New York City fire brigade says it is "completely" right to keep a white firefighter from honorary duty so that a flagbearer can all be black, according to a new report.
White firefighter Daniel McWilliams has raised a case for racial discrimination after he was removed from the ranks of flagbers at the Memorial in November 2017 to commemorate the fallen members of the Vulcan Society, which is the brotherhood of black firefighters.
The chief fire extinguisher in the field of diversity and accessibility, lawyer Cecilia Loving, was also responsible for the decision to interrogate the New York State Human Rights Division under the New York Post.
McWilliams is one of the three firefighters in the department who, in a historical form, are seen lifting the American flag at Ground Zero on the days following the September 11 attack.
According to McWilliam's attorney, the fire department had chosen him to be alone in honor of the flag bearers at the memorial ceremony.
Being a flagbearer at this ceremony was a "great honor and privilege" for McWilliams, as stated in the CNN case law.
When he arrived at the ceremony, however, he was prevented from participating in the honorary campaign of the then president of the Vulcan Society, Regina Wilson, for it was claimed that she had asked that all flag bears at the Mass would be black.
She then asked McWilliams, a 29-year-old New York City firefighter, to help in another way."
Among the claims that she had asked him to do so is to escort the civilians and set up casual firefighters away from the fair.
McWilliams claimed in his lawsuit that he asked Wilson if she was taking him out of the glory because he wasn't black.
She confirmed that it was, he said.
Wilson, who has served at the New York City Fire Department for 21 years and who also participated in the rescue work on September 11th, will have replaced McWilliams with one of the members of the Vulcan Society.
McWilliams claims that he left the memorial “to spare himself from further shame, humiliation and shame, ” when friends and associates heard what went on between them, according to the New York Daily News.
When Loving, who is black, witnessed before court, lawyer McWilliams, Keith Sullivan, asked her: “So praying that everyone is black in honor is not a difference? ”
"No, it isn't," said Loving, according to the New York Post.
Sullivan also asked Loving if it was all right to ask that everyone be black in honor, which she replied, “Absolutely. ”
Promise explained that it would be all right for a white person to replace a black person to “give up our specialties and different backgrounds to create pride, consensus, and support for one another. ”
McWilliams first filed for discrimination based on race at the New York City Fire Department in January 2018.
He then sued Wilson, New York City Fire Department, New York City, and non-computed individuals in May 2019.
Sullivan said that after McWilliams filed a complaint, Wilson’s supporters had avenged him and threatened him.
At one point, one of her supporters would have laid hands on McWilliams and said, “I’ve heard of you, they told me you would behave like this, and now you know who I am.”
In the field, Sullivan wrote that it would have been "poor" to exclude McWilliams from the honorary service at the fair and evidence that one thing did not apply to everyone in the fire department.
“If you are a black person and you are different from a white person at work, you will be reminded at most,” said Sullivan.
Wilson received a one - hour counsel for her treatment of McWilliam, according to the law.
While receiving a white person who disagrees with a black person, Sullivan wrote: “Crimeful punishment. ”
"The New York City Fire Department has created a policy and process designed to please members of the Vulcan community, who act in a racist manner, excuse their actions and assist them ... and this needs to be stopped," wrote Sullivan.
Fearing a walking passerby and demanding money
One person was arrested in the city after an attempted robbery, threatening a walking roadman and trying to obtain money from the person.
The man was saved in a prison cell.
Then the police were notified of a man with a knife in the city center.
The knife was confiscated, and the report was taken from the subject.
About eighty cases were filed on the desk of the police in the capital area from 17 a.m. to 05 p.m. and this morning six were stored in a prison cell.
Among other things, police stopped the driver who pulled a trailer on Kjalarnes, where the trailer was in a very bad condition.
The trailer was stationary and intended to be provided by the owner of a transport vehicle to transport it to town.
Then the police stopped drug production in the Year.
Two were arrested for the matter and were released after a report had been completed.
There were also reports of people who shot up fireworks in the Yeartown.
They had been out of the scene when police came to the scene “end probably known their shame, which is still quite a long way from the turn of the year. ”
Thousands of Khabarovsk people are still demanding absolution from Putin
Thousands of the city’s inhabitants were led yesterday by the Russian city of Khabarovsk, protesting the arrest of the district governor in the same region south of East Russia and the insertion of his successors, who have never lived in the region.
The former governor, Sergei Furgal, enjoys great popularity, and tens of thousands of citizens protested when he was arrested and detained in Moscow earlier this month, accused of ordering murder of three businessmen 15 years ago.
In a recent week, Furgal was formally appointed as district governor and his 39 - year - old brother, Mikhail Degtyarev, appointed to replace him, with little regard for the locals.
Degtaryev is said to be inexperienced and, worse still, without any connection with Khabarovsk and called the citizens after his resignation the quickest.
They've been calling Degtaryev to blow the ears.
The protesters yesterday were less than the first of the protests, or fifteen to twenty thousand, and the demands were the same as before: the liberation of Furgal and the resignation of Vladimir Putin, president of Russia.
"We want the governor to be released, because we think his arrest is very likely to be illegal," says Alina Slepovu, a half-timbered protester.
She claims that the Kremlin’s agents had Furgal arrested “to defend their own interests, not the interests of the region. ”
The Khabarovsk police left Protestants unsolicited despite the clear violation of the current ban on the Korean virus epidemic.
In Moscow, however, the police arrested at least ten people who met on Pushkin Square to show protesters in Khabarovsk support in action, reports the British Guardian newspaper.
Furgal's group, the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, is a group of hard-line internationalists, and is considered by political commentators to be somewhat loyal to the Kremlin government in most cases.
The same political commentators, on the other hand, inform the BBC that Furgal’s victory in the district election two years ago — which was great and clear — was a major shock to Putin and the United Kingdom, and although it suggests that the arrest of the Kremlin in the East was weakening.
Furgal was arrested on July 9, and moved to Moscow, where he is awaiting trial.
He is accused of ordering three murders in 2004 and 2005.
Two of them went out, and the third went out.
Sarah Rainsford, writer of the BBC in Moscow, says Furgal’s followers, who enjoy a popular home, convinced that the charges and arrests have political roots.
They want to know why governments have waited for him to be arrested until now, says Rainsford, 15 years after his alleged crime.
Tree branches gave up when the hurricane Hanna rode over South Texas
The hurricane Hannah fell to the power of a tropical storm after he landed on the coasts of southern Texas on Saturday, July 25, but the government warned that the storm could still cause dangerous rapids.
The U.S. Weather Office said that the greatest threat to the south of Texas and the northeastern part of Mexico was as the storm moved west-southwest on Sunday.
Jorge Castillo shared this video on Twitter and told Storyful that he had taken it outside his home in Combes, Texas, on Sunday morning.
Homeless women with disabilities participate in the fight against COVID-19 in Chennai
Shanthi, a disabled woman who is educated as a dresser, visits 250 homes each day to identify people with symptoms in Kodambakkam, a large Covid spot in Chennai, where about 10,000 cases have been reported.
Work starts early at her, 7:30, and ends around 16:00.
It measures the warmth of the people, asks for symptoms, and teaches them about the importance of using masks, washing hands regularly, and keeping others away.
In fact, her work has resulted in the detection and treatment of infection over time in four positive individuals.
Shanthi is one of 16,000 people in Chennai City who take care of the home screens but are not healthcare professionals.
According to the government, the project has contributed to a 50 - percent reduction in positive cases, in the daily Chennai count, while they are increasing in other provinces of Tamil Nadu.
Shanthi says that not all the residents cooperate.
She adds: “Flying is cooperative when a woman with a disability approaches them.
Some, though, become irritable.
This is not to worry about.
I feel that people should be able to be safe.
When I come back the next day, the people are polite.
It helps to build a good relationship."
And there are more women like Shanthi who stay in the gisttyle of the city for women with disabilities and fight against Covid-19.
Not far from Kodambakkam, Kavitha, who also has disabilities, has also taken part in the campaign as an overseer.
Even though Kavitha has a specially designed bicycle, she walks to meet people and hangs on her hillside.
“ I’m happy, ” she says about a reduction in infectious diseases, but she adds: “I want to see them go down to perhaps about 100 a day.
I'm sure we can make it."
On the first floor of the Gistina, where the two live, are Matilda Funceca, a basketball player using a wheelchair, and Manimekalai, a teacher, and they send all the data coming from about 40 women to a Chennai-city web server.
Matilda is not afraid to be infected by the corona virus.
“ When we help others, ” she adds, “God protects us. ”
When asked what steps she will take, Manimekalai says: “I use a mask, keep away, and wash my hands often.
I also drink Kabasura Kudineer, a sit-ha drink that enhances the immune system."
A few months ago, when the crown virus first arrived in Chennai, these disabled women guarded their time and skills in sewing a mask for health - care professionals in the city.
Dr. Aishwarya Rao and the director of the Gistyli, as well as the Dorcas research center that runs the shield, says: “They adapt to the needs of each hour.
Previously, masks were missing, and they did not leave behind.
Now there is an intervention in society, and they answered the call."
Coronary virus transmission in Tamil Nadu is now 200,000 after a new 6989 case in the past 24 hours, but it is also the highest number of infections detected in one day, according to official data.
Eighty-nine have died, and 7758 have recovered over the past day.
The total number of infections in the state is now 206,737.
Police are trying to find out about the last journeys of a teenager in Helensburgh
Investigators investigating the death of a teenager in Helensburgh are now trying to put together a timeline for his last journey.
The 19-year-old Kirk Allan found himself living in Johnson Court's home at 6:25 a.m. Saturday.
A 30 - year - old man was arrested, and the police confirmed on Sunday that he had now been charged with death.
He'll be in court at Dumbarton on Monday.
Police chief Steve Martin said: “Our mind is with Kirk’s family and friends in these difficult times.
Policemen will continue to work with society and support it.
Our research continues to get a full picture of what happened, especially the last days of Kirk's death, but we're not looking for anyone else in connection with death."
South Africa: Ashwell Prince and Marsha Cox share their experiences of discrimination
In the past few weeks, it has been known that many skeletons are still in the closet in connection with racial discrimination in sports in South Africa.
A constructive dialogue needs to take place, and action is needed to ensure that everyone is welcome in sports.
Ashwell Prince, former protea’s cricket star, told his former white comrades and accused them of racial prejudice by saying that he and other black teammates were “vote players. ”
Prince said that the black players of Protheas were publicly known as the “female players ” of their white companions.
He added that even though black players, such as Makhaya Ntini and now Kagiso Rabada, still got the highest standards in the sport, some people still linked them to the quota discussion.
Prince, now coach of the Cape Cobras team, made this statement fall at the United Coalition for Sport and Community Based Organisations (UCSCBO) on Thursday night.
The aim of the association is to continue to discuss historical racial discrimination in South African sports.
“ As I said when I got down on social media, it’s not my intention to come down and bring people’s names down to the area, but these are real events...
"You're doing everything right, but you're still infecting"
Paul Roberts, a former musician and a builder who became a programmer at NASA, is now working at a software company.
He and his wife, an ex-s nurse at the Methodist Hospital who looks like a bright-sighted person, held out an amateur magazine on the Internet and attended Comic Con events earlier in the years.
Once a week, they're in their two daughters, a son-in-law, and a 7-year-old, playing a huge Uno game.
“ They are amazing nerds, ” says Roman, 38 years old, about his parents.
Sheryl Roberts, 65 years of age, is aware of the dangers of the pandemic — she has diabetes, asthma, and heart disease that can put her at increased risk.
Her husband has a chronic lung disease and a stanchion that previously keeps a blocked coronary vein open.
"We've been so careful, very careful, and we've kept away from people," said Sheryl Roberts.
Her husband started working from home in the spring, when the epidemic fought hard on Washington, New York, and other areas around the country.
Paul has occasionally gone to the big market at an old age, and their only real date in the past month was Sheryl when they started looking at wildflowers through the car window.
Their younger daughter was also cautious.
But then she came sneezing home from work one day at mid - June and thought she was allergic.
Soon she had cough, fever, headache and diarrhoea, and lost all sense of taste and smell, which are typical symptoms of the coronae virus.
“ She said, ‘I don’t know what’s going on, Mom, but I was wearing a mask, wearing gloves, washing my hands, ’ ” said Sheryl.
"You're doing everything right, but you're still infecting."
Elaine Roberts, who was diagnosed with positive coronaevirus, did not become seriously ill.
However, the situation became much worse for her parents.
Paul Roberts and his wife began sneezing and then coughing, just like their daughter, and then got a fever and a lot of pain in the body.
Then he became “very sick, very fast, ” said Sheryl Roberts.
On June 22, he became confused.
She worried about his oxygen level.
It was low, and she asked their older daughter to take him to an emergency reception, for the second time in two days.
The royal couple formerly felt that they were "skinned" in the Queen's Christmas House, according to a new book
MEGHAN Markle and Harry Bretaprins felt that his grandmother, Queen of the United Kingdom, had “shanned ” them in their holiday home.
The couple’s new life story, “Finding Freedom, ” shows that they felt overlooked by those in the collection who could see power in the Christmas Eve.
Pictures on the desk with which the queen sat showed, among others, the William of Bretaprin, Kate Middleton, and their three children, Karl Bretaprins, and his wife Kamilla, as well as Prince Philip.
But Meghan and Harry were nowhere to see despite Archie’s birth in May, yet the boy was referred to as her Majesty’s “eighteen grandchildren. ”
The new book, published in August, also notes that Meghan and Kate Middleton “were never friends, ” since they“ struggled to overcome superficial courtesy ” and met only several times.
Yesterday, it was claimed that Harry and his brother Vilhjölm had begun some years before his relationship with Meghan was established, but it reached its peak because of the marriage of Vilhjölm and Kate Middleton.
The Duke of Sussex felt that he was a “warrant ” at events with his brother and Kate Middleton, claiming that“ he wanted to change things long before Meghan came into existence. ”
The Congressmen accuse labor leaders of wanting to keep public employees “world forever. ”
Congressmen of the League accuse labor leaders of wanting public workers to be “world forever ” after the leaders protested Boris Johnson calling for people to return to work
Government officials were accused of wanting workers “to stay home forever ” after protesting Boris Johnson’s appeal to people to return to work.
The Congressmen were angry when the unions of public and public employees told their associates to frustrate when their superiors ordered them to return to their places of employment.
Andrew Percy, former minister, said “unacceptable ” that the need for public service such as the release of passports would be halted while employees in the general market would have worked hard to keep society walking in the corroboreal epidemic.
“It is unacceptable that people refuse to return to their jobs while workers in stores and factories around the country have continued to work so that public employees can eat during this time,” he said.
“ Many of these workers now want to go on vacation but cannot do so because of the people who refuse to go back to their places of employment, even if they are safe.
Business leaders cannot maintain this policy of staying home forever – especially now that we know that people can return to work in a safe way."
Following a call from the Prime Minister last week, Alex Chisholm, a newly appointed head of public service, announced that a government “has to turn away from working at home in public service and hasten their return to work until August 1st. ”
The public and public employees’ association told their associates, who number about 200,000, that they would not have to meet this requirement, saying this was politics.
A spokesman for the public and public trade union, the largest trade union of public employees in the United Kingdom, said that the demand for a return to work places was “not put ahead with the health and safety of our social partners, nor to strengthen our economy.
This is one - handed because of political pressure from Congressmen who insist that public service should be used as an example to get others back to work.
Our advice to our associates is clear: if you are doing your job at home and someone in your department is asking you to return to work, don't take what you need to do, of course."
The dispute is rooted in growing dissatisfaction with delayed versions of passports because employees work at home, but some 400,000 people are now said to wait for their applications to be processed.
The Ministry of the Interior has now published that it will be “templating” British applications for travel over the next two weeks, and from those who have been waiting for a passport for more than four weeks.
Public and public employees have admitted that some have had to wait up to 143 days for passports but argue that “small and often narrow offices ” make it difficult for 4,000 staff members of the passport service to keep the necessary distance.
The former minister of the government, David Davis, urged the leaders of trade unionists to “keep their senses ” and seek cooperation with governments to get people back into their places of employment.
He added that if he were in government, he would ask a labor leader: “What is it you want? That people stay home all summer? ”
However, several of Britain’s largest companies have also ignored Johnson’s reference to people to return to work.
A study of larger workplaces with a total of about 400,000 workers revealed that only about 40,000 of them have returned to their places of work.
The emphasis on history can play an important part in reconciliation
The gap has widened, but understanding and reconciliation should be the goal.
The school system is partly to blame for this lack of knowledge and understanding.
There is too little to learn from the history of Australia.
The fact is that without radical action, the only article that specifically deals with our history — “Saga Australia ” for 12th grade — will die out within the next five years or even earlier.
Last year, only 628 students in the Victorian Republic completed a study in Australia of a total of 49,324 who completed primary schooling, or just 1%.
Over the past six years, this number has almost half been reduced, but nearly 100 fewer students enroll in the course each year.
The main reason why so few students choose to learn about Australia’s 12th - grade history is that in previous years, little has been done to arouse their interest.
History is not even a unique field of study, but it falls under the broader “sense of thought. ”
Therefore, in the 7th and 8th centuries, only one short unit on the "early and island settlements on the Torres Strait and their culture" was completed.
In the 9th and 10th years, there is another unity about Australia during World Wars.
For many students in Victoria, this is all that is referred to as Australia’s history during elementary school years.
During the 9th and 10th years, there is another optional unit for the period 1750-1918.
It is important to take three steps to save Australian history in Victorian schools.
First, history must become an independent subject, such as English, mathematics, and science.
Since history is only a part of intellectuals, it has little room in the study directory.
It is usually taught by people who have a general education in mental science but who have not learned history.
Historical skills such as the diagnosis of information are complex.
We need to employ more specialized historians to ensure that such skills are taught in an accessible and exciting way.
Third, from 1788 to 1914, the history of Australia will become a duty.
Students appreciate what they know.
So many of my former students chose not to learn Australia’s history in the 12th year of study, since they would have had to learn the material from scratch.
Knowledge of history alone does not bridge deep gulfs between races.
But without it, as can be clearly seen in the Victorian study book, the assignment is hopeless.
Dr. Matthew Bach is a member of the Congress of Victorian State and former assistant director Ivanhoe Girls' Grammar.
Aron Elís in the European Capital Finals - Ice cream divided by half
Aron Elís Thrandarson is in the finals of the Danish top football team for Europe.
Isaac Bergmann Johannesson played only the previous half with the top team Norrköping against Falkenberg in Sweden.
Aaron Elis was a member of OB in Denmark when the team moved on to the final stage in the European Championship.
OB will meet AGF or FC Köbenhavn in the final game, but it depends on whether the teams end up after the final round of the top part of the Danish Championships later today.
Aron Elis played the whole game in 1-1 games with Horsens today, but OB had won the first games at home, 3-1, and won a total of 4-2.
Isaac was in the initial team of Norrköping, an unexpected 2–0 below after the previous half-game against Falkenberg in the original Swedish league.
At the beginning of the second half of the game, Norrköping was one of those who had to resign.
Norrköping was evaluated, but Falkenberg arrived at 3–2 in 89 minutes.
Still, the time for Norrköping to get out of hell at the last minute was three to three.
Norrköping is still at the top, with 24 points, four points ahead of Elfsborg and five points ahead of Malmö, which is playing for good later today.
Falkenberg was able to escape from the bottom for a while, but there is a ladder above Helsing City and Kalmar, who play well.
Collecting Records of Coronary Time Celebrations
Anna Lilja The daughter of Victory set up the group “Meeting of the Nation 2020 ” to gather sources of the national festival that the islanders intend to hold for the next weekend.
Many will camp in their gardens and rejoice with friends and relatives.
Anna Lilja talked to Wampa on the weekend of the Wave.
“ Nothing has yet come in, which is also very exciting because there are 600 people in the group so that they are clearly going to do something, ” says Anna Lilja.
There's something about the islanders having tent parties at home in the garden.
“ People have talked about being with their own [festivities], perhaps camping in the garden, and squabbling up the family like they always do at that time, ” says Anna.
“ You expect people to spend time with their people.
However, it is likely that many people will not be there “but still hold some small National Festival somewhere else. ”
The National Festival Committee is now working hard to repay the tickets that were bought, but Anna believes that many locals are more likely to make money for the next year’s festival.
"People are even investing in tickets now and making 2021. "
“I’m a great National Celebrating Man, I love the preparation and everything about it, but sometimes something comes into your life that you can’t control, and that’s just the way it is,” says Anna, “but it has been said that people are asking if the islanders can’t let go of the National Festival once. ”
Anna Lilja claims not to have set up the group for himself or to encourage people to celebrate their own National Festival but to gather the records of World Trade Celebrations in the Islands this year.
“ What did people do in these strange times?
I'm not going to use this in something or anything, but then I'm going to find someone who uses such authority in something, but I was just creating some area where people can put in what they're doing."
Then, too, a fire has been recharged each year on the Rocket.
“ I think many people are excited about getting burned on Friday night.
The only thing that makes a line in the account, of course, is that the prediction is nothing special."
"This burn will be on fire, but it just has to tell you how it will be," says Anna Lilja.
The interview with Anna Lilju can be listened to as a whole in the player below.
Is Prince Andrew to be mentioned in new sexual - crime papers?
The British royal family is now preparing to respond to possible new information in court papers on his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell
A U.S. judge has ordered that secret documents relating to Epstein and Maxwell be made public
Included in these 80 pages of documents are parts with Maxwell’s 2016 testimony
The display of these pages could also put great pressure on Prince André, where they can find communication between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015
Virginia Roberts, the alleged sex slave of the disgraced American financier, asserted in 2015 that she had been forced to have an agreement with Prince Andrew.
Prince Andrés is now preparing to defend the possible publication of information in the week with even more damaging accusations of his friendship with the child - addict Jeffrey Epstein and his supposed accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell.
During the week before, U.S. District Justice Loretta Preska ordered the publication of 80 secret legal documents related to Maxwell and Epstein, counting hundreds of pages.
The display of these vast documents would be a shock to the 58 - year - old Maxwell, who have much of its testimony before lawyers in 2016, including what its lawyers have said is “exciting questions ” about her sex story.
They could also put great pressure on Prince Andrew, who has one document that contains a communication between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015, when Virginia Roberts, the alleged sexual slave of the disgraced American financier, asserted in 2015 that she had been forced three times to have an agreement with André.
Andrew has repeatedly and unequivocally rejected these statements.
Posts from 2015 leaked and BBC published in the last year seem to indicate that Andrés asked Maxwell for assistance in responding to Robert’s claims.
We have no doubt that the duke will receive rebellion
There he said to his wife: “Let me know when we can talk, and I have some questions I need to ask you about Virginia Roberts. ”
Maxwell replied: “I have information, so call me when you have an hour off. ”
Last night, a source standing close to Andrew said: “The Duke of Jorvík has done nothing wrong, so we are not concerned about opening a court case.
As courts in the United States have tried to point out, this does not mean that an accusation is true even if it appears in court documents.
The U.S. courts have encouraged the media and the public to take full care in handling the allegations presented in court documents.
We totally agree with that.
We have no doubt that the duke will have a full rebellion in the next few weeks."
Maxwell is now in custody at the Manhattan detention center, waiting for trialogues to find and lure some of Epstein’s victims who were under legal age from 1994 to 1997.
It is also accused of being malicious about refusing to know about his abuse.
She rejects all the accusations.
Maxwell last discussed with lawyers in April and July 2016 in connection with Robert’s criminal code, which now includes the last name Giuffre, which she picked up after her marriage.
Some 40 pages of a total of 418 of this testimony were made public last year, but after the decision of Judge Presna in New York last week, more parts could be opened first on Thursday.
Lawyers Maxwell received one week to file an appeal.
Epstein was found dead in his penitentiary in New York last year when he was in court for sexual crimes.
Detectives are looking for a violent attack on the streets of Edinborg
Three attacked a man in Edinburgh and caused him injuries that could prove permanent.
The 29 - year - old victim was attacked in Drum Street, Gilmerton, between 23:00 and 23:30 on Saturday.
The Scottish police reported that he had been transferred to the Royal Hospital with serious injuries.
Investigator Dale Miles, who conducts the study, said: “This was a violent and unwarranted attack. ”
The suspects fled to Newtoft Street.
One was thought to be in its 30 ’ s, about 180 cm [180 cm] high and strongly grown.
He was cut short and had dark hairs in white shirts, dark trousers, and dark shoes.
A detective named Miles said: “I pray to all those in this area when the attack was made and saw something suspicious of presenting themselves. ”
The ambassador wants to carry a gun in Iceland.
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, Ambassador of the United States of Iceland, wants to carry a gun here on land and wants to increase security.
He was said to have been “weaned ” about his safety since he came to the country last year.
This is stated in the CBS report, which also says that this will is Gunter, although he is working in “the safest state in the world. ”
Gunter is said to have asked the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs to make a dedication to the Icelandic government to carry a gun.
Then he's asked for an armored car and a vest that will protect him from knives.
CBS sources say the council has withdrawn, though Gunter announced that he is not at risk in Iceland.
According to CBS, Iceland's Department of Foreign Affairs did not provide information on whether a request from the United States for a possible armament of Gunter was received because the authorities did not express their views on the security measures of a foreign country.
Even though no requests were made, the newsroom’s sources say that no requests were made.
Then CBS also has it after his sources said that Gunter should not be seeking to carry weapons, for this would be taken as an insult here on land.
Gunter has been an experienced dermatologist in California for years.
He's active in the Republican Party of the United States, and he's a bold supporter of President Donald Trump.
He recently called attention to this country when he was looking for “the invisible China virus. ”
CBS sources also say that Gunter was severely affected by the U.S. Embassy in Reykjavik.
Already, he had seven second - named officials on the May May embassy.
Among other things, he has accused them of belonging to the “deep state, ” which is supposed to be a net of U.S. officials working against Trump, and was angry at the fact that one carried snow into his office.
The secretary went to Washington DC in February for a conference and refused to return to Iceland for a few months, according to CBS sources.
Gunter is said to have wanted to work from California, but eventually Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, had to order him back and did it in May.
The home game form is a key to Jose Mourinho, who says Tottenham has an easier game to play when fans get to play again
With the help of Jose Mourinho, Tottenham Hotspur hasn’t lost a game in a home field since the original department went back into operation, but he says that it would be much easier to keep a good team at home if the audience were allowed to play.
Question has won 12 victories at home during this season, but it has lost four times — only one of the six teams that are above them has lost more at home.
The coach of Portuguese said that while such triumphs were possible without the supporters, it would be easier to maintain them if they were there.
"We have to do this with the fans, without them you can build some kind of work where the game plan is in the foreground," he said.
“But I think it would be much more powerful to do it with the fans, because then the emotional side of the game, which will only be reached with the help of fans at the home playground.”
Mourinho believes that with stronger competitors, it is increasingly difficult to maintain the long periods of victory he knows from Chelsea, or that Liverpool has built up over the past three seasons.
But these are also key factors in determining whether the end of the period will achieve its goals, especially in regular games and neighboring laws, where the atmosphere of the field can change.
“ I believe that the direction of the original department is that this unbalanced valuation will be more and more difficult to beat because of what has become good. ”
“It’s important to be strong at home, and at the end of the season, the number of wins in home games is high. ”
“ I’m happy with the finals from home games lately, without the fans, but we need to get them back.
I see victory against Arsenal with the terrain full of Tottenham fans.
This is compassion that is built up gradually."
The buyers are excited about favorite lifestyle events in Lovely Banks
“ Greater is better, ” it seems, is the motto of new owners of huge real estate in the Lovely Banks neighborhood, which was recently sold at $1,270.
Interesting buyers looking for lifestyle property near the center of Geelong managed to view these 1.35 hectares of land, where there is a car shelter for 14 cars, a swimming pool and a view over the Corio River.
Joe Grgic, real estate agent in Harcourts, North-Geelong, said that offer to the property that Cuddihy Court 1 had been approved within 10 days of being placed on the market.
Broome Cottage in Ocean Grove back to sale
Home Opportunity for Isolation
"We received numerous offers from various parties," said Grgic.
"The property was sold to a home very excited."
There are four rooms on two floors, including a separate bathroom large enough to sleep.
The new owners have a choice of three rooms and can take advantage of an up - to - date kitchen and up - to - date area with a view over the pool.
"It was in how the property was composed, that it was three acres, and that it was in this place," said Grgic.
“ There came interested shoppers from Melbourne who were wondering what the property was in the middle of the country, but still with a rural setting.
“I have people who missed and buyers who are still looking.”
He said that the spacious storage area, which includes a double garage and a stand - alone shelter that is equipped with 10 to 12 vehicles, was perfect for industrial workers or for the storage of bicycles and trailers.
Counting Security Threatened in Iceland
“ Despite being appointed to the safest country in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter has been paranoid about his safety since he came to Reykjavík last year.”
This is how CBS’ detailed coverage of ambassadors from the United States of America in Iceland begins, with a large number of CBS publications from the U.S.
The CBS report claims that Gunter requested the United States Department of Foreign Affairs to grant him special permission to carry firearms.
Then, too, he should have wished for an armored car, as well as for ideas about a vest that could protect him from knife - tongue attacks.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs refused to state publicly whether the security of Gunters is a real threat to Iceland, but according to information from officials, Gunter has been repeatedly expressed that he is not in any particular danger.
Despite this, the U.S. Embassy recently announced to Iceland a full-time bodyguard, including in the morning of July 18, but CBS reports that it is done to satisfy Gunter’s concerns.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs does not express any serious security measures in connection with its mission, but it always states the objective of safety prevention.
The Council does not answer questions relating to Gunter’s wish to arm themselves and the Icelandic Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not want to tell whether the United States has formally wished for the ambassador to carry firearms, or whether it is usually said that it is not a matter of security for foreign agencies.
CBS, on the other hand, according to its Icelandic sources, that the request for this matter had never been submitted, and according to three U.S. officials, Gunter was caught up with these schemes, which could lead to domestic abuse in Iceland.
The CBS report also discusses the various problems that have been advocating the U.S. Embassy in Iceland since Gunter was appointed Ambassador last year, but he will already have replaced his host seven times.
Thus, the first viceroy is said to have prepared himself for his work for a long time and learned Icelandic only to have been denied the position at the last moment because Gunter “does not listen to him ” at their first meeting.
His successors have not been much better under Gunter's rule.
The government of the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs is told of the position in the Icelandic Embassy, but it is reluctant to intervene in matters that are closely related to the President.
In addition, Gunter is said to be reluctant to follow the various rules of foreign service and to respect the rule of power.
Gunter traveled to the United States in February to attend a conference in Washington, and is said to have refused to return to Iceland afterwards and have his temporary presence in his work for months, and that in the middle of a pandemic.
Gunter will even have wished to do his job in the distance and said he would not return to Iceland unless the Foreign Minister himself, Mike Pompeo, specifically wished for it.
According to information from the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs, Gunter had decided to take personal leave for the conference to be closed and the siron virus epidemic delayed further, but according to CBS’s sources, several people within the government will have asked Gunter to return to Iceland, but he did so not until May, following Pompeo’s contact with him and kindly asked him to return to the embassy in Iceland.
The CBS report also reports the unpopular Gunter in Iceland, especially in connection with the season where he calls the corona virus “the invisible Chinese virus” and has been highly criticised.
Gunter is one of many, almost inexperienced in the field of foreign service of ambassadors appointed during Donald Trump's reign.
Sachin Pilot vs. Ashok Gelot; Bharatiya Janata team says a government crisis in the state; Congressman wants a vote
Ashok Gelot said that if needed, the Congress would have to make a seat convention outside the home of the prime minister.
On Saturday, the day after peaceful protest by Raj Bhawan in Jaipur, Ashok Gelott, prime minister of Rajasthan, said that if necessary, the Congressmen would have to meet the president and material for a meeting outside the president’s home to bring the crucifix into the government to its conclusion.
At the Congressional Assembly meeting, Gehlot indicated that it was planned to give a vote to check whether the majority of the members of the Congress and of the confederations were with him in the power struggle.
"He said the government has the majority and wants to receive a vote," says Mahesh Joshi, the main party guard of the Congress, after the meeting.
The Congressional Meeting was held in a hotel where congressmen supporting Gelot stayed in the last days.
“ The secretary asked us to be ready for a longer stay at the hotel.
If necessary, he said, he would meet with the president and also hold peaceful protests outside the home of the prime minister," said a leader.
Prime Minister Rajasthan may convene the Congress and present the Congress Party to his majority, said General Rahul Gandhi on Friday, and indicated that the Bharatiya Janata Group's advice to overthrow Ashok Gelot's government had come to light.
“The country is now governed by the law and the constitution.
Governments are formed and serve with the authority of the people.
Bharatiya Janata's advice to overthrow the Rajasthan government has come to light.
This is an insult to the 80 million people of Rajasthan.
The prime minister must convene the Congress to bring the truth before the land," said Gandhi in a shivering on the Hindu.
Ashok Gelot, prime minister of Rajasthan, told the Congressmen on Saturday that he was prepared to meet the President of India to ensure that what he calls the “agriculture of Bharatiya Janata ” of delaying the declaration of confidence by vote does not succeed.
Geflot, who protested for hours at the home of the governor of Kalraj Mishra on Friday to press for a congress meeting, met with Congressmen and government on Saturday, and after the meeting, new proposals were made and approved by government.
Last night, Mishra asked Ghalot to reintroduce the meeting request and referred to six objections.
It will soon be sent to the governor.
Glott has accused the governor of delaying the Congress meeting, where he is under pressure to delay the vote of confidence in his government.
When Gelot met his government, the Missionary Committee of Bharatiya Janata, led by the leader of the Satish Poonia, and the head of the government of Gulab Chandra Kataria, met with the governor to discuss the status of COVID-19 in the state.

Spencer Grammer, a playwright outside Manhattan's restaurant
NEW YORK – The playwright Spencer Grammar said he was trying to calm the hottest man when he cut her arm and stuck her friend in the back outside the restaurant in New York City last Friday.
Grammer, 36 years old, said that she and her friend had done what everyone else would have done in the same situation that they had been trying to prevent the situation from getting worse when they were attacked.
Grammer and her 32-year-old friend were sitting at the outside of The Black Ant in East Village, Manhattan, about 23:30.
on Friday, when a man came up to them and demanded payment, but then he was shutting down the restaurant.
Grammer and her friend were wounded when they tried to “solve a conflict between an unknown man and other visitors at the scene, ” according to the police.
The man ran away after hurting Grammer’s right arm and stabbed her friend into the lumbar spine with an unknown tipped-off object, said a police officer.
No one's been arrested.
Grammer, who talks for Summer in "Rick and Morty" and played previously in the series "Greek" on ABC Family, is the daughter of "Frasier" star Kelsey Grammer and actress Doreen Alderman.
Grammer said that both her and her friend expected to recover quickly.
Neither of them suffered serious internal injuries, she said.
In a statement to the US Weekly, Grammer thanked those who responded in the field and the Bellevue Hospital staff who listened to them and referred to the “unbelievable struggle” of these workers at the coronation virus epidemic.
“It really touched us to get a chance to thank them personally,” said Grammer.
“I don’t want to be like McGregor and show my money...
I'm here to help people" – Chimaev after a historic night on UFC Fight Island – RT Sport News
The fighter Khamzat Chimaev from Russia is now named as the next star of UFC after having registered in the history of Fight Island, but he says he does not aim to flag his wealth in a violent way like Conor McGregor.
Chimaev carried the North Iranian Rhys McKee superintendent in their fights with a rolling face in Abu Dabí on Saturday night when he defeated his rival when three minutes and 9 seconds were over from the first round by making the hit dunk on him in the floor.
The winner recorded Chimaev’s name in UFC history books for the shortest time between wins in the modern history of the contest, with only 10 days since he defeated the British John Phillips in an equally decisive way, then intermittently.
Chimaev, who has a winning ratio of 8-0, received 50,000 U.S. dollars for tonight's presentation against McKee and has captured the attention of the MMA world so fully that he is now called "Khalib 2.0", which can be said to be inescapable comparison because of the great odds between the superiority of Chimaev and the UFC champion of lightweight and where he is born in Chechnya, which is near the Khabib high in Dagestan.
Despite newfound fame and financial gain, the vernacular Chimaev has said that he would not be inclined to flag his wealth like the MMA money machine Conor McGregor or his peer in the boxing world, Floyd Mayweather Jr.
“ I don’t just do this for myself, I do it for everyone I can help.
“ I don’t want to be like Mayweather and McGregor, show my money or something like that.
I want to help people," Chimaev replied when he was asked how he would use the bonus on Fight Island.
Among other things, he has noticed a team member named Conor McGregor and the active Twitter user, Dillon Danis, who wrote on the social media that he could “easyly” win Chimaev with an assignment.
It was not a toxic answer from the fighter named Borz, or a wolf in his tetansk mother tongue, who said that he would “paint Danis with his eyes closed. ”
Chimaev, who now lives in Stockholm, Sweden, after moving to the country at the age of 19, may not seem to be able to cope with his financial power, but he is clearly indifferent to his fighting skills.
“I can paint anyone...
How many fighters are in the rolling squad?
I can paint them all," he said.
“Give me 70 pounds [77 kg] of champ, 80 pounds [84 kg] of champ, and I will grind them both the same day.”
Israel continues to protest the Prime Minister’s reaction to the pandemic
JERUSALEM (AP) — Thousands of Israel protested against prime ministers in the land on Saturday and were the greatest protests besides the official residence of Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem.
The protests have lasted for a few weeks, but they began because the critics feel that the government's neglect to respond to the siron virus epidemic is expected after initially to contain the threat of the virus.
Netanyahu’s accusation of corruption has further promoted the protest.
"Bibi, go home," said one of the Protestants.
The second volume said: “Everyone sees that Caesar has lost his clothes. ”
Also, hundreds of Protestants gathered outside the beachhouse of Netanyahu in the prosperous town of Caesarea.
Last week, the police used water guns to scatter groups in Jerusalem.
After what has been called the rapid and unorganized reopening of the economy in May, the average number of new cases increased by day to 2000.
The economy of the country has been hit by the virus limitations and unemployment has increased by nearly 20%.
Controversies say that the government’s financial aid has nothing to do with it.
The protest took place in the shadow of a trial of corruption against Netanyahu, which began again in the month.
Hearing begins in January.
He is accused of fraud, trustlessness, and bribery in a series of scandals.
Hundreds of Protestants meet in downtown Los Angeles to show agreement with Protestants in Portland
LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) — About 300 protesters met in downtown Los Angeles on Saturday afternoon to support two - month - old movements in Portland, Oregon, where they focus on federal police after protesters.
Similar Protestant meetings took place in many parts of the United States, including Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, and New York.
The protests in Los Angeles were organized by the Refuse Fascism and Youth Liberation Front groups.
The team went to Los Angeles Police headquarters at First Street and Main Street and then to the Greater City District Maintenance Center.
The participants also moved to the Alameda freeway on Route 101, but they left it later.
Part of the people were seen breaking windows in federal buildings in the city center, and humiliating words were written on federal marks.
At least one person was arrested in the protests.
50 people in Moscow at the Eid Festival and no prayer gatherings in Eidgah, state government in Karnataka
The festival Eid-ul-Asha, or Bakrid, will take place on July 31st and August 1st.
The Government of Karnataka has published that only 50 can congregate in mosques to pray for Eid-ul-Asha, and have banned prayer meetings at Eidgah and other sites due to the corona virus epidemic.
Visitors wishing to pray in Mosque must wear masks and stay away, as instructed by AB Ibrahim, the council leader on minority groups and Wakf.
The command states that the Hilal Committee has decided that the Eid-ul-Azha Festival, also called or Bakrid, will be held on 31 July in the Udup, Dakshina Kannada and Kodag, but on 1 August in other parts of the state.
The order states that while prayer meetings are one of the most important rituals of Muslims at the Bakrid Festival, such events at Eidgah and other places will be banned because of the COVID-19 epidemic.
However, prayers will be allowed in Mosques, assuming that no more than 50 are participating at once.
If there are more than this if the hours of prayer are exchanged, the commissioner says.
There is no place for prayer meetings, such as meeting houses, social centers, or “Shadi Mahal, ” to be held.
The Karnataka government authorises the opening of temples, mosques and other places of worship to those who wish to pray from June 8, to ensure that the protection of the disease by means of the COVID-19 is ensured.
The U.S. ambassador wants an armed bodyguard.
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, Ambassador of the United States of Iceland, considers his life threatened in this country and wants to carry weapons.
At the beginning of 2020, the U.S. Embassy announced in response to a lifeguard 'bodyguard' in Icelandic newspapers and actually used the English word bodyguard in the advertisement.
According to the Kveik sources, the main reason why these jobs were announced is that Jeffrey Ross Gunter believes his life is threatened in Iceland.
The source of the fire has been discussed with sources in Iceland and abroad, who are convinced by the ambassador that he is in great danger, and the reason is that he is of Jewish descent.
Every threat is not as clear as it is, but the correspondents of Khlyk said that Islamic terrorists had been called a threat.
The CBS television station discussed the issue on its website this morning and has reported to the Washington authorities that Gunter is persecuted, insists on carrying his own weapons, getting a punitive vest, and armed escorts as well as bulletproof automobiles.
According to CBS sources, Gunter has been withdrawn to say that there is no threat and that the "bodyguard" advertisement is only for the purpose of sleeping Gunter.
On the basis of the information obtained from the Agency, the positions had not been taken up at the end of June, but the application was postponed to February.
On the basis of the report from the United States, no formal notice has been received from the United States Mission because of these changes.
No formal request has been made for increased care or for a permit for lifeguards to be armed outside the walls of the embassy.
It is clear from the Icelandic Law that this is not permitted except with a special authority from the State Department.
There is no record of any threat to the health of those affected by Fire in the management system.
The latest threat to the state police is somewhat decisive about terrorism.
There are no examples of terrorism in Iceland and no evidence that terrorist or extreme groups are working here.
The prerequisites for allowing the weapons of the foreign embassy’s lifeguards on the streets of cities and towns in Iceland are not available, according to the Kleiks sources.
Gunter paid considerable attention here in the country when he divided the President of the United States and called the COVID-19 "China Virus".
At that time, he had the American and Icelandic flag.
Radio operator in Seattle mocking Trump's response to protests now says that after Starbucks coffeehouse under his apartment was destroyed — RT USA News
Paul Gallant has had a new perspective on violent protests after mocking President Donald Trump of the United States in June for saying that the anarchists were burning and robbing Seattle City.
The only thing that needed to be heard was that the director’s home was closer.
"I feel like I have to buy guns because this will clearly continue to happen," Gallant said on Twitter on Saturday night after he saw that the wreckers had "breasted" the Starbucks coffeehouse on the bottom floor of his apartment house.
"It looks like a street party at the bottom of my street, very angry now."
The situation was completely different when Trump complained last month about the city manager Seattle’s allowing violent protesters to take over the city.
“These liberal democrats are powerless, ” said the president.
“The terrorists burn and rob our cities, and they just think it’s wonderful, even death.”
Gallant, a co-controller of the “Danny & Gallant” part of ESPN, Seattle, replied with a hustle and bustle: “Go through there for inquisitions last night and see no burning, robbery or death.
Gallant said last night that the police advised the residents to stay away from his apartment building, where explosives could be found in the damaged Starbucks coffeehouse.
He published pictures of the damage and said, “Well done, idiots, ” and noted that he had also seen fire a few lengths away.
"I have no idea what's going on, but the cat and I are going to find out."
The twist did not go past people who ridiculed Gallant for his previous opinion and chirped messages such as "Just relax," and "Yah, maybe Trump was right."
Jason Rantz, a second broadcaster in Seattle, said, “I don’t think we’re finally going on this poll we talked about. ”
Gallant laughed: “Awake and saw that a lot of people were squeezing at me. I laughed. ”
He said he stood by his previous statement as he had walked through the Chaz administrative area of the Anarchist and though it was not as bad as it would have been.
He said, "So it was burned and robbed after all."
White Lines star Laura Haddock, 34 years old, in an apartment search with his 28-year-old lover, Tom Rhys Harries
Laura Haddock and her boyfriend, Tom Rhys Harries, began together at the filming site of the White Lines, which discusses sighs and falls on Ibiza, but in the search of homes over the past week their second and quieter, far away from the pleasure of the party island.
The couple, who play siblings in the Netflix series popular, were seen looking at a magnificent rural settlement in Oxfordshire, which is available for sale on 1.2 million pounds.
They came to the area of the Range Rover, which was Laura, 34, drove, wearing jeans and white shirts, and met a real estate store there, which led them on a tour of the five - room house.
In the White Lines, which was recorded last fall, Laura played the role of Zoe Walker, who explores the darker side of Ibiza as she investigates the murder of her brother, Alex, who is played by Tom, 28 years old.
Their relationship was not established until this month, less than a year from the end of the six - year marriage of Laura and Sam Claflin, known from the Hunger Games.
Together, the four - year - old son Pip and the daughter Margot are two - year - old.
When they reported on the divorce in August last, Claflin, 34, wrote on Instagram: “I have decided to divorce; we understand in love, friendship, and with deep respect each other; and we will continue our cooperation on the upbringing of our children.
Laura and Sam met first in 2011 in an audition, and Sam, who has also played in Peaky Blinders, described their wedding in 2013 as “an almost greatest achievement of my life. ”
Before Laura got her part in the White Lines, she had played in the previous Inbetweeners movie, and in the crime drama The Capture from BBC, which was shown last year, where she played lawyer Hannah Roberts.
Tom played a role in the second Inbetweeners movie and in the series Brittania from Sky.
Counting too early to claim another wave here on land
A health - care expert at the National Medical Association says too soon to claim another wave of the epidemic.
Three new domestic infections were detected at the National Hospital’s viral ward yesterday and are frequented by dozens of people.
Two domestic infections were detected on Thursday, one in a male aged 30 and the other in a male aged 20.
No infection had been detected since the beginning of the month.
Yesterday, then, three more internal transmissions were detected, one of which had been at the Rey Cup in Laugardal.
In a conversation with a news agency, John K. Johannsson, a government information officer, said that fewer people had to be exposed because of this infection, but it was originally thought.
The second infection is in a person who came to the country from abroad on July 15.
At that time, rules on so - called home invasion had been taken into account.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, a health - care expert at the National Institute of Medicine, says that the person followed the old course.
His vision was negative when he came to the land, but he became ill when he was isolated and six were infected.
They're all on their way to show, but two of them are starting to show signs.
The third infection is then linked to the older man who was diagnosed on Thursday and who has been infected with it.
It has been found that there is a new variant of the coronin virus that has not been detected before in this country.
“We don’t know exactly where this type of virus comes from, but we haven’t seen it before.
Whoever is considered to have carried the virus to the land had been in Israel but also in other European countries."
It believes too early to claim that the so - called other wave of the epidemic has begun here on land, just as other countries in Europe fear it.
“ While the majority are still operational, it is not eating.
But we're on our toes and we're watching, thinking about ways to react if something like that could start."
Megan Fox Expresses About the Relationship
Megan Fox says he found his twin in the rapper Machine Gun Kelly.
“ As soon as I met him and looked into his eyes, I knew.
I am interested in constellations, and I immediately knew that my twin room was talking about," says Fox, 34.
“ Two - letter souls are when the soul has reached a level of existence enough to be able to divide into two different bodies at the same time, ” Fox explained.
“ So we are two halves of the same soul, I think.
I told him as soon as we met.
I found it right away."
“ Once we had known him for two days, I asked him to meet me at lunch, and I taught him about the constellations and asked him in his life.
I decided to go to the depth immediately."
Machine Gun Kelly takes the same line, but they met on film.
“ I was just hanging outside her trailer and hoping to see her.
She has the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen."
Only two months have passed since Fox divorced his husband up to ten years of age, Brian Austin Green.
They have three sons together.
Kanye apologizes to Kim
The American musician, the tycoon, and the president - forwarder Kanye West have apologized to Kim Kardashian West for publicly falling down on the family’s personal affairs.
“I would like to apologize to my wife, Kim, for having talked about private matters publicly, ” he wrote on Twitter last night.
Their relationship has been in serious disrepute, but Kanye has recently gone to a great deal of social media and, at a mass meeting that he held last Monday, he talked about including his daughter’s birth in North West and said that he had almost killed her.
Kim then stepped forward on Wednesday and published a message to his followers on Instagram, where she discussed her husband’s illness, which is diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
Kardashian West has not previously spoken publicly about his husband’s illness, saying that it is due, among other things, to their children and the right of Kanye to privacy when his health comes.

Increased weight in protests against racial discrimination in the United States
Opposers have wandered the streets of many cities in the United States to draw attention to racial rights.
Objections have lasted for two months in Portland, Oregon, since May 25, when George Floyd was killed in the Minneapolis police force in Minnesota.
The Trump government has sent FBI officers to Portland, and thus still denounced the protest.
The protesters now also object to the presence of the federal police in the city.
In Seattle on Saturday, police used bombs and tear gas, arresting 45 people, after protests to support protests in Portland resolved to violence.
According to the police, over 20 police officers were injured.
One died Saturday night in Austin, Texas, when a gun was launched into the Black Lives Matter range.
The media say that the man may have walked up to a car - armed rifle before he was shot.
“The point is, it’s terrible that someone should die in protest,” said Steve Adler, Mayor Austin, in a statement.
Adler said that he was “tormentless and unspoken. ”
In Lousville, Kentucky, a group of armed Protestants demanded justice in the case of Breonna Taylor, a black woman who died in Louisville when police broke into her home, with a warrant to enter without knocking, and shot her.
Taylor’s boyfriend had first shot the police, thinking they were burglars.
One policeman has been fired because of Taylor's death, but the other officers have not been brought to trial.
The leadership of the NFAC group, armed by a group of black rebels who have participated in the protests, calls for more transparency in a police investigation into Taylor's murder.
According to information from the police, three members of the NFAC were wounded on Saturday when an accidental gunshot occurred in the rebel army.
Possibilities of group infection at the time of dispatch
Five have been diagnosed with Covid-19 infection this week outside border screening.
Two of them were diagnosed with previously unseen virus variants, and the origin of three of the five infections seems to be completely unclear.
It is not certain whether the individuals have been infected by a tourist who has left the country or by a nonsymptom who has probably infected much more.
A local pathologist says that a possible group infection may be associated with one infection.
Two were diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country last Thursday, with each type of virus.
The origin of infection is still unclear.
Three were then diagnosed with the virus yesterday; one of them has been infected by other people diagnosed on Thursday; the other one came to the country on July 15, and probably became infected out, but the third one is also infected with vague origins.
After sequencing in the elsenian gene analysis, the two individuals who were diagnosed with the virus and associated with its new variant that has not been identified in the country before.
Kamilla Josephsdóttir, a National Disease Control Expert and a local pathologist, says that an Icelandic genetic analysis is now examining the most likely occurrence of this type of virus.
“The second case was a similar virus that has been used in Switzerland but not quite the same.
They're going to look at this and try to map it better and lead the odds of which part of the world the infection comes from," she says.
"However, it seems to be this side of the Atlantic."
Thus, the infection is unrelated to the two that came up at the beginning of July and were traced to the United States.
Do you assume that this new species has arrived outside rather than from within?
"Yes, this is different from what has been found here before that there is really no chance that this was something to grind here," Kamilla replied.
“All odds are that these individuals somehow got in touch with a person who has just arrived somewhere outside, without knowing it for themselves.”
She says that at present there is no indication of where this new virus could have come to the country.
“ Of course, it could be a tourist who has left the country again, but it could also be someone who does not get symptoms and does not realize that he has been infected, and naturally more infections could follow.
We'll be on our toes the next few days to watch it."
“This is not the time for a clear group infection.
But there are individuals who have been infected with one of the infections yesterday, who have symptoms and have already been exposed to them," continues Kamilla.
“We don’t have the results yet.
So this could possibly be a group infection in the process of sailing."
Do you assume that there is now a social detoxification?
“ It’s not impossible.
It hasn't been recently, but it's not impossible because we don't know who has been carrying this infection in these people, who were diagnosed on Tuesday and yesterday."
Could it be said that there is now a new wave of the virus?
“ No, not yet.
But we need to be very alert, and we need to keep that in mind, even though there are so many limitations to how much we can view people.
We don't take samples from asymptomatic people, but first we're getting infection that seems undetectable, we need to be given a little looser hands by taking samples from people with symptoms," she says.
Thus, it can be expected that the disease and viral wards of the National Hospitals will give in to the demonstrations in the next few days to try to map the situation in this country more closely.
Does the National Hospital have the ability to increase domestic exposure and provide for screening at the border?
“ No limit, no.
Therefore, there must be some basis for a sample to be taken in individuals who are not in the screening dossiers; the individual must be sick and show symptoms or symptoms or have had symptoms and suspicions of contacting someone who has just arrived in the country or something like that," says Kamilla.
It notes that infection is still under way and that there is now much work to be done to obtain information about the individual’s journeys.
It says that the origin of the internal diseases seems undetectable, but it does not rule out any of those who have been infected with them being able to provide evidence that eventually leads the infectious community to the original infections.
The feasting place that most people know of, but one of them thinks is the best.
Not everyone is in the clear location of the restaurant Bjargarsteinn, and he probably has more fans abroad than he is here in the country, if you can tell us about him on TripAdvisor and other sites.
It has been heard by people who have flown into the country to visit him no wonder.
Mountainside Spice daughter, food blogger and cookbook writer, attacked Bjargarstein on the days and observed water of delight
“ I don’t know where to start because the restaurant Bjargarsteinn on the Foundation is just a wonderful place out there.
The house's history is one of the sweetest things I know, the food up to ten, don't look at the worse end and wonderfully entertained servants!" says Berglind.
“ Gunn, the owner of Bjargarstein, enchanted each animal’s right on the feet of another before us.
My wife and I sat with our girls all night eating, so I must say, "How good the food was," Berglind adds.
“ The house where the restaurant is run is an old apartment house that was moved to the whole area of Grundarförððinn.
Present owners drove their eyes into this house for sale on Akranes, found a beautiful seabed on the ground floor, and made the dream come true.
You can read more about the history of the house on Bjargarstein's website."
“ The houses and all the borders of Bjargarstein are unique.
This has been a gathering of differences from the whole family, and it certainly has its place in the home.
On the upper floor there is a lounge and a really choice and a home to enter this wonderful restaurant.
The quality and the cooking then are not hidden, and it is evident that much is being done to enchant tasteful and beautiful restaurants," says Berglind, and as far as the pictures are concerned, nothing lies.
Sebastian Vettel joins the Red Bull, saying that the F1 star will join Max Verstappen for a single team member.
"This is done no, I'm afraid, and Sebastian is clear."
The F1 will start again around the next weekend with two consecutive races on the Silverstone Road.
Lewis Hamilton can increase his leadership after winning two of the first three Grand Prix races from the start of the sport back into the Crown Virus epidemic.
Vettel will hope for a better performance from the Ferrari car that has been far from its best to this.
Mick Fleetwood praises Peter Green: "His music will live"
Mick Fleetwood praised Peter Green, a member of Fleetwood Mac, who died today at the age of 73.
Green was a founder of this historic rock band, along with formerly mentioned Mick and Jeremy Spencer.
Although Green left the band in 1970, before reaching her climax with records such as Rumours, Mick has praised this former band member and assured fans that “his music will live on. ”
"For me and all the former and present member of Fleetwood Mac, losing Peter Green a great moment of memory," said Fleetwood in conversation with PA.
“Peter was the man who founded the Fleetwood Mac band with me, John McVie and Jeremy Spencer.
No one has ever joined Fleetwood Mac without having deep respect for Peter Green and his talents, and the fact that the music is shining brightly and being carried by unwavering passion."
"Peter, I will miss you, but be sure your music will live," added the 73-year-old rock star.
“ I thank you for asking if I wanted to be your drummer all those years ago.
We did well, and we did quite well in the course of music that so many have enjoyed.
"God be with you, my dear friend... with love and respect, Mick Fleetwood."
Green’s death was confirmed by Swan Turton’s attorney’s office: “The family of Peter Green reported with great sorrow that Peter died this weekend, peacefully asleep.
A further statement will be published in the days to come."
Green leaves behind a daughter, Rosebud Samuels-Greenbaum, whom he had with his ex-wife, Jane Samuels.
Green founded Fleetwood Mac with Mick Fleetwood and Jeremy Spencer, but the band was originally named "Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac Featuring Jeremy Spencer".
However, the singer left the band in 1970, after four records.
Fleetwood Mac was going to receive a lot of praise and will enjoy worldwide popularity after others were added to the group, including Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks on Rumours and Tusk.
Prince Jehoakim’s feeling continued
Joakim Danaprin, the younger son of Margaret Thoriums of Queen Dana and Henry’s name Danaprin, is still in a hospital in Toulouse, France, where he operated on the day before yesterday because of blood clots in the brain.
According to the Danish national radio, DR, the Danish court's spokesman says that it is uncertain how long the prince, who is 51 years old, will be in the hospital, but his feelings are stable.
According to a report from DR, the effect of blood clots on the health of the prince is now being examined.
This is indicated by the doctor Peter Qvortrup Geisling, who deals with medical issues for DR, that the consequences of a blood clot in the brain often do not occur until days after surgery.
“ It can be anything from negligible symptoms to half - life, memory problems, or difficulties with expression, ” says Geisling.
He says the prince could wait for months for him to be reinstated.
Joakim Danaprins, called the full name Joachim Holger Waldemar Christian, is also a Count of Monpezat, who stayed on the family vineyard, Château de Cayx in southern France when he got sick on Friday night.
He was first hospitalized in the town of Cahors, which is a short distance from the ranch, but then moved to the University Hospital in Toulouse, where he underwent surgery for blood clots in the brain.
Google Pixel 4 can create the galaxy
Double optical zooming enables the zooming of Pixel 4 to be seen at a three-dimensional level, thus rendering a better contrast in the background with a face adjustment than in the previous Pixel-space, which relied upon software to achieve these so-called "boeh" effects.
To demonstrate the quality of the camera, Google’s mythical photographer Annie Leibovitz was invited to discuss his experience of photography with Pixel 4 in the last 12 months.
Computer studies are still at the forefront of all aspects of Google's new smartphones, and in this phone, "autonomous photography" is new to improve HDR+ settings by combining up to nine different images.
New two-device lighting controls offer different lighting and shadow environments and enable users to preview HDR+ in real time.
The phone also relies on computer studies to offer better automatic whitening and to improve night vision, which is so sensitive that it can capture the galaxy in the night sky.
In addition to the other camera software, Pixel 4 Soli “racing slab” displays on the front of a phone that detects Motion Sense motion so that users can skip track, turn off timing, turn off an alarm clock or turn off the phone by waving their hand.
All calculations of Motion Sense are carried out on the device instead of connecting the Internet and the same applies to enhanced Google helmets, where the technician is now stressing to shorten the response time and improve the personal protection of users.
Further emphasis on Google’s full use of machine learning skills has also resulted in a new voice recording app that converts live audio without sending data on the Internet.
The app is currently only available in English, but more languages are expected.
Pixel 4 will also be the first phone to support Google Stadium, a cloud playground to be launched on November 19th in the United States, but still after reporting on Australia’s date.
In addition to a new Pixel phone, Google also introduced a new Pixelbook Go Chromebook computer and another generation of Google Pixel Buds hearing aids.
The new Bluetooth 5.0 smartphones expected next year are completely wireless and have sound adjustments that listen to the environment and constantly adjust the sound to the extent of the clarity.
The new Bluetooth 5.0 smartphones are completely wireless and set the volume to match the noise around you.
Google also announced an update of its connected Wi-Fi home in the Nest WiFi line with a special bone, along with many basic sites working together to improve wireless connections within the home.
The new Wi-Fi system, which will record the Nest name, doubles its predecessor and adds built-in audio and speaker to use the Google Wizard at each base of the home.
It is sold in Australia November 5th and costs 399 estrals for the bone and one Wi-Fi point or 549 dollars for two Wi-Fi points.
Google Home Mini has also been updated, but a new $79 Nest Mini improves the sound quality by double the bass and has got a built-in wall fixture.
All Google smart speakers will have a new call system feature for communication between devices in the home as well as the ability to call Nest Mini outside the home using the Google Home app.
CLUE: The final day of the original Juventus Department can seal the victory
Here's a review of the football in Europe on Sunday:
This is the last day of the season, and there is still a lot to be done: participation in the Championships and in the European Union, the last two base seats and the Gold Choir prize.
Manchester United, Chelsea, and Leicester are fighting for the last two seats in the Championships for second place champions Liverpool and Manchester City.
One stage separates the three past, and Leicester receives the United.
Wolverhampton and Tottenam are fighting to secure a seat in the European Union.
Aston Villa, Watford and Bournemouth want to avoid the two base seats remaining at the side of Norwich, which is already dead.
When one game is left, Jamie Vardy from Leicester is the highest player with 23 points, two more than Danny Ings from Southampton and three more than Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang from Arsenal.
The task of getting up to the original department begins with Swansea receiving Brentford in their first predisposition.
Fulham's playing Cardiff in the other front colours that start on Monday.
Leeds and West Bromwich already got out of the next squad.
Juventus can win his own valuation by obtaining the ninth title in Serie A, with victory over Sampdoria.
Thus, Bianconeri would score seven points after Inter Milan, which is second place when two games are left.
On the other hand, Lecce needs to work in Bologna in order to have a further hope of staying away from falling down into a division.
Lecce is four points behind Genoa, which is in 17th place and is one game ahead.
A polecatcher “saw throwing a bottle of beer into a sale” in Devon
A pole - hunter threw a bottle of beer into a cell when he interrupted the fishing line, according to a charity gathering.
Pictures taken at Hope's Nose near Torquay seem to show a man on a rock that throws an object towards an animal.
Duncan Kenny, who took the pictures, said that the gray seller had been fishing when the pole hunter emptied out of a bottle and threw it in the back of the animal.
Kenny called this “abominable and careless behavior. ”
He said he was picking up garbage at this beautiful place in Devon last Sunday morning, along with other people in the seal - protection company Seal Project when he witnessed the attack.
“ The soul tried to get on the fishing line, ” he said.
“ The barber stretched the beer, emptied the bottle, and threw it into the seller.
"The bottle fell on the back of the seller and he swam away."
Teaching said that “which goes better is selling a strong - built animal ” than that the seller had simply been doing what was natural to him.
“By throwing a glass bottle into him, you are stopping him on his fishing, ” he said.
The Seal Project Company said that this was “not an isolated incident” and that it had recently received “many notifications of this aggressive behaviour”.
According to Facebook, volunteers collected 12 bags of garbage in the Hope's Nose collection on Sunday and that there were “many examples of antisocial behavior”.
All sales are protected by the laws for the protection of seals, and people are asked to stay away from them.
Rice from the Christian Poll in Laxá in Dals
The first hundred were caught in Laxá in the valleys of the late part of the day.
It was the work of Arnor Isförð Gudmundsson.
He had put in the horror of a Christian poll this morning, and it was six inches [89 cm].
After noon, he was again on the Christian platform, thinking of a story that he had heard of the slowness of the procession that often followed.
With this in mind, he accompanied Collie Dog and threw himself over a Christian poll.
Soon he got a take, and as he tells himself.
“ After about five seconds, he cleaned himself completely, and I realized that it was the meter.
I was stressed out because I had 11 pounds of tea.
Usually I'm stuck on fish, but I had this one for forty minutes.
Actually, he was quite comfortable.
Took a few trips up and down the pool, and then I got to strand him, and that was a great feeling.
Grab my pole and jump on it.
He measured ten inches [102 cm] and I doubled him," said a bold hunter at the Thirandjig hunting house in Laxá, Daalum, in conversation with Sporda attacks.
Arnor's like no beginner when it comes to a hundred calls.
That was his eighth.
He received such fish in Mixing, Black Sea, Black Forest, Kjarrá, two in Langadalsá, and one in East Rangoon.
According to Arnor, there is a fine fishing in Laxá, Daalum.
The cave that will finish at noon tomorrow comes with 35 salmon, and our man has eighteen of them.
We expect a great flood because of Hannah
Hanna, the first hurricane of the Atlantic this year, reached a country in Texas, U.S.A., last night.
Hannah quickly lost power and became a storm, yet much rain has taken place in the area and is expected to receive vast floods.
Thus, up to a quarter of an inch [30 cm] of rain is expected in one day, but in certain places it could reach as much as two inches [46 cm], according to the AP newsmagazine.
In particular, there is a warning about dangerous rapid floods that could occur as a result of rain.
The area where Hanna reached the country has been affected by the large distribution of the new corona virus there.
In addition, she has gone ashore and caused damage.
Now there are at least 43,700 people without electricity.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, peeked about the hurricane tonight and said it was important that people listen to experts and follow instructions.
See below for a photo taken by AP newscaster this morning.
House burned, stores robbed and inboard damaged
Over sixty more are dead and sixty more wounded after the attack in the village of Masteri in the Darfur district of Sudan yesterday.
The attack “was the most recent series of serious security incidents in the last few weeks in which houses were burned, traded and marketed, and damaged, ” says the United Nations Office on Human Rights in the capital city of Cartum, which was dispatched today.
Abdalla Hamdok, prime minister of Sudan, has published the announcement that security forces will be sent to the war zone to “protect the inhabitants and the harvest. ”
Only two days have passed since an unknown army in the area killed at least 20 civilians, including children, in another attack.
"The stagnation of violence in different parts of the Darfur region is leading to increased upheavals, putting agriculture at risk and threatening people's lives and lives," says the United Nations.
The conflicts in Darfur, western Sudan, began in 2003 when rebels, most of them Arabs, rose up against the governor of Kartuum.
The forces of government and Arab troops, who tried to kill the rebellion, have been accused of widespread cruelty, while some 300,000 were killed in the fighting, according to the United Nations ’ assessment.
Omas al-Bashir, who was thrown out of a chair as leader of Sudan, is wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes, genocides, and crimes against humanity in Darfur.
Meanwhile, new governments in Sudan are now trying to negotiate peace with major rebel groups.
A television news reporter thanks an audience for noticing cancerous bumps
TAMPA, Florida (AP) — A Florida television newscaster thanks a attentive audience for noticing her neck nod and e - mailing her that she should be checked.
Victoria Price, a WFLA newsman in Tampa, took this advice and became diagnosed with cancer.
Price said on Twitter that she was going to surgery on Monday to remove the tumour, thyroid, and some lymph nodes.
“ The doctor said it was spreading, but not too much, and we are hoping that this will be my first and last operation, ” she said.
The audience e - mailed Price last month and told her that the nod reminded her of the nod she had had.
Price, a 28 - year - old researcher, said during the week that her screenplay was “8 in your team. ”
“ But the role was recently mixed when the audience joined ME, and I couldn’t be more grateful, ” said Price.
“ I’ll be forever grateful to the woman who started sending me an e - mail, a completely unknown woman.
She had no obligation to do so, but she did so anyway.
Speaking of being with someone in the team."
Part of the Jeronimo Open Space outpost temporarily shut down after two assaults of coyotes — CBS Los Angeles
Two plain wolves near the Oso Creek footpath on Jeronimo road in Mission Viejo on Saturday morning, and closing on the road needed to be temporary.
Laura Wittmer says he sees a smooth wolf almost every morning and usually she tries to avoid them just, but on Saturday morning one came straight to her and bit her foot.
The route has been closed during the investigation.
The Viejo City Mission stated: "Today, two different players reported that a flat wolf had bitten a human being. The animal welfare service Mission Viejo is working on the issue in collaboration with the fish and animal division, and part of Jeronimo Open Space has been closed. Be careful and watchful when you are traveling where there is a lot of wild animals."
Wittmer tried to beat the coyote off with a bottle of water.

Racial objectors collide with Seattle Police
On Sunday, conflicts in Seattle between police and Protestants against racial hatred ended with the arrest of a large number of people, but dissatisfaction among the public because of the US President Donald Trump’s plan to send a large number of federal policemen into major cities.
Objections to racial hatred and police violence have erupted following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in Minneapolis, May.
On Saturday’s protests, protesters in Seattle cut wheelcars and broke windows in trailer homes, causing police to declare riots and empty the streets with pepper sprays and flares.
Conventioners also set sail on a building site for a future juvenile detention centre.
The police said they arrested 45 people, but 21 policemen had been injured.
The protests were conducted in support of the protests that took place in the neighboring city of Portland, Oregon.
Portland is in the spotlight after Trump ordered the very controversial radical actions of the federal police, in the unthankful local authorities, who say the police use excessive force.
Conventional tours have been held in Austin, Texas, as well as Louisville, Kentucky, New York, Omaha, and Nebraska, Oakland, and Los Angeles, California, and Richmond, Virginia.
In Austin, the capital of Texas, one was shot to death in armed conflicts in the city center on Saturday night, according to the police.
Contrary to protests, Trump's struggle for re-election in November is becoming increasingly difficult, and has developed a tough police policy.
