The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods ....
I'm #PRS_ORG# Big customer and so it's no problem for me.
Just need a number or instruction that I should attach to the package so that it can be traced back by you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
To be honest, I find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and order it for the better price or is there another possibility of crediting?
In principle, I also think that children should not be encouraged to take on a parent role for their little siblings.
However, I think big siblings also do well to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Take a look, help them out, bring the bottle, etc.
Thus, they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved with.
As long as they can still be enough children, I see no problem.
If your K1 is working alone for the short time and it's okay for him, that's good.
You can best assess for yourself whether this fits your children.
It's not like he's supposed to wrap K2 and accompany him to sleep for hours.
Legally, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps, therefore, the psychologist's statement also comes.
Because if something really should happen like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc. it would actually be too much responsibility for K1, to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is, of course, your discretion ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime / thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the whole action, but the title partout doesn't come to mind anymore maybe someone here knows...
The story was of fear and therapy.
At the beginning of history, an animal caretaker commits suicide by overburdening himself with food and going to his gangsters.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a brief investigation of his therapists, is operating a clinic where he treats patients in fear.
The Commissioner has a little niece who is also afraid (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There is more suicide and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the place of suicide and document and put the photos into the internet before each suicide.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist conducts some kind of underground therapy group where the patient is transplanted a chip that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain and ultimately puts the patients in the most extreme way.
(a woman jumps out of the window another drives herself to death)
This fear is referred to in the book as "the fight".
In the end, there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
That's the rough story I'm pretty sure the book was written in original by a French author / author.
If this action is known to someone or even someone can betray the title of the book, I would be very pleased.
Oh, yeah, I didn't have the password for Wlan.
Must first contact my husband.
But that can take some time.
What steps must I take after that?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded ?
Child, 4 j., Splitter under the thumbnail
Child, four years old, has wood splitter over the entire length under the thumb nail (outside).
I tried to drag him with a pinzette.
Very hard to grasp.
Didn't work and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
Tomorrow it goes to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
By combining digital decoder and sound module on a circuit board, we reach dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can therefore be installed in almost every locomotive of the track gauges H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm "sugar cube" speaker and sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multi protocol decoder.
He controls the DCC data format as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In DCC format, 14 to 128 driving stages are as natural as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders report to a suitable digital centre completely automatically.
He masters all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom® the CV values can be read out on the main track with appropriate control stations.
For headquarters that can program only the CVs of 1-255 exist auxiliary registers.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 driving stages at 255 addresses.
Three more Motorola® addresses enable 16 functions to be triggered.
A built-in programming mode also makes reprogramming possible with the venerable control unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic registration at Mfx®-compatible headquarters.
The LokSound 5 decoder recognizes the Märklin® brake tracks as well as the ZIMO® HLU brake commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
It is also possible to brake with DCC brake components or with DC voltage.
He also stops at a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC pendulum train automatic allows the automatic commuting between two railway stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analogue DC and AC lanes.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to promote booster vaccination
Getting new Omikron cases of politics and science in the UK.
By the new year, therefore, all qualifying adults in England should receive a vaccination offer.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make even faster progress with the Corona revamping vaccinations in view of the rapid rise in Omikron figures than has so far been achieved.
Every adult in England should be given the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen.
So far, the target date was at the end of January.
The UK Government will provide additional support to speed up vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In view of the Omikron variant, we are faced with an emergency, which is why vaccination protection needs to be strengthened urgently, said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose.
"Let's get mad at you now," said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 other Omikron cases were registered in Great Britain, which increased the total to 3137.
Compared to the day before, this was an increase of 65 percent. dpa
is the full amount refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
I am in favour of everyone presenting themselves with pronouns
I got rid of an application.
Today the invitation came to a conversation by e-mail.
I want to respond to the e-mail.
Unfortunately, the name is not a "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I Googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the e-mail now.
Can anyone help me?
** I'm a foreigner and don't want to have any officials step over my feet either.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
Have a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them go.
Just the one I bought today won't go
Obviously, the chair had an unobtrusive lack of sales.
How else can such a cushion damage occur after 9 months?
First tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
But it has been working for approx.
No more 14 days.
So I always bought the last books through the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8 of them.
But there was no more.
Now they are available again and I want you to add 2 chairs to the order and charge me that.
[CW] The feeling if I can't help.
Content Warning: I will write something in detail about domestic violence here.
I just need to write something about the soul.
I (21) come into contact more often for professional reasons with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence.
A topic that really comes close to me, and unfortunately too often, is that many victims are not being helped or think we could not help them.
I am quite clear that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than if I can do nothing in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in conversation under four eyes, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing I can't reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment to get the kids out of this.
What I always want to make clear to everyone is partly very close to the tears themselves, everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to take violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But this never makes it easier.
Please, always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so unbelievably important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What does the "League of Legends" series do?
Lots of fantasy, many complicated names, a stunning presentation: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently started on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the two seasons already announced?
Basketball League: Derby-Debachel of the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg near the Merlins Crailsheim
At least at Youngster Johannes Patrick was out.
Nothing again: For the second time in not even three months the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our stomachs."
But it did not lie down after the game - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the basketball league.
In which more than the naked result disappointed the manner of appearance.
The deputy is called a statistics that express the entire dilemma: The three-quota was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all of the young John Patrick) with a saw and write 31 attempts - still questions?
The answer delivered John Patrick: "We were simply not concentrated enough after the Tenerife victory, and did not implement what we trained".
It's like moving the ball.
His counterpart, Sebastian Gleim, responded quite differently: "To win a great game for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the lucky coach.
"It felt like 10,000 people before."
On Saturday only 750 visitors were admitted to the Hohenlohe-Arena, but they came at their expense.
Not least because of BBL topscorer T.J. Shorts, who marked 22 points and directed the game of his team.
"The best gamemaker I've ever trained," added Gleim.
While in Patrick's team itself the performance carriers such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total debacle and came up to eight points after they had already settled back 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time left to hate.
Already on Wednesday (19h) the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
we used to have a different email address, but that's what I changed.
Yeah, I called in a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have been legally informed again and have written them again for this reason.
We originally reported a year and a half ago.
Sites as plucked from the egg: Max Raabe becomes 59
He was able to inspire his audience with reinterpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on his way with the program "Good day, dear luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Max Raabe actually wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But there will be nothing out of it.
The planned concert has been staged in May 2022 - "on authority" to contain the Corona virus.
Other of his appearances planned during the Advent period must first fail, as the singer’s website, which will be 59 today, and his musician (www.palast-orchester.de) says.
From January onwards, the artists want to reschedule their dates already in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in the North Rhine-Westphalian Lünen, Max Raabe has already sung a lot and liked to sing as a youth.
He studied opera singing in Berlin, and in 1986 he founded the Palace Orchestra together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established itself with its repertoire of percussionists and Chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonistists.
He was awarded prizes many times.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached the second place of the charts - just like his success album "For women this is no problem" (2013).
He made it out of the niche in the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blond hair strongly combs back and is based on labels, Max Raabe is no longer thinking away from the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Good day, dear luck" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa

Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz: No new apartment is created through expropriation
The new Federal Minister for Construction, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as requested in a referendum in Berlin.
"With expropriation, not a single new apartment is created, it only changes the ownership structure," said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the next few years.
By the way, a colorful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is the best protection against monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, the Greens and the Left wants to set up an expert commission on how to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
However, if the situation is not relaxed, Geywitz did not exclude discussions with the FDP in the traffic lights coalition about further tightening of rental rights.
The Coalitions Treaty provides for a rental brake until 2029, a limitation of rental increases in tense housing markets and the extension of the rental mirror.
I will speak to the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
Nevertheless, if the rental market is not relaxed, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps", the SPD politician stressed.

At least 100 deaths from tornados in Kentucky
With a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have moved through the United States.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 dead could be to blame.
The pictures from there remind us of a war zone.
During the night on Saturday several tornado devastations have occurred in the United States and may have claimed up to a hundred deaths.
The storms leave an approximately 320-kilometre-long snow line of desolation, especially in the state of Kentucky.
This Governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area, wherever the tornado is trapped, everything is gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial installations, roofs are in the trees.
It is difficult to imagine that this is possible at all.
He calculates alone in the state of Kentucky with up to a hundred dead people, the official figures rise hourly.
Hello, I just saw that she is sold out.
That's very bad.
Is it still produced?
Or was she completely removed from the assortment?
Is it possible to order this display in another country?
until when do you report?
If the delivery cannot be made in my apartment, I must cancel the order!
I understand that, only can I order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany that is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an article or returned it via the contact form and wanted to ask if it was arrived or processed, as I have not yet received a confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination premiums and change advertising claims
While the Federal Government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and offer their employees money premiums for vaccination.
In this way, they are on a line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The conversion of advertising slogans to vaccination calls - according to German example - is also intended to increase the willingness to use Corona vaccines.
He's changed to a company he's been reading about.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously didn't sew himself in his old place, and he was looking for something else.
You can do that, too.
And that he didn't like you at the time: no matter what.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please take the cancellation.
That will be legally relevant.
I'm doing a screen shot.

Help in the first own campaign
Boron to the pit!
I'm currently leading a group of 4 friends to the adventure About the grip pass and want to lead my heroes seamlessly into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We're playing DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual file is designed, and now I am writing the entrance adventure, and at the first encounter I stumble over my own feet.
The premise is that the heroes are to bring a carpentry with grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran lake.
The further action is to develop there.
A few miles away from the village, the hero is to hire a group of Goblins and lure them into a ambush.
I would like to give the players the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: convince, act, threaten, recognize the danger early, whatever happens to the players.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabres
In case of non-remarks, the Goblins will wait up the hero in a hollow path, flanking to each three left and right bends, arming the car’s work while two with spears stop the car’s work.
If it comes to the fight and the heroes are under, I have two solutions.
1. The heroes are all found unconscious and followed by the son of the village school, a half-elf, and healed.
The cart, of course, is gone.
2. If a defeat is inevitable, this half-eleven will enter with two of his servants and will come to the hero's aid in the struggle.
The cart's still there, everything great.
How appropriate do you deus ex machine of solution 2?
Is the encounter too much to enter the adventure?
The Goblins group will play a decisive role later on, so not only is cannon feed.
EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will guarantee many of your ideas and now have more confidence in my narrative.
I've reassembled the lamp.
And stuck together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd like to send her back anyway.
If you can send the return notes, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to the #PRS_ORG#.

I am generous of Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the season the quality on the German Sky has diminished more and more so I want to make a little air with this post.
First of all, the transfer was cancelled today in the middle of the F2 race in order to start the F1 pre-reporting on time.
Although the delayed start and start of the schedule was far behind the planning, one could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
It seems, however, that for legal reasons, the F1 enjoys priority and therefore has to restrict itself to everything else, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Nevertheless, stupid, because Sky UK has transferred the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a small praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has well accompanied the difficult situation surrounding the serious accident.
Then, in the F1, there was another rule-junction with the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both didn't know that one can change the tires under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came to the conclusion that pavements may change the tires when there were corresponding radio claims on this topic to Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators knew immediately that this possibility was possible for transit.
I believe that such elementary rules should be known simply by commenting on the F1 at a pay-TV channel.
It is also not the first puzzle rate, which is now possible or prescribed according to rules, both simply have constant uncertainties in the field of rules.
Generally, do not like the artificial comment style of Roos, but admit that the taste is the thing.
But I really like even Heiko water from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant jokes that simply leave both unprofessional, such as ordering coffee at Ralf Schumacher's (same unsuspecting) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD".
Especially the latter bring a lot of rest in the comment that he does not seem to take it seriously.
Not least, the advertising just takes over at Sky, in the lead-out Sky is the only station that goes into advertising, as one can listen to F1TV because only the German track without comment has to come out right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do.
Also, these two stations in the trainings are less advertising than Sky, and this is a free TV channel.
You have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages.
The remaining Sky Sport F1 program is also very poor and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking station that broadcasts the F1.
Unironically, RTL does a better job in the four races they are still allowed to broadcast, except for advertising.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than it would be with a reasonable transmitter.
I'd be interested in your opinion.
To the here: #PRS_ORG# pendulum lamp, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that should be delivered last week and which is still not delivered.
I've contacted the chat twice and nothing so far.
First Lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an e-mail and she never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of these has already shown a defect after a relatively short period of time (the fabric has a hole on the front part of the chair).
I'm asking for support.
Fan pumps are ideal for providing an aquarium with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via airlifters.
This series is available in 3 versions of us.
See the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the performances compared.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can run all the plants.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable for connecting several outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, depending on the fan pump model, but also offers to set an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (see us in the shop) or with a decor that transforms the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure trove, shell or similar.
The MK series has a special soundproofed construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected by means of an air hose 4/6 mm to an austrom or other...and already it can start.
The fan pump should be equal or higher than the water level and be fitted outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, you should put a return valve in between.
Simply cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent if once water runs backwards that runs the water from the basin through the pump...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, you should, like other air pumps, be covered and protected from moisture
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packs that consume little energy
Even if we specify the processing time with 3 days here in ebay, the packages are packed daily and are also picked up daily here.
If everything's going well, it's going very fast.
We just want to prevent a little so that no one is allowed to vote just because it took a little longer.
It would be like this, not everyone understands all the employees who also work in the forwarding industry...of course there is no Corona here.
Please do not judge as badly, just because the delivery is delayed, which is exclusively due to the parcel services.
Of course, you like to be mocked by these services, even if we're telling you right now... they've had a hard time.
This is also very different regionally.
Don't be an evil person, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times.
How long does it take to order the yellow with and without armrest?

Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and moderator to space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV moderator and four other passengers have made a short trip to space.
They were transported on Saturday by the Blue Origin rocket system by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos on Jeff Bezos.
The take-off and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the U.S. state of Texas.
Under radiant blue sky Bezos took the freshly decorated astronauts personally after their return to reception.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue suit when he opened the Luke to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers gradually climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they traveled ten minutes and 13 seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Nasa astronaut in 1961, flew Alan Shepard (1923-1998), named Blue Origin's rocket system, and the 50-year-old TV moderator Michael Strahan were guest guests of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
How much they paid for their ticket did Blue Origin say.
Laura Shepard Churchley remembered the mission of her father after the short flight.
He worked hard at his duties and had to do everything himself.
She just flew along like that, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed himself enthusiastically.
He would love to return to everything again, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers high
The "New Shepard" rocket system is largely automated.
The capsule separated from the rocket during the flight reached an altitude of about 100 kilometres above the Earth, temporarily with gravity before the reusable object braked off by large parachutes landed again.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts see 100 kilometres above the Earth as a frontier to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned all-out of Blue Origin: At first in July, Amazon founder Bezos was on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
At the second time in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world famous with his role as Captain Kirk in "Star Trek", was also former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and deputy director of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics suggest Bezos and Blue Origin to push forward the business with space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the good of humanity and without regard to the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and find the subject itself quite exciting and also in the laboratory do not bother me (already have the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
I have, of course, already informed myself about career prospects before my studies, but I also thought that I would like to study and become a doctorate.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially with regard to the professional prospects.
On the one hand (studycheck etc) you always hear super career opportunities and the profession is totally sought out, on the other hand you always hear of unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
That's why I would really be interested:
1) As what are you working at the moment?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/content?
3) What did you study / what training did you do?
4) Would you do it again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am currently really insecure and consider in 2022 possibly canceling my studies and doing a training as a specialist computer scientist.
If you have experience there, they also like to write :)
Extra stress before holidays & holidays weekends
This topic came to my attention last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why I'm going to have a post for that now.
Not only before big holidays, like Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our operation.
As it seems, there are those before holidays plus bridge days.
This was the case: last week was the Ascension of Mary, which is called "Ascent" in Switzerland.
On Friday, the most common people and businesses are doing a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So it was a long 4-day weekend in the house last week.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
According to e-mails that must have come out before the drive-up, order here order there, everything *unconditional* before the long weekend.
Because... why?
Because "next week" sounds after so much time and that can't be?
Or because the people seriously want to do as much in a shorter week as in a normal one?
Not only was I then stressed on Wednesday, but I was also powerfully generous.
What's this self-esteem about holidays?
What do we have holidays for if we don't like them?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all completely independent like that.
My question is simple: are we the only ones that are Swiss?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you know about this in the north?
Yvonne Caterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Caterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian hometown - but has no gifts yet.
"The beautiful thing, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, then you just go to Ilmenau to the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will vote for the feast by baking and babbling with her son.
"I love that," said Catterfeld.
However, until the mind-blowing days, she still has a few things to do: "For the first time I don't have any gifts yet, I have to start now."
NECTON-Bio supports smooth running of the mice and spring neoformation.
NECTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg of biotin/kg.
NECTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny feather.
The majority of the damage to feathers occurring in bird keeping is due solely to dietary errors.
Since the feather consists of a protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein nutrition of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of an impeccable feather dress.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Much of the loss of animals occurring during the mouse is due to lack of or imbalance in protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NECTON-Bio, the unfavourable ratio of amino acids in most vegetable feed is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No other vitamin preparation should be administered during the use of NECTON-Bio.
NECTON-Bio is cold water soluble and can easily be administered via drinking water or soft feed.
Thank you. I found it.
Unfortunately, still not working
DDR-Handwerksmodell Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the lok was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare lok probably stems from the conversion proposal of model railway ME issue 11/1968, used with track tracks and faults see photos, function good, the E 95 series is a heavy freight train electric locomotive of the German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which has been designed for the traction of heavy coal gas trains in the Silesian network, thus the construction kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we are able to operate
In 1924 the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had commissioned the AEG to present proposals for an electric locomotive that could transport 2,200 tonne coal trains and 530 tonne passenger trains at 45 km/h.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926 the DRG decided on the delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with the Tatter bearing drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens boot mills with the electric part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered to E 95 01-06.
They all survived World War II and then returned to the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946 the locomotives arrived as a repair property in the Soviet Union.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
The Reichsbahnenfortungswerk Dessau has identified the upgrading of all six locomotives.
[4] The three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were recombined in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as replacement parts.
The E 04, E 44 and E 94, which are available in larger quantities, were first chosen.
Only when the E 94 was clear that it could not be further increased, the E 95 was in the focus of the review.
[4]The locomotives were first stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway station.
They arrived at Halle P railway station in 1960.
They were mostly used in a separate orbital plan before coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, complex control of locomotives proved problematic.
So it was more often that shooters remained stuck in shifts.
Then the man with hammer and wood wedge on this locomotive had to release the shooter again during the ride.
Damage to the motors often occurred and led to months of failure at the locomotive.
[5] Since there were enough new construction locomotives at the end of the 1960s and no significant expansion of the electric plant was planned at that time, the Reichsbahn was able to dispense with old locomotives and most split engines, so that the E 95 was out of service.
In addition, they found that the Deutsche Reichsbahn only wanted to occupy electric locomotives, which, due to the mentioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility of the cab, would have caused a problem in the train operation.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were dismissed in mid 1969, they followed the E 95 01, which was replaced by the E 95 01 on 5 October 1970.
The planned new name 255 001 has therefore never been used.
All locomotives were split up to the E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a fixed heating system at Halle Central Station.
It took some time for the responsible people at the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 was worth receiving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initial exterior design of the locomotive began with the aim of being able to present it to a vehicle show in the RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has been part of the Dresden Transport Museum as an inoperative museum locomotive.
The internal completion of the locomotive took place in 1986.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale), the locomotive museum is managed.
Since 1995 employees of the traditional Bw Halle P community have been working on the operational design of the locomotives.
In April 2015, for the first time, the locomotives were presented for an exhibition in the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new internal and external painting, whereby the transformers were checked and five driving engines were able to operate.
-The locomotives were in operation on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branching side tracks until 1945, where they proved themselves on the basis of their reliable drive and the low maintenance effort.
In February 1945 the machines were relocated to Leipzig to the central German network.
The main area of use was Silesia
Handicraft model H0 in OVP, function well, it is necessary to rework optically on the locomotive in self-work, dusted, with game tracks, cellar smell !!!!, very rare handicraft model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may have labels and bearing traces.
Yes the F-parts are it
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with a part.
The middle beam is held by two feet.. unfortunately these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't build the bed.
The central beam is held by two feet, these are unfortunately incorrectly produced.
The centre beam does not fit into the intended position.
So I'm getting a new one.
When will they be released?
No flattening.
These are, according to the assembly instructions the right ones of the shape, they were just too narrow
But it doesn't matter.
Main cause they fulfill their purpose
They're not flat with me.
Could I have this sent?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
Home fire with two lightly injured and high damage
Two people were easily injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, there has been an estimated damage in the six-digit euro area, as reported by the police on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent house in Kinsau (Landkreis Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were reportedly brought to the hospital on Sunday with slight smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not assume intentional fire.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck took over the investigation.
It'll arrive much later.
And I have to pay shipping costs again.
To uncover Fake-News - Biontech CEO publishes vaccine photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" at the beginning of 2021
Biontech Chief Uğur Şahin had not yet made a public statement to his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend moved him, told Şahin.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainzer company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing how he receives a vaccination against the Coronavirus.
In the social media, there was false information that I was allegedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," wrote Şahin on Friday in a post in the network "LinkedIn".
"For a few months, friends have urged me to post a photo of me on which I am being vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far, he has rejected this because communication should not revolve around him.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened when I learned that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He fights a severe covid-19 disease and has been hanging on a breathing device for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin continued to write.
He didn't ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause, however, seems to be fear, which is often frowned upon by misinformation and mistrust".
Fear is hard to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
On the Internet, an interview is circulated with the German wave, in which Uğur Şahin says he was not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020 as well as the Deutsche Welle itself made clear.
"I am not legally allowed to get the vaccine myself," said Şahin at the time.
There is a prioritisation in Germany in terms of vaccination.
In the meantime, prioritisation has been lifted for a long time - and the Biontech boss has been able to collect the data three times in a row.
Fire in transformers: Tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia the light went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases probably no heating either.
A fire had paralysed a transfer station.
After a fire with serious damage in a transfer station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia have had to escape without electricity for around 24 hours.
Due to the fire, the lights went out on Friday evening with 41,000 affected residents in several municipalities.
The West Netz reported that on Saturday many emergency power units had been in operation until the large-area fault could finally be completely fixed on the late evening.
Firefighters and THW helpers provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered care places in schools and called for neighbourhood assistance.
The caregiver thanked the people concerned for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also thank the municipalities concerned, the circle, the fire brigade and the THW for their tireless use," said Florian Witt, head of the area of primary technology, in a communication on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will continue for a few days, as the Westnet Monteurs were able to start up some lines only on a provisional basis, he explained.
According to company information, a technical defect led to the fire.
Power flows again
According to Westnet's report, the fire that started on Friday at around 7.15 p.m. has seriously damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switching plant in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid.
There is a need for elaborate cleaning and repair work.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level had been established.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday at 6 p.m., over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
A further 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid had been added gradually from 9:30 p.m.
Since 11:15 p.m. the last ones still affected by the failure also had electricity.
More than 80 Western network and partner companies were in use.
After the construction of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities also called for neighbourhood assistance.
"It is important now that the citizens take care of elderly or single people in their neighbourhood and inform local firearm homes when help is needed," said Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
During the installation and operation of emergency power units, the inhabitants of Altenheimen were in particular in focus.
Moreover, according to government data, temporary places of care were provided in schools for those people who could not provide themselves or who needed power-dependent medical devices or who depended on medical care.
Hello!
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them with you and pay them in euros?
This is the day cover #PRS_ORG# in blue green.
I hope you also have a nice day and please stay healthy.
But I can't put that underframe on the tabletop.
This is Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of this.
We wanted those with table plates diameter of #NUMBER#
we have got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't push them into each other and therefore shorten them.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise, I would have to send it back because otherwise it is not suitable for the purpose.
I'd be happy to have a feedback.
That's really easier!
That's how we do it!
Send me the return note by e-mail?
the repair is complete now.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Do you want me to do this now?
I find such a low credit card almost inexcusable.
We do not agree with this.
Nordic combination: combined Riiber wins
The German Nordic combiners Fabian Rißle and Julian Schmid have been printed on the podium at the World Cup in the Estonian Otepää.
The duo once again had to be sued by the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started skiing in the track with great anticipation after the ski jump.
Return of order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be returned to my account?
Yes, we both did and use the version 4.5...
could be that they have heard of problems more often
I bought a book directly with my #PRS_ORG#, it also seems to be on it.
Sobal I want to open it comes the message, ups!
This document could not be opened.
File is possibly malformed you will log into the customer service.
As far as I can see it it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can they help me?
Chat connection's gone and now?
I have to work in between!
To make the paint order even and clean, clean the components with some soapy water of dust, fat and fingerprints, rinse and dry with clear water.
Before you bring the brush the first time with a new color to the model, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 lines.
You can do this on the later invisible inside of the components or on a yoghurt cup.
The first bar on the component
Draw the brush evenly stroke next to stroke.
Light overlap of the layers of colour later ensures a smooth surface.
Avoid quickly wiping with the brush.
This creates unrealistic surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones could come out later.
Metal tones and metallic colors come to an end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can become unbeautiful metal scaffolding when mixed with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for one day before you build them.
The original look reaches the models through the Decals or subtraction images.
From space signs to aircraft, boat names, as well as drawing patterns and markings for car models: The Decals give the model the last cut.
Apply the decals in the correct order as long as the components are still well reachable.
An aircraft cockpit can be easily or easily attached before it is installed in the hull.
Even more important than the right tool such as scissors, pinzette and toothpicks are when clinging time, patience and a quiet hand.
Cut each required decal individually and lay it down for you.
Decals are also called water slides because you wetten their back with water briefly until the carrier paper becomes dark through the wets.
Then you slide the picture only a small piece of paper and place the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you have moistened before).
While holding the Decal on the model with a tool, pull the carrier paper off the side.
Attention: Always check whether the picture is right before you slide it completely out of the paper so that it doesn't stick, crack or even tear.
Sew excess water with a household cloth.
Respect not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book briefly as soon as I look for something else then I don't read the book anymore and I have to log out and log in and reload the book and look for the place where I read it.
AM Saturday I've already communicated with you.
Do I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp arrived with me in 3 individual packages
Thanks a lot anyway!
I'll buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
But do I get this back easily?
Child Wish Treatment at PKV / What is a "insurance case"?
Hello together,
we have been in child wish treatment for some time, now that it is about billing with the PKV, it suddenly stands across.
The order after:
We had requested the children's wish in advance at the PKV and got the promise over 3 attempts.
The tests were in no way restricted (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and birth and was calculated with the PKV.
Some time later we tried to have a second child, and conducted 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but they did not yet calculate with the PKV.
We applied again for the cost assumption of the PPS and again received 3 further trials.
After some further attempts (we have carried out more attempts than promised, logically calculate the most expensive with the PPS) we entered the invoices at the PPS and got the bad surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the PPS wants to refund only 3 attempts.
The reason: With pregnancy/birth, the remaining two attempts of the first commitment lapse.
The second child wish was a new insurance case.
According to GTC, however, "The insurance case starts with the treatment, it ends if the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here to refund the PKV (only 3 attempts will be made) or we (there are 5 attempts to refund)?
* Would the PKV have had to point out in the assurances that with a birth the further attempts fall?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (due to closed egg yolks) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts would give your opinion here.
Thank you for your help!
Can you send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can best reach them again?
All right.
We're not gonna order anything from them anymore.
If they add the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they have obviously lost good customer.
They can pass this on to their managers.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday the colleague told me that the refund was made and now tell me that I have to send back the thing.
I can't help but think that the dresser's going to be completely disturbed by me.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
It is clear that the refund has been triggered and I have still not received a refund via #PRS_ORG#
They can instruct their manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We're not going to do that anymore.
No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they can't sell him as an office chair.
Regardless, the 24 month warranty applies.
No, it's not possible for me to get another kind of packaging.
I will be able to dismantle the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products will be applied with additional stools to be purchased, but unfortunately we cannot find them with you.
Can they help?
Topic of the week: The best low budget movies
What is exactly a low-budget film, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
In the web you can find plenty of lists of low-budget movies, such as for example on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What's wrong with you?
And what do you think you don't like at all?
Is a very good customer of you, has already furnished 2 apartments complete with your furniture.
Wanted the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended once again, is it also reliable now?
Thank you very much.
With friendly greetings
If there's no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30min, there's no chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position... I'll give up soon because it just doesn't work here.
Hello.
Half victory against Belarus at high costs for the EU
In conflict with the Belarusian regime, the EU can announce a "half victory" to the political expert Raphael Bosong.
The costs were very high, however, and resulted in massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees to Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, Bosong said the Evangelical Press Office (epd).
Sustainablely, the EU has not solved the confrontation, said the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP).
This state of silence - Belarus is not very small, but the EU feels like a winner - is probably going on for a while.
Dealing with people at the border was not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong ruled.
Obviously, there is an "increasing normalisation of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole is not determined to oppose it, it is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This trend also weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It seems that it cannot go through when a Member State heads up to do its thing," as is currently the case in Poland, which did not even allow Frontex the EU Border Protection Agency to have access to the border.
In addition, the EU paid a further prize for its policy at the border with Belarus, says Bosong: A basic agreement on asylum policy was made difficult as the line "Border Protection, Border Protection and Border Protection" had been strengthened.
Re-examined cross-border attempt
According to Poland's border guards, migrants have again tried to cross Belarus on Polish territory.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday at night and returned to the border, said a spokesman of the authority on Sunday.
The Polish officials had been stoned in the incident near the village of Czeremsza by the migrants.
According to the information, a soldier was struck in the face and had to be medically cared for by a military doctor.
A total of 52 border crossings were registered within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months or tried to do so.
The EU calls on Alexander Lukashenko to have attracted her as a head of power in Minsk with the prospect of entry into the EU.
According to the press reports, Poland and Lithuania closed border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines bringing migrants and refugees to the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners traveled to people's countries of origin to prevent departure there.
The most effective element of the EU response was the pressure on the airlines," said Bosong.
"There the EU has thrown its market power into the scales and demonstrated its determination to operate with tough ban days and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk also had to take account of domestic policy costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not concerned that the security apparatus regularly drags thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after a controversial Formula 1 finale
In the opinion of Mercedes, Max Verstappen should have committed two regulatory breaches during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After Abu Dhabi's controversial Formula 1 finale, Mercedes filed an opposition.
The silver darts suspect two rule breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to a alleged violation of Max's actions in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase when he was supposed to have taken over regularly.
A second objection was filed against the valuation at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes-View, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
On the last lap of Lewis Hamilton in Mercedes, Verstappen had still overtaken him and was hit for his first Formula One title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety-car-phase in which the Dutch had overtaken driving cars in front of him.
I'll check it out.
I'll talk to the bank and report back to you.
Thank you for the support

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
During the reading series "LiteraTour Nord", author Judith Hermann read the sold-out blue note from her current novel "Daheim" on Friday and also acted as a moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the nocturnal sounds on her doorstep.
I left the contact form yesterday to return an article, but I received no e-mail confirmation or similar.
My question would be whether my question has been answered.
It does not have everyone the time for your clumsy chat and incorrectly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake, which you fix and not all of our household.
Contact Mrs. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day
We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# will receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a new order of the #PRS_ORG# bedside table and a return ticket.

I'm sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semit means nothing.
It's like a granddaughter says he has nothing against foreigners.
Both of them will not admit their i.
But Colleagues constantly reproduces any anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself then you should simply leave it complete.
Yeah, well, then you're as little serious as Colleagues.
Anyone who seriously questions evolution is simply completely lost.
For my part, a God has started this whole thing.
But as soon as you're creative, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and science is just crazy.
And that's how you're an enemy of science and not taking seriously more like Colleagues.
In order to obtain an optimal field of vision, the lens should be closer to the eye as close as possible.
The specially designed aplanatically-chromatic lens system allows you to use the lens up to the edge zone in a practical way and without color defects.
Lupen is often marked with magnification indications.
However, this information is only valid for precisely defined conditions that rarely meet the conditions of use.
In order to be able to use your magnifying glass optimally, we ask you to take note of the information in the "Technical Data" table (see instructions for use in the packaging).
Light reflexes arise on the lens surfaces of all optical devices - even in the case of impact flaps.
These reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflection coating.
If the optimal conditions of use are observed - a lens close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.

Dental sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz women look for Christmas trees from
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced some kuriosis situations when selling teeth.
One day a man should have driven home again without his partner, because both of them could not agree.
Every year he plants well 2000 pieces for that.
The 56-year-old has already experienced some kuriosis situations.
He says that always makes the pre-Christmas season a little fun.
What about the voucher?
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I have received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will assess it accordingly.
We do not need to discuss the better court here, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a spinning spear.
So both have their names.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher", which doesn't sound so delicious at all.
Problems with glass fibre + Devolo DLan/Magic
We've had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I have problems building a stable Wi-Fi network now.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent 50 Mbit until a few failures.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and to the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, it also arrives.
However, the other DLan module, which sends the Wifi, no longer reaches the full 500, but the further I get in the house with the module, the less arrives (so use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. Rooms located from the other module).
This means that the Internet with the new fiber optic connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but also here there were similar large losses.
Could someone explain to me why with fiber optics so much Internet speed over the power line goes "lost"?
And is LAN really the solution?
It would be extremely expensive to still move into the house LAN cable.
I'm really desperate, which is why I have created an account here.
That is why I would be all the more pleased about an answer.
When it's time to change the current account
Who would have thought that now would be peace with the giroconts?
While many banks have used the fall to confirm with all kinds of tricks from their customers the increases in fees of the past, the amount of the tax is further reduced.
For example, the Deutsche Bank was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros for a long time.
Now it has just halved the allowance and even quadrupled for daily money.
In a first step, the limit was reduced only for customers of the Group's Postbank division - to 50,000 euros for Giro and investment accounts and to 25 000 euros for daily cash accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as confirmed by a spokesman on request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which is still valid, as was the ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the amount of free money in two stages, initially to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, more than 100 banks now have an exemption of 25,000 euros or less, according to the Verivox website.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at EUR 25,000: however, there is still a legal dispute with the Consumer Centres, which in the first instance before the Landgericht Berlin even got right to this regulation.
It is now being discussed in the banks whether the institutions should possibly make provisions - in the case that the upper institutions too explain the negative interest rates in principle and many millions must be repaid to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty army
She's now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But your life is like a mountain and valley ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was elected the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For them, who in 2021 made terror with the "Friends" reunition and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of much discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers takes care of their appearance.
After all, says Aniston, she treats herself to a chip on the day (yes, read correctly: a SINGLE chip from the bag).
The fact that you are still flying to the hearts of the female and male fans is a miracle.
Maybe because she's just bad luck -- and she's still looking for great love.
And removed the baby wish from the list.
Previously, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked this have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really intimidating.
Keep hoping that success and fame will also make you happy.
Unworthy end of a career: Räikkönen must give up
Kimi Räikkönen's departure from Formula 1 was even quieter than thought.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn pulled out the gloves and washed the sweat from the forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight belt contact, Räikkönen had to drop his Alfa Romeo after not even half the race distance at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ending his career in the motorsport king class.
His wife, Minttu, and the two children, were also taken to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's biggest success was the winning of the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He made 21 Grand Prix win, started 18 times from the pole and came 103 times to the podium. dpa
Friedrich gets 60th World Cup Victory - Nolte wins in the two-bob - Sport
The mark of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the target of the bob pilot.
"I figured it out once, I would have to win nine and a half per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion of the BSC Oberbärenburg, who booked two successes in two days at the Winterberg races.
First, on Saturday he turned off the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths, in which he drove from rank three to one.
Then he changed somewhat to the material setting and made a bigger head start on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he made his debut in front of the British Brad Hall.
==References====External links==
"We were more at risk today and rewarded," said Friedrich, who also entered his 22nd victory in series.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, driving for Stuttgart, came to second place this time in fifth place.
Christoph Hafer of the BC Bad Feilnbach landed on the 8th place after fourth place in the first race.
"If I knew what else he'd do, I'd do it like that," said Lochner.
Nolte with home win - podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte won the third season with the women on her way home.
After reaching the fourth place in the Monobob on the day before, she raced for the World Cup on Sunday at the German triple success with Shieber Deborah Levi.
Two-bob Olympic Champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia came second with Germany's fastest Sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she booked the first podium in this winter.
The Wiesbaden woman Kim Kalicki landed in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was super cool, first podium in the world cup, I'm superhappy that Mariama takes me along.
I'm super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the starting times were okay today," said Burghardt, stressing, "it's not just moving, but there's a lot to do around."
Jamanka was a little annoyed by the not quite error-free rides, but said, "It goes in the right direction".
I already had the blanket in the shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What do you want me to do?
I have not just received it and therefore cannot redeem it, which is why I have at last asked for it.
Through Corona last year, I had quite different problems and never had time for them.
And now his name was run away, which made me very angry.
Look in the chat it was about the Asare seat.
I would like to return it and then order again, as it is just reduced :)
Why is shipping only started on 16.3.
There was nothing of such long delivery time on your website
No only when I tip on it comes an extra field with the message
Was taken from your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the wrong goods.
But we want the shelf module anyway, just a new undamaged
And don't cancel the whole order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello love great girls and girls and women,
I've got some things I just want to write and maybe it's one - or others like that...
I'm 24, have kPTBS, full-time student and dog emama - apart from my dog not screaming or going to kindergarten, he's actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is ill, has recovered a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also think I have emotional needs and because I want to see him and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was beautiful.
I helped him to take a shower (because the hand is in the dressing room burning).
He is cooled up above and we are currently seeing him less (1-2x week) which makes me very happy with my needs for affection and love.
My dog's kid just had a stomachache, I cooked for him and now he's in his pillow lid and he's relaxed a little after I was there with the heat lamp and caressing for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just gone for a month.
Now we also have housework on us, which we of course divide ourselves.
But cooking itself is just a lot of work for me...
My PTBS disease is very well adjusted, I am halfway well treated and ready to come.
Not good, but I'll get right and I'm almost symptom-free.
My university just requires a lot (for me), tomorrow at 15 o'clock I have a written test for which I have not done anything yet and the day after morning anatomy hour for which I should at least prepare a little something.
And next week I have an oral exam right on Tuesday, and what comes then is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no place anymore.
So this is how my week goes: Only until the day after tomorrow, then the weekend.
But after that, the whole thing goes on?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the holiday begins.
Just until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed that I need these spiritual clues, because otherwise I'll take this down.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic," but otherwise I can't...
Is that how you do it?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful I don't have to work.
I can't put that in words.
Don't know if I would have survived my kptbs otherwise.
I think this also has some to do with mental load of women, and that's why I thought I'd find a pity here...
I certainly wish you a restful evening, the week is almost over!
I got my order today unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and the table leg has print.
At the first delivery, the colour was exactly the same as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now, will I get a different color or how?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
Two times, by the way.
But she was not confirmed.
Once something completely different: I found in school at the time that many religious teachers do not believe in God and it is just another subject for them like math or geography.
For me, it was always something strange, perhaps because I was raised Christian, and I always believed in it somehow.
How are you doing?
You may also be able to tell about work and/or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But just thought it was strange to have a physics teacher who did not believe in the theory of relativity.
What, then, will help you to want to teach religion if you do not believe it?
Keeping Culture or Something?
Hope you have a question isn't too private.
Can't or can't it be changed?Please write that in English I understand well too
It's been a long time, then I'd miss it.
It's okay, thanks.
I expect a response in time by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Please try to find help with the video
Hello dear people,
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (in 24).
I think it's been a movie for young people.
In the film there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
First of all, modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the kingdom of the dead)(not entirely certain).
Since I can't describe it any more in the real world, there's a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (Uniform similar to those of the soldiers out of the curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and an act is created.
The Antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm in order to live for himself I mean.
I believe the transition is also the burial site of the soldier.
In the end, I believe both soldiers fight each other.
If that's what I'm saying to you, I'm grateful for every answer.
Our little one slept on his belly from week one.
Fast forward: still lives :D
Relax.
Such a child does much more than you think.
Make sure everything is right around here, no cucumbers, more often go in and watch, but no minutes of surveillance.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Ah, and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but we've always had a blanket.
Watch your child when he's asleep.
Is it turning the head aside?
Can it rise from the abdomen?
Or is it in front of the face directly in the mattress?
You can deduce if everything's all right.
We've all grown up and when my husband came to the world, it was a walk and wish to put the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
We are also already "stammkunde" with you and have bought a lot of products
But why do you only offer me 20 euro?
Hello, I wrote a letter yesterday with a colleague of yours and so far I have not received any feedback.
It is about my wardrobe that arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer doesn't fit into the closet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is currently not to be used.
To make it clear.
RBTV promised me a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It is simply that the policy of this station is now under control.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then at the same time go on a big bedding tour.
It was said that you are an "independent" Internet transmitter.
Quoting Arno: You don't want to be "a running little column".
What is it?
A 0815 advertiser trying to bring his BilloMerch to the Elitefan.
And then we still have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Of course, they apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
They may, of course, continue to insult people.
A Krogmann who is completely lacking in empathy and at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms tries to make ashes.
How are you supposed to find it all right?
Great if you like it, I think it's terrible.
I ask for Rueckrueck, as my supplied wooden table was defective.

Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer loaded through my power supply.
I bought this again about 5 months ago, so I should still work.
I thought the power supply on its own was enough to operate.
Incorrect display, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer runs despite the power supply inserted.
I've expanded the battery, but there's nothing going on here.
Do you want ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in network operation?
Is there something else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But don't know how high the seating area is....
Often on tour and still a lot of equipment?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack by Peak Design!
20 liter capacity also swallow larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be safely stored using the padded FlexFold parts.
And whatever else you need on everyday items remains well organized thanks to practical access to individually configurable interiors and removable from photo equipment.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2) the series is presented in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design has literally in itself - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing quick access to the photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two possibilities: once conventionally via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch locking system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven itself with the Messenger Bags.
There is a metal clasp with matching anchor beams on the front of the backpack in the clasp.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has devised various "fill levels": there are 4 anchor beams, stablely destroyed, into which the closing hook can be cut.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you simply take the top bar, it is rather empty, a deeper one.
Valves and hooks are also magnetic.
Thus, the backpack can also be reliably closed without touching the hook.
The second option also distinguishes the Everyday backpack from other photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from above - you don't have to worry about the content anymore!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the everyday fitness of the backpack: because if you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage with you.
In Everyday Backpack, you can individually configure the interior (more below) and thus easily store both of them separately - and access them independently through the two side openings.
So you can also pull the backpack from the right in front of the body, for example, to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday things stay safe in the left backpack half and do not come in between.
Comfortable, uncomplicated adjustable wear belts help.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the content remains dry even if it is to go to Scotland in autumn.
Unfortunately, I waited in vain for the email of their support.
#NAME# yesterday gave me an email from confirmation for the assignment of
Contact on the side of the freight forwarder announced to pick up the incorrectly delivered table.
So far, I haven't received a message.
I'm asking for immediate processing.
I am already writing with the third support employee, with no one I came further than to the promise that I will receive an email as confirmation.
This is the return of the incorrectly delivered custom #NAME#
So it's time for the cabinet to be delivered again?
Keeping him like this is not an option for me...
It's working.
Many thanks for the help
Wish you a nice evening
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When is the item delivered?
Order and payment was made on 12.1.21.
A completely different lamp has been delivered to me than I ordered
Please call me.
If you extend the voucher, I will give you a larger order, but at least I have kept the damaged piece of furniture and not sent back.
And I couldn't imagine that the last year passed differently than I thought, and I just couldn't redeem and clarify it in a timely manner.
But I do not accept the damage as a customer.
Rotary brake discs are designed to appreciate the requirements of the dynamic driver, the reliability and safety of braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotary brake discs are made of cast iron and then machined (drilled and cut).
All tinted discs are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are specific for certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production programme will be drawn up, which will be based on the characteristics of the original assembly with the balancing of the disc.
The tinted discs thus produced ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
In addition, openings created increase the efficiency of the cooling of the disc, while cuttings improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake valves.
Aesthetic properties of our tinted discs underline the character of each car by their attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city in which an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing cracks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" by "49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the rapidly growing and thriving cities of the country.
Areas were set up, tents opened, and Saloons and hotels were created almost overnight.
Everyone wanted his share of the country's wealth.
For many people it was called: "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankrott)!
In this game you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You'll be looking for gold, recruiting workers, driving horses together and building businesses.
You will also be given the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You're gonna have to outsmart your pioneer colleagues not to go out with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
You choose simultaneously your actions, have to build budgets with your resources and a Tableau, which more and more "works" for you (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your Tableau allow you to become more efficient, to receive additional actions or to apply rules to your favor.
With these buildings and dynamic bridge plates, you can develop your individual playing style with the help of fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which the gold was discovered in Coloma), over 1849 (the year of California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year in which California gained the official statehood).
One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will be secretly and at the same time select a location on the schedule where they can perform actions.
Afterwards, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a location has most pioneers, he gets a lock!
This disables half of the location - which reduces the possible actions there.
Then the players perform alternate actions, such as winning resources, moving cars, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops and positioning revolvers.
When all the actions are completed, the pioneers return.
At the beginning of each round, the laureate turns to a new location and thus changes the actions available.
This continues until the winner has moved five times, covering each location once and ending the year.
There is a shooting in which players have to defend Coloma from an attack of angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough guns and the bandits are superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive less rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final score takes place.
The player with most victory points wins!
In the case of free delivery, I take up to the dimensions 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm the shipping method, goods delivery (filled in games).

"Why Children Are Not Tyrants" Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I immediately looked at it.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a popular guest in talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrannen" (2008), he triggered a heated educational debate.
The former patient:those entitled to education are now making serious accusations against him.
Please be careful, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Our parents and other responsible ones must never, never, never, go about power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child room for his development and to make the framework as big for the child as it makes sense and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries advise on the loss of the test obligation for triple vaccination
At their next meeting, the health ministers of the countries want to decide on a federal departure from the testing obligation for triple vaccinations.
"We countries need clarity quickly, whether and from when the test requirement can be waived for three vaccinations," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), Chairman of the Health Minister's Conference, "Picture on Sunday".
The drop of 2G plus for triple vaccines was "not only medically meaningful, but also provides an additional impancent," said Holetschek.
Federal Minister for Health Karl Lauterbach (SPD) said "that he will make a proposal for this at the Health Minister's Conference on Tuesday."
So I want to send the lamp back.
How do I best do that?

What you describe is called *Awareness*, i.e. sensory perceptions under full anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of approximately 1 to 1000.
The most common is the hearing of sounds/vomits, rarer to the viewing of images and the rarest to see pain.
For this topic: Cesarean cuts are associated with surgery at an increased rate of awareness, as a very deep anesthesia is avoided for the protection of the child until the abduction.
Previous Awareness episodes should be mentioned during anaesthetic discussions.
Certain anaesthetic procedures such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Love everyone, this comment describes by me although Awareness correctly, but had no** u/Nitemarex **by definition.
Have read her comment incorrectly.
But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ won't help us either.
These are statutory warranty requirements.
The absolute minimum would be that they take back the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check again if you are going to take back at least the defective chair.
Then we sell the second chair privately.
That's where we lose a lot of money.
I already sent you an e-mail that you did not respond to.
The question again.
In the order and on the invoice is that the goods are delivered up to a room of my choice.
The freight forwarder is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
They told me that they only deliver on the doorstep - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order because I don't know any person who can carry me the heavy furniture on the first floor.
I'm not gonna call you?
I had a question formulated
Theatre historian Günther Rühle 97-year-old died
He has been a theatre critic and an executive.
Later he wrote a monumental theatre story.
On Friday Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There's still the new book on the table, freshly pressurised: "An old man is getting older".
The shocking diarium of a slow farewell from the world, which the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle led until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I testify my life's thanks here already."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are European, standardized wooden pallets, which are used mainly as loading carriers in the European area.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to statistics from Austria in 2020, more than ten million pallets were produced in Austria.
The production value was well 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported annually to Austria is not collected
New York Gets the First MLS Championship
New York City FC won the title in the Major League Soccer for the first time.
After 1:1 in the regular playing time against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference decided to finale in the 11 meter shooting with 4:2.
In the finals of the Eastern Conference, New York went against Philadelphia Union, the team of the German Kai Wagner.
Rouden Tips & Tricks
I had got a lot of great tips here a week ago for the perfect goulasch.
That was at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thank you again for that :)
Now I have come to the tastes and want to cook at New Year's Eve for the first time.
Tomorrow I'll set up a cattle fund for that.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I have no oven, but only a large pot.
How's it going now?
What about the books or how do I get them back to my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn't that good anymore, but I get it.
It is a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by e-mail of the refund on 18.01.
But until today, the money has not been received from me.
Please check it out.
Where there are still Christmas Bread in the Lübeck room
For many people, Gans or Ente is one of the Christmas days like the fir tree and the gifts.
You didn't get any poultry yet?
Time's running out.
We'll tell you where you can get a Christmas bread in Lübeck's room.
The "Drive" of a tube end stage contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuitry.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controller, you can set the desired level on the one hand and the disintegration of your sounds on the other.
In addition, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller that can be used to reduce the sound level without changing anything on the "Gain" and the distortion.
On top of that, it already came to the conclusion that with the POWER LEVEL regulator, a power reserve can even be flown when it goes loudly unmistakably.
POWER LEVEL regulators make use of the full potential of the VT+ series in every situation.
The earbud can also be used as a line output.
This signal is processed with a box simulation, so that you get an extraordinary "acoustic" sound impression yourself when using a headphones or direct shots.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX book, allowing you to jam into your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you also donate a VFS5 foot key, the sounds can also be easily accessed by foot, the effect blocks on/off and the pace of the compatible effects that follow.
This is actually indispensable for the live use.
With its new power packages, VOX will take another step forward!
But had seen it with others.
Is there any way you can send the lamp back?
Because it's too low over a dining table?
So I'd like to send her back.
Can you help me with that?
And the dresser?
In the next few weeks, will we receive another update to the exact delivery date?
Hello, they've been sitting on the #PRS_ORG# chairs.
If it doesn't work, I'd be happy with a discount or a voucher.
I may find a customer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods that I do not need are a lot.
I have just received my delivery and would have liked to know whether screws were intended as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the intended hooks.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been worth it
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreements
The negotiations on the resumption of the international nuclear agreement are progressing according to Iranian data.
"Both sides are short ahead of discussing the issues on the agenda," said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday of the news agency Irna.
This was a "positive and important development" because initially there had not even been any agreement on the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on the relaunch of the agreement had continued after just one week of interruption.
Negotiators of Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France and Russia participate in the negotiations.
A U.S. delegation is also present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now state state state with highest Corona incidence
Thüringen has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
As the only federal state, the value is above the 1000 mark.
As the only state in Thuringia, Thuringia was located at the Corona-Incidence on Sunday above the 1000 brand.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had last always shown the highest incidence in Germany, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday the incidence in Thuringia had fallen slightly, but it had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 other deaths related to infection were reported within one day of 2242.
200 severe to Covid-19 Sick people were treated intensively on Sunday in hospitals.
Reporting delays may occur on weekends.
In addition, the health services have been overburdened for weeks and hardly come after with the recording of new cases.
I understand that.
As the delivery takes place only at the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print this out and stick on the package and drop it at the post office, that was?
I don't need to click/clarify/fill anything further?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, that's why I'm writing to you.
I would like to take over the return at my own expense.
8 euro Return fee is a trifle in my eyes.
It is time for changes
###Starting day, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary room in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#What's the mail for?
If you look at the activity in the past months of MBundestag, you can see one thing: it is not extensive.
We came into a winter star and expanded the summer hole to a few months.
What's the problem?
Yeah, what's it all about?
For the most part, this should simply be related to the dissatisfaction, as some things have passed here and as we generally stand.
In the last few days, the impression has been that many here really still have Bock on the MBundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community is asked about the MBundestag, which wants to keep them alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in the last few days and has found a, to put it simply, a cluster of shards.
After some writing and writing down several people from the community have found themselves who have the desire to rebuild the project.
However, I would like once again to urge everyone to participate, only in this way can this project continue to exist in the future.
To this end, we have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server, on which we can exchange and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How should the MBundestag work in the future?
* What existing orders must be modified / adapted / removed?
* How should we act to the outside in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I forgot something, but what's not bad is what we have the discord at the end.
If you want and have time, come to the dispute, work with us and let us democratically decide on the future.
I ordered a lampshade from you that it will still be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/clobish for it and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered a different suspension from you.
I put it together and noticed this then when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about that.
I hope this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: the day cover #PRS_ORG#, are there also in excess, i.e. in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet is picked up in time.
And I'm asking you to let that happen now.
I don't have a suitable packaging, but will remove the cabinet as far as possible for the collection - they have to clear with #PRS_ORG# as it can then work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there a manual for installation?
How long do I have to get it or decide to return it?
How do you answer the question, why are you vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself has lived vegetarian for a while, now it is very rare to eat meat.
I myself was also a few years ago vegetarian.
To the question of whether I have always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
And while I thought for a long time that as a vegetarian, I would support animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that in the end I also support animal torture.
Therefore my decision to become vegan.
At the moment, I had the impression that misbehavior came up on her side, she then defended the vegetarianism and thought she knew where her meat came from and reduced as a vegetarian animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was to "plump"?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that as a vegan one is quickly put into a corner and conflicts arise without which one would put it on.
It greets a harmonious veganer (;
This is clearly not an exception under § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# do not disconnect from the legal requirements for distance marketing.
I am at the assigned date on which #PRS_ORG# my return does not pick up locally.
Since I can't be there because of a funeral, it can't be changed either.
Can I be assigned an alternative pick-up date, please?
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I will be here again and again.
Lahnsteiner Wehr for water rescue equipped: 45,000 Euro grant from the country
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Leventz in the Lahnsteiner Town Hall handed over a grant of 45,000 euros for the new equipment car Water rescue of the volunteer fire brigade Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle in use since November 2020 was EUR 135,000.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the State of Rhineland-Palatinate supports us in this," says Lahnstein's Mayor Peter Labonte.
The machine car is used by the divers' fork Lahnstein, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Over and under water they perform tasks in water and ice recovery as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, the boom of the hotel shipping on Rhine and Mosel as well as the continued use of the Lahn as a leisure flow contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations however have synced, removed, and the app newly loaded NOT worked.
I am somewhat frustrated because the whole action has cost me a lot of time and is hoping for help now.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# to June.
Can I enter an appointment during the order process?

Thank you for putting yourself here for the whole thing, I have also spent almost a decade in state service in a similar activity, we were also weapons carriers in the executive, and I don't want to go further on that!
I always find the question of right and left to be very simple.
In principle, however, one should say that, of course, the state servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum rather than from the revolutionary left, that should be clear to everyone.
That, of course, also in the special uniform and arms bearer people to the right of conservative magic should also be clear to everyone that these people can then of course deal with the reality of life is also clear, because you have, of course, besides the average white man, now many Germans with migrant backgrounds, women and also homosexuals (and I do not mean the exaggerated feminine clichés now, because these are in the executive rather less than at all but quite normal men and women to whom you do not notice if they don't tell you) and also to these people and I have to leave, because in doubt they will save your life or put it in for you.
However, even if my experience sounds funny for the first time after a conservative attitude, they are proud of Germany and feel less pick-up through exaggerated left politics, even if this policy is supposed to be committed to it or if it means they have to do it right, they simply want to be treated normally.
Back to the right, since of course police and armed forces are also a cross section of society, you will also find extreme rights there, but they can openly express their opinion there or even openly forge any state-threatening plans is completely exaggerated and annoys me too.
Of course, policemen and soldiers who were often in foreign use often start to pause due to negative experiences and even say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also happens that there are some right contemporaries who encounter a lively exchange of thoughts.
Nevertheless, I believe that this is a good fight and is also countered by political education and education!
Germany is so internationally entangled and that is also good in my opinion that we could not afford to have proper racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
Yes, what I don't understand, I ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why would this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I ordered in November.
but it was confirmed in your confirmation of the order
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I used to chat with #NAME#.
Alternatively, you could deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in black to Germany or is this basket in Germany also available somewhere.
I always find only you as a partner company.
but above the edge of the wood piece are two deep sticks that were filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
More ordinary through a child?
Hello, me (w32) has been busy one thing for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work, (in self-employed, very little leisure time), but already my life I get it more bad than right to keep my household permanently clean and tidy.
There are always phases in which everything remains, and then and when it takes me and I to clean up and clean up.
But it's never really 'that someone could come to visit spontaneously'.
My husband is not (sorry) better either, but it bothers me somewhere but mostly household simply loses against work and unemployment.
The kitchen is still regularly cleaned as we like to cook.
Now on my question, did you manage to get better with a child?
We don't have a job yet, and this question has been bothering me for a long time.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me so much as long as no visit comes and e.g. there are always fresh clothes and the kitchen can be used.
Does one have a bigger incentive with a child, or does one remain slutty?
Look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality and anatomically preformed cut, offers a maximum of comfort, a perfect fit and enables almost unlimited freedom of movement.
Preforming with special, further embossing on the joints for improved freedom of movement (to arm and knee bends)
For the Focea Comfort 4 the surface covered by the Flex System was more than doubled in the Flex System 2 in order to further increase the comfort.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (axes, elbows and knees)
High-quality moldings in the lower back area and in the step ensure a tight, perfect seat.
Elaskin 8.8 Stretch Panel in the lumbar vertebral area increases the flexibility around the back zipper and thereby improves the comfort, especially when bending and mounting the equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone which is located around the shoulders and back guarantees increased flexibility in arm and back movements.
Fireskin is a heating, water repellent material with a special surface structure that offers a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) sealing on the face at the hood increases the comfort, sealing and durability (separate scalp)
Soft, collared zone improves sealing with a fine-adjustable wide adjustment by a flexible, gentle Velcro closure, which is not attached to the lashing or seams
Double cuffs with zipper on arm and foot joints combine a wrapable inner cuff with a soft, shaded neoprene outer cuff
45° stitching at the end of the inner cuff for increased elasticity and elasticity when tightening.
Long zipper on the neck with an Elaskin reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort on the overall without hood
Long G-Lock P back zipper (overall without hood) with metal slider and integrated water dam system for improved sealing (beuchat patent)

Neopren panels neatly glued with external and internal overlap
Edges of the outer cuffs lined for greater loadability
Edges of the inner cuffs carved for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat system was designed to fix the computer in place, especially at deeper dives (the system is compatible with all common bracelet computers)
Career in social work - as someone with a self-insecure personality disorder?
I have been training in the field of software development and have been trained for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I see more and more that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have thought for a long time to start again and study social work.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or scary avoiding) personality disorder (EVPS).
That means roughly that I have no self-esteem and am therefore shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but I find it very difficult to have relaxed discussions and I have been told more often that I am working inextricably (I think that has already improved).
Can I become a social worker?
I do not want to work as a street worker or in an open youth meeting, but rather in the search for advice or family assistance.
However, I do not know whether the working day really is the way I imagine it to be, and it is difficult to find something on the Internet.
The ÄVPS is already causing problems in my job (for me, emotionally) because it always pulls me down when there is something to be bothered about in my code ("skin down the simplest things again") and it is hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues to help ("I should really know for myself how to do it"/"I should keep him with my stupid questions from work"/"who really has to think of me as less important" etc.).
I will probably have the problems in every profession, but I wanted to mention it in the place.
Did you get the sofa back yet?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I'm waiting for an appointment to pick up
What do you mean, give it back?
If I have downloaded a book to the #PRS_ORG#, the message will not be your #PRS_ORG# authenticated this book
Are there any problems?
I was in chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I got a delivery confirmation for my closet.
The protein (protein) absorbed with the feed divides the bird into the individual protein building materials (amino acids) in its gastro-intestinal tract and in turn builds up its own proteins, which it also needs to form spring.
Feather formation in nestling and re-formation in the muttering bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high level of stress for the overall organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding, as there may otherwise be disturbances in the brooding course.
Following this curative administration of NECTON-Bio, it was appropriate to return to the daily supply of vitamin with NECTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NECTON-MSA (mineral compound preparation).

1 g NECTON-Bio on 250 ml water or 100 g soft feed.
It is only recommended to prepare as much drinking water/soft feed as the bird consumes daily and to change water/food daily.
A coated measuring spoon (inside) corresponds to 1 g of NECTON-Bio.
In case of severe spring damage, a double or triple dose of NEKTON can be given at the beginning until the re-formation approach is visible.
Thereafter, the normal dose is reached until the spring re forming is complete.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sun exposure, between 15° and 25°C.
I'm sorry, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair be broken after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
That's really bad service.
Hello, I sent an e-mail on Monday to inform you that my order has arrived damaged and pictures have been attached.
Have you received this e-mail?
Statement by a municipal staff member in reply to the Statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have this problem.
On our property a walnut tree is to be liked.
So, fall application made to the community.
An employee writes to me that the fall of fruit trees and thus also the walnut is not part of the statutes.
However, the statutes explicitly state the walnut as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the Statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the them new packaging for it.
I have not received any message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I think that only the question is: can I pay in euros and have the ceiling delivered to Germany?
Can you check it out?
Report: heavy road accident at Self
A serious traffic accident has recently occurred on the St 2179 between the connection point Self-Nord and Plößberg.
As the police press alarm announces (14:03 p.m.), a car has arrived in counter-trafficking.
There are injured people.
Ah okay, understand.
Well, then thank you so much again that it was so easy!
Council and ideas on further professional life
Happy Christmas to you first!
My Christmas is, unfortunately, moderately good, because my dear head is just ruining everything you can think about.
Before I get out here .. in short: I need advice and best of people who know my situation somehow - so of you.
I'm doing the ref as a cross-integer right now.
Originally I studied something else and worked there in one area (to at least stay a little anonymous, I don't call anything more precise here).
But the whole thing was too boring for me then and I looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
Someday I landed at the Teaching Office and was sure that it is - even though the framework conditions are much more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I have now arrived at the third "I Google other job offers".
And it's only half a year away.
I have always decided to go ahead and at least finish the Ref, after which I can still go around.
But right now I'm absolutely done.
I've had so little time off for the past month that I've completely exhausted.
Now is a vacation, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the Ref I always thought I was stress-resistant, but there was my weekend and my holiday evening.
I was free there.
And the stress at work didn't matter in the moments.
Now the family celebration is too much stress to me.
And then there are these rigid structures that make me nervous.
Basically it is fun and seen from the outside the Ref also runs well as far as the feedback and so on.
But I'm completely exhausted and wonder how much stress my body has before it closes completely - if it doesn't already.
I wonder if I would like this to be done for the rest of my working life - especially if I read some of the contributions from you here - or if I should not go back to the old area, where I was valued, to take my time off if I needed it, and the work found somehow boring, but was properly paid for it and worked together in a team that worked out what and not as a single fighter like that is the most time of the case.
But then I wonder if I haven't arrived again in the same place in a year as now and have been dissatisfied.
You know, it's all kind of messy, but maybe you've come out of this situation as outside counsel or ideas, which I'm completely done crying at the slightest thought.
I'm not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, which probably leads to nothing good.
But perhaps your views help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me first.
Thank you for reading and apologies for the weeping undertone of me.
I hope my situation has at least become a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, the VOX Valvetronix series has developed steadily, which has led, among other things, to the combination of advanced modelling technology with the "Valve Reactor" cutting, which perfectly replicates the behaviour of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we present a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely up-to-date in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET (Virtual Element Technology) technology, which is based on the analysis of components and amp switches, the VTX amplifiers are waiting with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amps also, of course, contain the multistage Valvetronix tube preamp.
This is partly based on real analogue circuits, because they simply get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances only sprang out.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and the effects sound as you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology presented in 2001.
Of course, it has since been refined several times in order to meet new added sound requirements, which in 2010 has once again led to a shift in performance of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics as well as numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series was also designed so that all guitarists will find a maximum sound range here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amp: they expect a bold sound, a nuanced play of game dynamics and string attack as well as a prompt speech.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that, in particular, the end stage determined the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology on the basis of this finding.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier fitted with a 12AX7 tube perfectly reflects the behaviour, subtle nuances and the sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points of Wagner: Magic loses at Clippers
The defeat series of Orlando Magic in the NBA stops.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it is not enough to win the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points of Franz Wagner and seven counters of his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost at the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday 104:106.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually spaceable and foldable Velcros, it aligns itself to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format mirror reflector cameras.
What ultimately fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lens.
A possible fitting would be a DSLR camera with an on-set lens, two to three alternate lenses and a light flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the different models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for further lenses.
In addition, you can store a lot of accessories.
And whoever has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for its equipment and for photo-residence.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the backpack offers sufficient space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcano eruption on La Palma: probably the longest of history
In the almost three months since the outbreak, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is there an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days now, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the famous history of the Spanish Canary Islands since Sunday.
So far, the eruption of Tehuya volcano occurred in 1585 with 84 days as the longest on the Atlantic island in front of the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still nameless volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased slightly in recent days, but volcanologists have not dared to predict when it could end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, the state TV channel RTVE.
Damage at millions
In the almost three months since the outbreak, the more than 1,000 degrees hot lava has destroyed almost 2900 homes and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Nearly 1200 hectares were covered by a thick layer of lava.
That corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, damage estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Two new landings with a total size of about 50 hectares were created off the coast by cold-cold lava.
It was particularly affected by the huge banana cultivation, of which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, other areas severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is in front of the door and especially the children will hardly be able to expect the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have connected with the spiritual atmosphere and the crushing tension something seductive in itself.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that keep our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which, according to French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss, had been a peace-providing "competition treaty of natural peoples", can be emigrated and refilled with life in the context of this tradition.
How Nikolaus became the child of Christ
It was strictly accepted by the Protestants, through which the Christmas days were closely linked to the consecration.
Previously on Nikolaustag presents were presented in one way or another.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas as Bishop of Myra secretly threw three women into her window one night to save them another life in sin.
From this unconventional way of giving, the custom popular in Germany emerged to fill the boots with gifts, especially for the children.
Protestants came across this custom because they reject mediators between God and man as "holy worship".
For these reasons, they are acting against the institution.
Martin Luther made the Christ child from Nikolaus and established a new line of tradition.
The focus of the confession thus shifted to the holy evening.
However, since most Protestants no longer see such details so closely, it only annoys the least that the custom of Saint Nicholas, similar to the Martin’s use of Martinsingen and Martins move, is still a fixed part of the pre-Christmas period.
Today you will find in boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to luxury watches all that the heart desires.
Variety of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources prove a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the reformation, the day of the gift shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, in all Christianly influenced countries, there is a happy Kuddelmuddel on the question who is now bringing the gifts to the children.
In Germany it depends on the region in question, whether the child of Christ appears on the Holy Evening or the Santa Claus, who is in principle a kind of Nikolaus, who in time were assigned some species of his own.
This includes, for example, its white rust bar, which has little more common with the rather strict Assyrian bar of the historical figure, its sled, which is drawn by reindeer and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who should have led them the way to the Child of Jesus.
In Scandinavia sometimes fabled beings bring gifts, while in Russia it brought some fame to fathers Frost.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses who pull their sleds as troika.
In the Czech Republic, the mother country of the Reformation in the course of the Hussite Wars, the child is responsible for handing over the gifts.

Police are shooting suspected bank robbers near the Royal Palace.
Near Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
The police reported that callers had reported a man who was supposed to have gone to a bank with a gun and a bookmaker's business.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle which could be stopped a little later by officials.
The shots fell and the man was hit.
He was still declared dead at the crime scene.
The police did not leave a terrorist background.
Several messages are located in the Kensington Palace area.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.

In the Hollywood spectacle, there are mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies that give inwardly colored.
On the other hand, "Smart Stone" is quite harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar light shines fascinatingly – preferably in white or colored light (in six different shades of colour).
The edgeless, amorphous design is consciously selected: Like a natural-shaped large pebble, this modern light object presents itself day by day.
Its organic rounds fit into every natural environment – whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stonebed.

Place the "lightstone" in any place from the sun, day by day.
Two pins supplied provide a firm hold when needed.
The matt white plastic cover itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar module conceals »Smart Stone« discreetly inside, together with its battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
In the event of a shocking dusk, "Smart Stone" starts to shine automatically; in which color you decide yourself: You can choose the same six attractive light colors – besides daylight white.
After all, the switch-off takes place automatically as soon as the battery charging level is reduced to a specified minimum or it becomes bright again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle begins the next day from the front.
I've done that several times already. It doesn't work.

Pill problems
Hello, dear lady people,
I hope I do everything right here, is after a year actually reddit my first post.
To my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had so incredibly bad pain during the period and shitty PMS before the period.
Now I would like to keep it back, because I have to take enough medicines because of chronic diseases that I can't choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
At my last two-year break, I had gotten from 0 to 100 explosive spikes everywhere.
In so far as it was so superficial, but I was quite burdened by it and I didn't feel well.
In the two-year break the whole thing has never really normalized.
Maybe someone has any tips to avoid this.
Perfume free and without teeth is my cosmetics already, but maybe there's what someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the woman doctor didn't take me so seriously and the skin doctor's appointment is still coming.
Thank you very much to everyone who has read the novel through!
Yes, dear skin is such a thing.
Had pre-bupertary severe neurodermatitis, then a time of rest, then large-scale nodule braid and the acne theme.
I have also tried everything possible in the course of chr. disease and have stayed on down sugar, milk and meat-poor mixed food, because otherwise nothing has worked so well.
It can also be good that Hormonell is just the worm in there, but if you like me have a construction site everywhere you'd rather not go looking for what else is going on.
I already had all her colleague Semina o. a.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was answered to my concerns.
I always have to work in between and on the phone and there was all of a sudden...
What's there to check if the money was there, I would have seen it.
Check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong.
but there is it generally in large

In the name of the people: lay judges
They sit in the courtroom in everyday clothes on the judge's bench.
But much depends on their judgment, even if they don't wear robes: Schöfn determines with professional judges whether and how long someone goes behind bars.

110-kV ground cable is being rebuilt in 2022
The authorisation for the installation of the new high voltage cable at Tann is valid.
The planning decision of the government of Niederbayern clears the way for construction to begin in 2022.
This was now announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The earth cable will connect the Tann transformer plant in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected near the village of Edermanning at Reut to a mast of the free line.
Good morning,
my order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has so far only arrived in parts with us.
The blue bet number:#PRS_ORG# with the send number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the notice "Not possible".
All three other packages have arrived so that delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me how the next process is now?
A nice start in the week!
You can forget that, I explained that several times yesterday!!
This is a dresser made of glass and the entire sides are burst, so there is glass everywhere and the carton is broken
The dresser stands in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come to the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG# regulations
This means that the dresser can't be picked up because no one can get into my apartment
Thanks for the message
but why only EUR 20?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it's for all the books, so the question at #PRS_ORG#, because it's probably a general problem.
Ref: Teaching plan (EC)
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I have been in Ref since summer, teaching is fun, but I still have great problems to plan my education in the field of geography for time.
Unfortunately, my school is technically not well equipped, so that in principle I can only use the tablet, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
In school, I can only copy b/w free of charge (which is annoying).
I just need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently doing the topic geofactors and with me is actually every hour.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand I do not want to invest excessive time for simple lessons (I also need UBs, etc.).
I always go out of the learning goal in planning (what I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it (mostly I create a work paper with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
Therefore, the worksheets are also.
Maybe I can get a professor of physics to work with the book for a while.
I'd really appreciate it.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
In fact, I have already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would be happy to handle the return as soon as possible for the first time.
The trade fears for the 2G rule for the Christmas business.
In most shops, only those who are vaccinated or healed may be allowed.
Trade considers this to be unnecessary and lamented sales disruptions.
A possible solution is also ready.
From the point of view of the German Trade Association (HDE), the 2G regulations remove the important Christmas business from the retail trade.
In shops with articles of non-daily need, sales disruptions were to be lamented, criticised HDE chief executive Stefan Genth.
According to a current HDE survey of 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies looked negatively at the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive peak of the year is now often a hole without soil," said Genth.
Traders with 2G access restrictions lost almost one third of their pre-crisis revenues in the past week.
Good running it only in the food retail trade as well as in the online sector.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with mask, distance and hygiene concept was a safe matter," said the chief manager.
"2G when shopping does not bring us any further in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations deterred customers and required high staff use.
He demanded that the tape regime be approved nationwide.
Thereafter, each customer had to be checked only once for 2G (vaccinated or cured) and would have access to all shops with the received tape on that day.
In addition, in retail trade, as in public transport, sampling should be sufficient at the level of the 3G rules (immunised, cured or tested).
The real estate group Deutsche Euroshop, specialized in shopping centres, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
Last but not least, the frequencies were around 75 percent of the pre-Corona level without 2G, the turnover was around 90 percent.
These figures will now fall safely in the middle of the so important Christmas business," said Chief Executive Officer Wilhelm Wellner of the "Economic Week".
Due to the high level of personnel and administrative effort, the Center is being tried to find solutions and get approved.
This includes the so-called tape solution in which "the visitors can, for example, enter their 2G card at a central location in the center once and thereafter - equipped with a bracelet similar to that in a club hotel - undisturbedly enter all shops". dpa
I recently ordered and delivered the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratcher and on the frame is also an error that was tried with a yellow filler to be lashed.
That doesn't look nice.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and glued it to it.
How do I have to proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high colour rendering.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities provides for setting the colour temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to the adjustment of the brightness, there are two standard colour temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually adjust and store the colour temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the Flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is easy and intuitive to use.
The lamp produces a very light stream with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The angle of radiation of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at relatively small distances, is excellent.
By the way, also in reporting situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on the film set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in hard-to-access places.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
User Storage The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
In order to perform the settings of the individual settings on the disks, one of the memory keys is simply loaded and finished by longer pressing.
The memory controller saves the current state of the lamp when it is switched off, so that when it is switched on, the known situation is restored - very practical when it comes to studio work, for example, when the camera is set to certain colour temperatures.
Working with battery one of the biggest strengths of DL3120 functionality is the possibility of operating with cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can use existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester same with built-in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the left battery above display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlamp with electricity above the supplied power supply.
The structure of the headlamp is very simple.
For fixing you have a 16mm sleeve as a connection, so you can directly to your photo stand.
The inclination shall be reliably adjusted on both sides by means of a detection device.
It was considered that the mechanical components are also extremely high-quality and therefore also designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, a nail joint is included in the delivery.
It is a great thing that is also included in the delivery.
So you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you may still want to buy, without any problems.
Shame I have received and it is too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after a dry comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two-time series of seglosic Hessen were supposed to be on their way to the next Bundesliga track.
But then the SGE turned up, and within a good hour, threw off the frustration over a season start of the soul and won furios with 5:2. "It's madness what the boys did today," coach Oliver Glasner cheered at DAZN and said a "Pauscal praise, to each one who was with them".
At first it looked after a new damper for the Frankfurter, now in rank nine, still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had led the Leverkuseners with 2:0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE trainer.
"As the players then returned and showed a fantastic performance," continued Glasner.
I am insanely happy with the performance we have shown and of course also with the result.
Also, defenseman Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the place for the first time since the fourth day of the game and his overcome muscle injury, stressed the morals of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly big," said the 27-year-old and rejoiced with a glance at the result especially for the viewers.
That was the party we wanted to throw out today.
But Glasner wants to keep the focus on the upcoming tasks, but he also sees himself well positioned in terms of the staff situation.
It is extraordinary that we have all players fit in December that all players are physically in a top constitution.
It is top work in our medical department, but also the players live highly professional.
Now you want to "go on step by step and keep modest" and carry out the tasks until the turn of the year "at this level".
Next on Wednesday, in the course of the English week, there will be an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 hrs, Sky) on the program.
Grads I get the mail that my package comes back to you due to a mistake on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and let it redirect, no chance.
Can it be sent to me directly again or do I have to wait until the money has been returned and the order is due again?
I would then regret to say that I will not be ordering again because it has been going on for a long time.
Have you ever been to the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Handball women dampers in front of quarter finals against Spain
After humiliation against Denmark, Germany's handball women related to hanging heads and empty views from the parquet.
At the end of the World Cup's main round, the DHB election at 16:32 (8:13) cast a hard defeat for 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to face Spain in the quarter final.
"We were far too scared and had too much respect for the opponent," judged Federal Trainer Henk Groener.
We must act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danes (10:0).
I'm sorry we couldn't take the flow.
This was a bad game we have to delete," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the struggle for entry into the semifinals, a significant increase must be made against the 2019 World Cup-Second on Tuesday to keep the delicate dream of the first medal alive since 2007.
The best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was back-room player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We just weren't there - neither in the attack, nor in the defense," Xenia Smits cleared the back room and demanded, "we need to look forward quickly."
From front to back not at height
Unlike the previous five tournaments, the German team with the Anpfiff was not on high.
Mistakes and technical faults in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a fast 0:4 recovery after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented with some parades worse.
The first goal succeeded the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counter-return.
The expected initial inflammation, however, was not this.
The German women could hardly stand up to the aggressive coverage of the Danes - and if so, they mostly failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of Scandinavia.
Thus, the game had run early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since backstage player Mia Zshock saw red too little later because of a tough foul on her opponent.
But it can be played back in the quarter finals.
Only in the final phase of the first half-time did the DHB selection come into play a little better and until the break at least on five goals.
The only quiet hope for a catch-up after the change was already there after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Greenlanders sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-designed opponent, who is one of the medal candidates at the final round.
As a result, the German team was no longer able to catch up on a performance increase and went out of the park as a clear loser.

The title is available, I am working as a vaccine in mobile vaccination teams where (until now only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated in nursing homes.
As these are soon to be ready for a large part, it goes on to some of the vaccination centres for me.
I would like to answer questions without a time limit on organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, if they are not personal (e.g. "I take medicine X, this deals with vaccination.").
In my area of responsibility, the information for vaccination, indication (person is entitled to vaccination according to Corona vaccination regulations and no reason to speak against it), medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency care in case of allergic reactions (I have never done so).
The vaccination itself is delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical professionals.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have any but "only" (for God's sake, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the vaccine preparation, but who cannot carry out vaccinations (do need?), so that I also perform most vaccinations myself there.
Heavy "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What's a "Huidler"?
With this dialectic word, sent by an Amberger, the BR TV program "We in Bavaria" has provided intense thought.
But unlike on many previous days, the term in the series "Host mi?" remained unspeakable by the callers this time.
No, it wasn't a "man who's nervous."
And no one, "that everything has to go fast."
That, the people heard from the TV hostess were completely wrong.
On what the man from Amberg announced the solution and with it probably also caused many upper posts to be amazed.
"The Skindler," the audience learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes out the oven".
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been interviewing Bavarian television as an expert for years, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical upper part, derived somehow from the rather well-known word "houders".
Which closed an educational gap - probably also in some that have long lived in the Amberg area.
I haven't been able to buy books in two weeks.
It always comes after confirmation the following error message: opens - something wont wrong - try again later.
I re-started the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, connected to the PC, synchronized and repaired.
Nothing helped.
The choice of tyres in the racing bike - really so armory?
This morning I woke up full of action because I wanted to train at least a little to prepare my bike tour in the next week.
Said, done and I drove my racing bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then that what happened in so every city center (this time: Thank you Krefeld!) lurked.
Glass splitter on the track.
Zack, loud squeezing and my back tires were no longer going to take part in the rest of the track.
Because of the day of the week, I had no real way to get a replacement jacket and a spare hose, I had to turn around with a bit of a bad mood and take the first train home.
It was not quite so bad then, perhaps it is also better if I practice the tyre change again before the bike tour.
But now I'm facing a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long route over several days ahead of me, I would be extremely sorry for this problem more often.
Now it was really not bad, since the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, on the day I came to pick up the bike till 2:00 p.m.) and who had already called it suboptimal because he had been driving with them for more years on the roll.
But if I think I have to make a change of tire when driving to 80-90kms, then I think I'm really bad at this :D
Now I got into a conversation with an older man on the platform who surprised me why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; these should be unflatterable.
Now, of course, this sounds very tempting.
But are these really so incalculable?
I don't want to spend 40€/tips now just to be disappointed.
I also ask myself: I think I have 25x622 at the moment on the race bike.
They are also (apparently?) available at the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you recommend me to other tires in general on a racing bike?
The Schwalbe page seems to be my absolute! Laiewissen rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for the help and love greetings!
Car slams against tree: driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old was raided on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for unexplained cause against a Middle Island and then entered the counterroads, as the police announced.
There came a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was hurled against a tree and the man was stuck in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passengers were seriously injured in the accident and taken to surrounding hospitals.

After the release of our new high end wideband B 100-6 OHM it was only a matter of time until our SOLO series would also get young again.
Solo 15 is the new sprangling and is visually reminiscent of the great models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this construction proposal, a suitable designed foot is directly included in order to raise the speaker to the correct hearing position.
It has no influence on acoustics and can therefore be adapted in the length according to the conditions at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very suitable for people in whom the maximum volume plays a rather minor role, but sounds to achieve an exceptionally high level.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not able to produce almost unfiltered sound pressure levels like this.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, they grow up remarkably and appear extremely impressive and accurate for their size.
The SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight rise in the pitch.
This is generally used in widebands to optimize the too high frequencies of large bundles.
The SOLO 15 convinces precisely on the hearing area with a very clear and fine sound.
The high-tone range can easily be rotated outwards, thus making the sound picture warmer.
Thanks to the sound source, the placement of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereoangle is sharp and amazingly precise.
The reference suspects extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure a fine dynamic that it seeks the same.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but extends it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to start by thinking about the final optics of the speaker in order to plan appropriate changes during construction.
For example, if you want to veneer the housing, you need to adjust the reduction of the speaker accordingly, as the veneer again carries material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. in the construction market), you should first drill an 8 mm hole into the ground plate at the corresponding point, in order to be able to perform the cable without any problems there.
With the help of an upper milling machine, the speaker opening follows in the front so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used in an abrupt manner later.
Reverse this opening should be provided with a 45° bevel to make the opening surface of the speaker chassis as large as possible inside.
The four screw points of the B 100 - 6 OHM are interrupted in the phase, as shown in the picture "Detail Phase".
Then you start with the actual structure of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
On these the back wall, the lid, the front and the ground are glued up.
The three stiffeners should also be used and glued.
The stiffenings themselves may vary in the thickness of the material when needed, for example, if one wants to use finished loads from the construction market instead of producing them from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side is attached.
After that all the plates of the foot, so the two sides, as well as the front follow.
The fitting of the bass reflex tube and the terminal on the back wall is facilitated by a suitable circular saw or a wood drill.
Then you use a round cutter to round all edges of the actual box.
The top of the base can also be rounded off.
After that, the foot plate is glued firmly with the foot of the housing and additionally screwed with long wooden screws.
It follows the drawing and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drills) of the screw points of the speaker chassis and the connector clamp.
After cleaning the housing of wood dust (bow/bow out), start laying the cable.
The 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall is the easiest way to do this.
The entire and uncut cable can be moved piece by piece through the 8 mm bore to the foot until the terminal opening and let it stand out about 30 cm there.
In the upper part of the housing you lead the cable to the speaker opening and make it easy to hang out there.
The frequency week is then prepared and used.
The construction plan of the frequency path, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be found in the following document: Assembly instruction Weiche Solo 15.
If the crossover is installed and the terminal is screwed, the seal of the 8 mm cable opening is followed inside the box, which is not yet completely closed.
Due to the 35 mm bassREFLEX opening and with some skill, you can drop hot glues onto the opening and lock them like this.
Through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp you can check the sealing accordingly.
Now follow the damping according to the description.
Then the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and screwed with the corresponding screws.
Polarity plays an important role in this, so that the plus line (marked cable) has to be tilted at the plus pole of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I give up an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
> Hello to all,
> at last we can announce that we will be holding the OSCAST again this year!
> Unfortunately, for well-known reasons, it is not possible to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-term announcement.
ABER: There will be at least three people by switch, so we will track the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it is still pandemic – yet we will give everything to accompany the Oscars as entertainingly as possible.
> It will start about 0:30.
If you are already cold drinks, plan good food and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
