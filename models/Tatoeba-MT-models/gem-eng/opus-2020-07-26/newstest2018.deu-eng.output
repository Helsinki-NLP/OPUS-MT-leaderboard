Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
A misplaced institution where young people are to meet today.
A burial chapel, where the S-Bahn tunnel is now dug.
Kleingärtner manages the former land of peasants.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories to days.
It's annoying if maps aren't up to date.
Anyone who had to get excited before knows this, because the car Navi showed a green meadow instead of a roundabout road.
The historical maps of the digital Bayern atlas, an offer of the Bayern Geoportal of the State Government, are anything but current - but that is precisely why it is very revealing.
Especially if you compare them with current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread of the Munich Mercury since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern Atlas is a patchwork that is not recognized as such.
More detailed maps, so-called Urposition sheets, have been included in the large overview map for cities and municipalities.
According to information from the Bavarian survey management between 1810 and 1864, these were born and are the first survey of Bavaria.
Your client: Napoleon.
The French army leader has occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.
Although the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville from February 9, 1801, today's neighbors created the idea of a comprehensive Bavarian map.
Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph further advanced the project, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bayerische Vermeerungsverwaltung.
The Urpositionblatt for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bavarian Landesbibliothek, just like everyone else.
The comparison Earlier/Today is the most impressive example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which still appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was included 21 years after the map was created, i.e. 1877, as the Munich district.
Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.
The Houses of Untersendlings concentrate around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was first named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.
Where today is the West Park, you can see nothing but fields - at first sight: When zooming in, a smaller map appears with dozens of lines and numbers: handwrittenly numbered hall pieces from the so-called "uptake" from which the land tax was derived.
Small parcels no longer produce farmers there - but small gardeners of the "Land in Sun" plant.
A large green area stands north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 venue of the Oktoberfest, was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionblatt one reads in the territory of today's district of Au-Haidhausen not only the street name "am Gasteig" or the height "On the airs" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on Auerfeldstraße, people were once locked up with delusions.
There, 1858/59 the Munich Kreis-Irrenanstalt "On the Auer Luften" was created.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chaining of so-called fools.
In addition, he has forbidden the staff to use violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, Head of the Museum Haidhausen, who has worked with the institution for an exhibition.
For 280 patients, place had been first, later expanded to 500 places.
Sometime this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar 1905.
Since 2006 there is the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatry.
Young people in the Salesianum can now meet on the site of the former Auer Anstalt.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training companies.
To the west lies the football pitch of the TSV München East, east residential houses from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - in architectural adjective to the original construction of the lunatic institution, which had been destroyed during World War II during bombing.
The Marienplatz was named after Kaufinger Gasse in 1856 as the main square.
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
In December 1944, the Allied bombs broke many holes into the city center.
A large one remained until today - at Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a medieval burial chapel once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preliminary work and on April 5, 2017 the spatula for the second S-Bahn-Stammstrecke took place.
With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and the hole at Marienhof can be filled up.
Citizens' Rights Group Releases Travel Warnings for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Coloring has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is due to enter into force by 28 August 2017, calls on Afro-American travellers, visitors and Missouri to pay special attention to travel through the state and to take extreme care, as a number of questionable, racial-based incidents have occurred in the state and are noted here," says the Group's opinion.
A recently adopted Missouri law that makes it more difficult for people to obtain discrimination complaints, as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state, which aim at disproportionate minorities, prompted the group to issue travel warning, said NAACP.
"They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten together or killed," said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard."
It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under dubious circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more gasoline during the journey through the state and was taken to custody by Missouri police without being charged with any crime.
The Council also points to a recent report by Missouri's Attorney General's Office showing that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more often than whites.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People must be ready to bring bail or let the relatives know that they are travelling through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate-crime report program, which ranked the state in terms of the number of such violations to the 16th place of the country.
Travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently stakeholders have taken the action in response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Weidezaun project is elemental
The Fischerbach Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year.
On the spot, the CDU members Peter White and Kordula Kovac created a picture.
At the Brechtgrabenhof of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbach CDU-Ortsverband met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members.
Markus Schwendemann first gave insights into his business, where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, provides 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommodates guests in five apartments.
The "Black Forest Milk" is for him the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, says Schwendemann.
At the table of the holiday guests comes only regional.
Since he is also BLHV Chairman of Fischerbach, he called the Weidezaun project "elementar important".
I can't make any profit on such steep areas.
The greenland area ensures a lot of work, a lot of work had to be done with the motorsense.
"We have to fight with conditions and topography here," said Schwendemann.
In 2003, he took over the parent plant and manage it without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he does not run a bio farm.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the Weidezaun project and is happy about the funding of the Leader".
For costs ranging from EUR 3000 to 4000 per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.
It is hoped that this will allow the reforestation of the areas to continue for a long time.
"The biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they carry on their business," said the mayor.
Farmers are often criticised because of the promotion
In 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were encapsulated about the grass-roots promotion.
The area of the open air thus amounts to 40 hectares, which must not be reforested until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of 71,500 euros, half was funded via Leader, one quarter was owned by the municipality of Fischerbach.
The farmers thus remained at EUR 12 610, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fence.
"The great advantage is the longevity of fences," said Schwendemann.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You're doing a really good job without farmers and farmers."
Peter Weiß also stated: "Best food is produced here".
The Landscape Care Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state promotion of pasture fences.
The aim is to maintain the open position of the Black Forest.
There is a prerequisite for the existence of a supporting backdrop as described by the LPR.
Moreover, the fenced area must not be towable (absence above 35 per cent) and must therefore be threatened by reforestation.
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaun project 2018, the application is currently being made by eight participants with 24 parcels, who want to build a fence almost 16 kilometres.
The ceiling is 35 hectares and the estimated cost is more than 112,000 euros.
Is nothing more sacred?
Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty
The safest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the president's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.
To stay fair, Miller didn't attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would've slowed him down if he had done it.
But he attacked their meaning, and in particular the meaning attributed to it, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to its basis in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument.
When Miller Acosta lamented: "I don't want to go into a whole thing about history, but the statue of freedom is ... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem to which you refer, which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller's factually correct, but as he put it himself, it's not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus' uplifting words, the only ones in which a state invites not only some old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your fatigue, your poor, /your distressed masses, who yearn to breathe freely, /the miserable waste of your rich shores."
There was never a time when the "old waste" on our screens was better to see.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's USA.
This conflict over the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends, who were committed to placing their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they were doing a high-political act.
The sculpture was to show the connections between French and American republicanism by representing the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical portrayal.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a completely different name: the mother of the exiles.
The connection of the poem to the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people wanted to change this from the right wing for a long time.
The great Screaming Neck Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for Trump's coming, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would invite no one, but would rather be an early neoconservative that would bring the American flame into the overnight world: "Lady Liberty is progressing.
It is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not supposed to illuminate the way to the United States."
It's pretty unusual that Limbaugh came across something here.
The meaning of the statue is entirely a question of the position of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, wretched, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
In the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear.
And of course, that's not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.
Their torch is not to illuminate the path, but to ignite the hatred, which is its only source of power.
2017 World Championship: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the team of Great Britain
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the team of Great Britain
The performance director of the United Kingdom's athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the World Cup framework "will make a massive contribution to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "it has developed something special in Scotland" and that the United Kingdom's athletics need to learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue until we find out," Black said.
"I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they've done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they've done.
British Athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain by the team.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible," Black says.
"A number of athletes, regardless of whether they were Scottish or wherever they lived or practiced, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought in, of course, were great."
The Commonwealth Silver medal winner, who will take part in the 400-m-Hürden World Championships, says that it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's best overall number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.
Muir, a medium-range runner, is heading this way and last year he has compiled five British and two European records.
It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another shot to watch after a great season that included the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other shooter in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says that she is "excellently proud" of the fact that many of her countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases will be part of the medals and the finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and chose me makes it a very special thing for me," she added.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team.
It just shows how far we have come.
And they're here as established athletes, athletes who want to get up on podiums.
What about my speech as Captain?
Yeah, I think she was fine.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home-world championship.
So it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from being back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to get out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there."
Blocking critics over Facebook: Don't apply for a public office if you can't put up with the heating of voters
Our father knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to beat him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.
He mocked at the criticism, sure.
But he did not silence his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "The freedom of speech can be taken away - and, dumb and dumb, we are led like sheep to battle."
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan's staff have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that at the beginning of this week.
The staff of the governor dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?" .
"It's just Facebook," many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state, which is surprisingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict respect of the principles.
He was also very skilled in using Facebook as the primary means to connect with his constituents and to play his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, the blocking of people who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum that is officially called and paid by employees with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing but a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people who swing the whips online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who talk to their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profan.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, M.D., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the comment area of the "The Post".
"I don't appreciate this idea, either, if a number of people have a position on the same subject, they are ignored by some rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens".
What the governor's employees referred to as "concentrated spam attack" would probably call others "pre-talk".
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in earlier times if you would have done the same thing that employees have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or to arrest and silence demonstrators.
But that's exactly what happens digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for having insulted Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this question fell in Virginia last week.
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Justice James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voters from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so hard.
At Washington's time of affordable shipping had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous writers appealed to his leadership.
And even back then, Washington had anonymous Trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
Petitions that criticised his view on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with the United Kingdom overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project.
But he didn't silence her.
Freedom of speech, disagreements and discourses form the basis of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for domestic comfort in the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will host the 25th edition of Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who led links to the final round next to the Archerfield last year before losing against Paul Eales, is associated with the new venue and serves as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've seen how the Renaissance club was built, and we see how it achieves its glory with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course from its best side, it is in a great state.
Jerry did a great job fixing this place.
He is a zealous defender of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great window for this course."
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"That feels really special," said the player in Southport.
"I have not been able to defend the Extremadura Open since it was removed from the program in the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate."
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to the action on home floor.
This event will be its first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do well, but you also feel this extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I'm glad how it went."
With the trio in the field are the former masters winner Ian Woosnam and the senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and the former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free, the parking costs £5 per car with one passenger and £10 per car with two or more passengers.

Reduced lung cancer rate due to passive smoking
Over the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer due to passive smoking.
Scientists at the Hamburg-Eppendorf University Hospital (UKE) are coming to this conclusion in a study.
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer cases per year are due to passive smoke," said study director Heiko Becher.
In comparison, he conducted his own study on this subject from 1994.
At that time, there were still 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Home connections appear to be very complex
The construction work in Villinger Straße is in full swing and "is in some respects in time", says the head of the Fred Heinze Bauhof.
In the area of household connections, the situation was more complicated than supposed, as in the underground much is hidden, which is not stated in the plans.
The traffic, which repeatedly hinders construction work, is a major problem for the Stumpp construction group.
"The ignorance of the drivers in front of red lights and dampers is already enormous," says Heinze.
The road is locked and only the buses are entitled to transit.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp are working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were already quite strenuous.
But luckily, we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt," says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia Goldland
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She even rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai government in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually places a sweet potato - locally referred to as "nota" - directly in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the bald lump is removed and swallowed with zealous, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also carries out her daily work, for example to wash clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, no fields were assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, late working can be dangerous: Most village men are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are the soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.," she says.
It is a rare glimpse into the daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote by a public hand-picking in front of the crews.
An existing movement, which led to independence against the Dutch rule, quickly turned against the Jakarta government, which has the control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent region of Papua New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is deserted. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour drive by car.
There is no public transport.
The city with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, and of corrugated roofs converted by rust into different yellowish-brown tones.
Only a few Indonesians have made their journey here, not to mention journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuan worshipped a god called Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," said Degei, pointing to their lively handwoven Turban, their dark shirt and their bright skirt.
"In the past, we only had leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's gold land.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grassberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is only 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport has reduced the value of 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has wood resources worth estimated $78 billion.
These riches, however, are a source of misery for the Papuan people, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful military preserves a strenuous presence.
A 2005 survey in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly US$20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papanian demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and detained by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua’s tribal highland in the 1970s became genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
Last year alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators.
"We'll lose everything" is said in a report by Archdiocese Brisbane from 2016, which contains reports of atrocities of the previous year, such as illegal executions and torture - rape and electric strikes are especially popular according to another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims as incidents occur every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have increased as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic trends are changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warning canteens sell fried chicken and gado gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting to keep up here.
"The migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who went to work in the provincial capital of Jayapura.
"It has cost the native Papua - the Mama-Mama [the women] of Papua - their market."
In 2014, Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, promised to address the inequalities and legal violations in Papua during his election campaign.
The former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua – including Paniai – on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
In fact, only two months after Jokowis' inauguration, Paniai suffered a low point in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were out there singing Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers attacked her tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk chased and beat the group with their rifle butts, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the children's group.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papuans, men, women, and children gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting arches and presented the Waita dance - in the circle running and an imitation bird song - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some demonstrators began to hurl stones at police and military posts.
When the mood was heated up, the soldiers were sent an order via an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," it is said in an official document by TIME, which was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayamae, 56, head of the Kego Koto quarter of Enarotali, saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I suddenly got shot in my left wrist," he said TIME on the porch of his colorfully painted wooden house.
Kayama still doesn't know who fired, but says that the bullet came out of the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
The local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, so his cousin, who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was," Yohanes said, who, like many Indonesians, has only a name, the TIME in a gloomy mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
The chief inspector of the Papua Police, Yotje Mende, said that his officers only wanted to "secure" their station because they were under attack.
"We need to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said Papua Police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many others injured.
The news of the killings came to Jakarta only on the following day.
Three weeks in Jayapura, Jokowi spoke passionately, expressing sympathy for the families of the victims and vowing to address the historical maladies in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately, so that it will no longer happen in the future," he said.
Minister of Security Wiranto said in October 2016 that he established an out-of-court mechanism for resolving historical human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
"Most injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to tackling these violations, but there are processes that need to be carried out," he said.
Then Wiranto withdrew when he spoke to TIME on 5 June in Jakarta and said he had no plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything is regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, who accused the UN of "crimes against humanity" calling for more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's 1999 bloody independence vote, said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been resolved in Papua, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai Sacrifices accepted such claims with gross infidelity.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress," Yohanes says.
"I'm tired."
He says he's still in fear years later.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, I'm afraid of being shot."
His brother Yacobus reiterated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military was looking for me," he says.
The shootings didn't stop.
On Tuesday the Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniais neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who was drowned when fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Emotional villagers protested in front of the company's location office.
The police said that the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killed one.
"We were so panicked, we're afraid there'll be revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and was witness to how the injured were quickly delivered here, says TIME.
"I hid two days in my house."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and for withdrawing the police's mobile brigades from the area.
Paniai was always a troublemaker for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the members of the tribe of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army, which claims to defend the rights of the Papua by inciting sporadic attacks and abductions of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top-OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, in recent years thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained, under the pretext of "security of national sovereignty".
Some never show up again.
Among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as "a more tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction.
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
People here are building everything they eat: especially nota and fruit and leaf vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of sweet potato each.
They keep the bulk of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of note cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have increased between the native Papuan and the new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to the Nabire airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and more wealthy migrants.
Papua rarely has the capital or the necessary skills to run its own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, chairman of the tribal council of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on the reporting of international media remain tense.
At the beginning of the year French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although they were granted rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowis election campaign to lift the restrictions on reporting in order to promote transparency and development were not realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's troubled easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa refusal and a black list," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread injuries" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
The spokesperson of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the group's allegations and said journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there is free media, so it is difficult to hide the evidence of human rights cases."
People on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by Kees Van Baar, a human rights ambassador, visited Jayapura on 4 May, locals broke their silence and threatened him "We want freedom", according to a source who also participated in the meeting but wants to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papuan people say that they will probably not vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shots," says Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor educational and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papuans, regard their voice for Jokowi as a "budget" he has to pay back.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out a last symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station.
They know that they may never receive justice, but at least they do not let the people responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with his head down.
"What else can we do?"
Fire capture the 'Torch' skyscraper from Dubai for the second time
A fire found its way through Dubai on Friday in one of the world's tallest residential towers and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337-metre-high 79-storey building.
It is the second fire that sweeps through the high house in just two years, which is by chance called the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the people's screams.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," said Reuters, a resident who gave his name as George.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said that the fire-fighting units destroyed the fire and cooled the building against 4:00 local time (00.00 GMT).
The government said that it is working on providing accommodation for those affected.
The incident can revitalise questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise homes around the world.
An investigation by the management of the torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from the disguise, exterior paneling for decoration or insulation.
In the UK, the police said that the system of plates for insulation and disguise on the London Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire, in which about 80 people died.
No Davis Cup Reform: Continue Best-of-Five
The President of the International Tennis Association (ITF) has passed through the General Assembly with his large Davis Cup coup.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup alone only on two winning sets was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The five sets classics, which are often very long, but also because of this, are very much appreciated, will thus remain in the tradition competition.
63.54 percent of the member countries voted in favour of the reform, so the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was almost missed.
"We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions," Haggerty said.
Work will continue to improve the application process.
It was not only the vote that had already come before the proposal that the finale should be held in a neutral place.
New from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details: This is how the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host law in the following year in the first round.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements in terms of training places etc. will be facilitated and players will have to complete less official media dates before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring prohibited items to the aircraft, finds out a survey
A survey of air passengers found that more than 20 percent deliberately or unconsciously prohibited items smuggled past the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6 percent that entered the aircraft while carrying accidentally prohibited knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 percent claimed that they had discovered late that they had gone accidentally with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers are more likely to ignore the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they have knowingly tried to fly with something forbidden by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared with less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items that were intentionally slid to TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted to carrying items with blade knowingly through security control, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had intentionally brought banned drugs into the aircraft.
The company said it asked travelers all over the country to find out how many accidentally smuggled things through airport security and how many would have done so intentionally.
It is no surprise that people who carry the closest contraband - knowingly or unknowingly - through security were those who fly most.
However, the company points out that the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure which liquids they may carry or how much of them.
It is no surprise, then, that the largest amount of liquids seized by the TSA are prohibited.
For a while people thought that TSA could view books as contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
Elon Musk Elon Musk is happy to give the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
He has so far suggested that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever triumphant figures on sales increases and even more huge sales targets, Tesla-Chief Elon Musk has for the first time announced the latest quarterly balance sheet with a different, less shiny number: the cancellation of the new mass market model 3.
In recent months Musk had often thrown the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery starts just now.
Musk now admits: Of the total 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In case of cancellation, Tesla will fully refund the $1000 (US$1000 and UK £1000) "reservation payment".
At present 455,000 such non-binding reservations were made, Musk cleared up a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the Tesla Chief does not believe that the cancellation of around twelve percent of all orders could become a problem until now.
His argument: The challenge of ambitious growth targets is not demand but production.
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018, all models were taken together - 500,000, in 2020 one million.
The demand for this is obvious.
According to Musk, reservations are currently being made per day 1800.
Those who today order a "Model 3" may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production routes, never tested in practice without major interruptions with maximum load.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are major delays, the non-bindingness of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent unsatisfied customers from running away in crowds.
EPO Chief Pruitt withdraws due to delaying the Obama Era rules to reduce emissions
One day after he was sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce the emissions of Smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved itself to be responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the case which had been brought against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appeal.
The deadline for countries to comply with the 2015 standards for soil-near ozone was 1 October.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "mixing himself into local decisions or hindering economic growth".
Pruitt, who was the prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment by President Donald Trump, was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations for a long time.
Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry oppose.
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPO administrator had exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his turnaround at ozone standards would simply strengthen the EPA's willingness to cooperate with the States through the complex process of timely meeting the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPO has often failed to comply with the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be sued by activist groups and others, and to set in agreement the date for implementation," said Pruitt, who sued the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in judicial regulation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the law and authority that exists for us."
Nevertheless, the EPO's opinion stated that Pruitt will eventually use its "power to delay and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the rules are "based on sound policy and the best available information".
The Republicans in Congress are pressing for a more comprehensive revision of the ozone rules.
A draft law approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of the states that had sued the EPO this week, said that the group intends to maintain the legal pressure.
"The return of the EPO - according to our complaints - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and those over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the Smog that flows into their communities," said Schneiderman.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone occurs when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The emerging smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people, and can contribute to thousands of premature deaths every year.
Public health representatives and environmentalists were cheering about a surprising change of course.
"It is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the responsible person for the protection of the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the ideological crusade of the Trump government to offer ourselves to polluters and their special interests".
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the Mountain Church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen is invited to a Serenade on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 p.m.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius site is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth benefittiz serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village made the friends and sponsors of Tumlingen their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It is a unique hamlet of smallness".
In 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the German documentary book: Count Hermann von Sulz "sold the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen and Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.
The text of the document was written on the Tumlinger mountain, besides the once parish church, also a grand court, to which the Church or Patronate law belonged and not vice versa.
So there were people living there.
As indicated by the description of the Upper Office of Freudenstadt of 1858, next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which can be seen today in the townscape of Tumlingen, was the "Berg" the third, the noble settlement core of the village.
Old maps from around the year 1600 underpin these historical conditions.
Patronat law was derived from the early medieval right of ownership of the Church.
A gentleman who built a church, equipped it and occupied it with a pastor remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this own church.
This was accompanied by the right to use a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The bigger of the two bursts on Christmas 1673.
The newly acquired bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but it had to be released later in World War II in 1942.
During the 30-year war (1616 to 1648), the windows were struck and the bell ropes were stolen.
The roof was ungrateful.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius-Friedhof also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilaris church was broken down.
Only the church tower was left standing.
On the New Year's Eve in 1834, a storm broke down the church tower and half collapsed.
In order to prevent an accident, the tower was cut off.
Only the tower Zwerg that still exists today was preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem from the "Schaffigen Reinners" as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn maintain the Hilarius plant.
As an organizer, the friends and sponsors invite Tumlingens on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth Serenade on the old cemetery to the St. Hilariuskapelle.
It is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with verbal contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
President Hartmut Romann speaks the closing word.
The programme will start at 4.30 p.m.
Admission is starting at 3.30 p.m.
To the Serenad, a roundabout takes place in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest", the organizers show fantastic views.
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to retain the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
The friends and sponsors of Tumlingens feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini affirms.
Verein wants to have windwheels approved
"Boisheim resists" sees no legal condition for construction and has therefore turned to the Land Council.
The association "Boisheim resists" has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was unlawful.
The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, since at the time in Viersen only at the city border to Schwalmtal there was a wind power concentration zone.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible, but at the same time the concentration zone excludes the use of wind energy for the rest of the city area.
These zones are intended to prevent a "salvation" of the landscape.
Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by changing the land use plan, the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved it due to a form error.
"Due to the lack of planning, the authorisation decision has still been unlawfully withdrawn and therefore has been granted," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of "Boisheim resists".
Current status of things: The City Council decided again before the summer break the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; the approval of the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "This means that the granting of an authorization for the construction of wind turbines is not legally excluded at this point."
The circle confirms the receipt of the request.
"The corresponding letters have been received in the district of Foursen since the last week," said one speaker.
The circle takes them to reconsider the matter.
However, they are not likely to lead to the procedure being stopped.
In view of ongoing proceedings at the administrative court on Thursday, the district did not wish to comment on the arguments of the association "Boisheim resists".
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build four 200 metres of wind wheels on an area on the Boisheim Nette.
Last year, the company in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved had concluded leases with the owner of the 65-hectare site.
With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11 400 households are to be met - which corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four households.
The NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersens City Council gave green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a participation in a wind power plant in Übach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg district.
Car and Tractor Cracking Together: Woman Dies in Horrible Accident
One terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning around 10 o'clock on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was fatally injured.
Two more people were slightly injured.
The country road remained blocked for hours.
According to police reports, a 17-year-old woman from Bornich and her car were accompanied by her 53-year-old mother, the L 333 in the direction of Bogel.
City and dealer planning "home shopping" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region should re-discover the shopping opportunities in the city center in September.
The business association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to lure the residents to the shopping mall in the city center.
As the president of the business association, Christian König, announced, the "home shopping" weekend should raise the awareness of the customers of the offers the city offers beyond the usual supermarket goods.
Thus, a market with regional suppliers is planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies should present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops in the city centre should be invited to "Mitternachts-Shoppen".
The action was not limited to residents of the city and the surrounding region.
In preparation are commercial spots on the radio, an Internet video and printed bags that point to the end of the campaign, says Christian König.
City administration and business associations cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce.
This will lead the commercial community and the city to another stage of the "Attractive city centre" project.
These include new offers such as the first "Active Day" at the Brunnenfest and sales-open Sunday, conversations with all traders and hosts to move them to active participation.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potentials should be re-opened or re-opened.
These include spas and tourists.
But many locals too would have lost sight of the city center when shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to contribute to reviving the city center - to landlords, to the businesses of the entire city and associations.
It was necessary to overcome with a network the lethargy that had partially spread, King had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, director of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen, announced that he was taking part in the nationwide third "Home Shopping Day" for the first time in five Thuringian cities.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day was to "promote for the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance for the common good of our cities," says Streich.
The action under the direction of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his or her direct environment with his or her buying behaviour.
Two dead and several injured after explosion to US school
During construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New other people were injured.
In a gas explosion in Minneapolis City, two people were killed and nine others injured, some of them heavy.
According to the fire brigade, on Wednesday (local time) another injured person was in critical condition.
A human being died when part of a school building collapsed in the explosion.
An initial missing person was also saved to death later.
The dead were employees of the school.
As a consequence, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
At the time of the holiday, only a few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump put pressure on Mexico after leaked transcripts of telephone calls due to the payment of the border wall
Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called on the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The U.S. president insulted him because he publicly attacked the wall. According to reports, he said to him, "You can't tell the press that."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States, and vowed to have Mexico pay for the project.
Transscripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the US refugees who emigrated to Australia was to assume "stupid", "mies" and "dum" and that the existence on the trade that was conveyed by Obama's government would make him look like a "deep" after he had proposed a ban on the relocation of refugees to the US.
Mr. Trump finished the call after he said Mr. Turnbull, "that's the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists reopen racist Lynchakt as a call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and bumped into Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver could reach the bridge, a group of white men with rifles emerged to block his path.
The mob's leader - a middle-aged man in a needle stripe suit - took a long train on his cigar and looked at the windshield.
Inside, the inmates were floating in fear.
"We want this n----r Roger!" the man roared.
"Get him out of the car!"
Shouts torn the silence when a young black man was torn from the passenger seat.
Luckily, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22, is just an imitation.
But when a sling is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone in the audience was really sighing.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were ridiculed by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one was ever charged with the murder.
"It is really incredible that in all these years no one person was arrested - even though we see them in our communities, although we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who is helping to organize the imitation.
"It's a dirty spot on a story, but it's a burden for our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the state of Georgia and a lifelong citizen's lawyer.
For him, the imitation serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want punishment, we want the end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need justice," he said.
"We can't get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
One of the victims of the Moore Ford Lynchen on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI acts received by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching process.
But no one was ever charged.
Although suspects have been on the loose for decades, citizens' rights say that the double motivation for Lynch actions throughout the city was always known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision by the Supreme Court allowed the black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in the pre-election campaign in the summer.
About the same time as the election, according to the FBI, a white landowner, Barnett Hester, was found by the black farmer Roger Malcom, allegedly downing a battle for a woman.
Brooks said the rumors in the city were that Hester slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she wore didn't come from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, says the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
But when they left the prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murder," concludes an FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a plot between the state and local prosecution, which not only involved in the murders, removed evidence and obscured the identity of witnesses."
Brooks puts it even more concisely.
"It was an electoral massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you can register and if you vote, then this will happen to you here."
For almost a decade Cassandra Greene has led the annual re-enactment of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murder.
Her presentation is vivid, catchy and is based in a kind of deep racism many would like to believe that he no longer exists in America.
It's hard to look, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lynching because we're then confronted with its uglyness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've been through."
The samples for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest of blacks - pushed into a room and listened when Greene started a well-recorded overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is Greenes co-director.
He's been playing the role of chief clan member for years, but he said the role will never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to return to these times."
On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The play begins with Malcom, who screams at the horse and oppresses him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n--he, get off my property!"
Rascona returns fire.
There's a break.
And then each (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs loudest.
"What?", asked Rascona.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still looking.
"I just don't think that white people would say "a--he" at the time."
"But," whizzed one of the other black actors.
"You just have to hit the hard 'R.'."
And right there the energy shifts in space, a feeling of camaraderie replaces discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N word, he says it sharply and emphatically.
Absolutely no one's laughing.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman, dressed in a wedding dress, stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holiday's grieving Lobrede "Strange Fruit".
Their voice breaks in every other word.
About a hundred meters behind it, a group of about four dozen spectators wade sweat and tears out of their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple have come from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many just come down the street.
They have experienced almost eight hours of moisture from Georgia when Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to Malcoms and Dorsey's tombs.
Until this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when you stand on the same country where the Lynch murder took place, the air feels spooky.
When the last notes of the song stop, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body names.
Children cling to their heads, register the falsified blood and the still bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," murmurs a little boy as if he wanted to remember.
After a few minutes of thanking Greene the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the Lynch rope and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then breaks together in her arms crying, and finally the emotional burden of the performance breaks through him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispers.
"We know that this is not in your heart.
You did this for a reason."
Later, the audience meets with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta chattered about the imitation with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that left behind the feeling of performance.
"It's hard to hear these horrible words and deeds... from people who look like you and who do that because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does to me makes me think that the lynching is still going on," she added, "now it's just called police shooting."
In the same area, Tyrone Brooks Hof holds his table, eats and reminds of citizens' rights.
He said he's already started planning the performance next year.
"The imitation is in a way inspiring, for it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's true if we don't learn from it, then it can happen again.
Whoever does not study his own story, who does not know his own story, is doomed to repeat it."
The Wagnerians reconciled in Bayreuth
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf also puts on a colorful, frivolous production in front of a gigantic six-storey setting.
The filming stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows a rough street corner, along with the remains of the wall and the shops in Berlin, a "Plaste and Elaste" logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes-Oldtimer parked in which the Rheindöchter pose as rocker girls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels remind of Castorf's leitmotiv - money, power and greed - which draws through his "ring" production.
The three Rheindöchter - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - are wonderfully harmonious as already in the "Rheingold".
Kess seduces Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), divides a body into the trunk in Hollywood manner and gives the Krawallo-Clique.
Stephen Milling sings the gorgeous ugly hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavy-weight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he beat Siegfried.
Gunther (Markus Eiche) must also believe in it later.
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who modestly and bowing their hands to the Merkel-Raute, are celebrated in a stormy atmosphere.
There is great applause for the festival orchestra, which shows up on stage for the first time – in the face of the great heat again in the army of leisure clothing.
The appearance of Frank Castorf and his team of directors had been expected with excitement.
If he had to have a valid pipe concert over himself in 2013, five years later there was great joy in which the single "buh" calls went down.
Festival manager Katharina Wagner may have enjoyed it.
"One realizes that the audience has grown together with the "ring" in a way," she had said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience had not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it had also grown in understanding of its view.
I'm drawing a positive summary.
Max Quantity works as a volunteer
They work in several places in their volunteer year.
Where else?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I've been working at school all day, too.
What are your experiences with this?
Lots: It's a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I'm dealing with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You're now 26 years old, so you're a late volunteer.
How's that coming?
Quantity: I've done my Abitur.
And then a construction engineer study, let's say, ended successfully.
I realized for myself that it's the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else, work with people.
And then I asked myself, what are you doing?
Make a social year, there's an insight, you can see how it's on the ground, in the focus maybe, really is.
And was it like that?
Quantity: I have collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in social work in the winter semester.
I will study dual, probably in the Youth Office Herne a social worker training and study in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.
Is it not unusual to have several different places of employment during volunteering?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
I guess it always depends on where to make your FSJ.
You can do it from the old age home to the youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also part of the OGS, i.e. in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly what irritated me.
I could see my own strengths and see how it really goes.
Unlike in engineering studies?
Quantity: Well, this is not about calculating statistics.
You always have other people like heads, each with a completely different story behind you.
Whether a refugee, whether a youth who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have any fear of contact?
A lot: I'm not the guy for that.
It's an area that gives you a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are sometimes negative moments, but that's how life is.
Pearson reduces another 3,000 jobs and shortens the dividend to revive the business
The British education group Pearson said on Friday that it will reduce an additional 3,000 jobs and reduce its intermediate dividend by 72 percent, as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure faced by the company.
In addition to its previous restructuring, which already lost 4,000 jobs, the job reduction announced mainly by Director-General John Fallon at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019.
In May, Pearson announced in a third cost reduction programme a cost reduction plan of a further £300 million (394 million) to revive a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning.
The company, which had divested its stake in Penguin Random House in Partner Bertelsmann last month, said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after it had increased from 1 percent to 2,05 billion pounds in the first half of the year.
Convoi attack by Kabul: Nato soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed a NATO soldier, and wounded several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and one interpreter were injured, told a NATO statement.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians died during the incident in the Qarabagh district.
Bombardment is the last act of violence that Afghanistan has taken this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Heat.
On Monday, a suicide killer killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
NATO's statement says that the explosion happened on Thursday night when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "improvised set of persons" carried.
The statement states that all the injured are in a stable condition and are treated in the US military hospital at the Bagram airport.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for the NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which about 20% were in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out this attack.
On May 31st, a massive bombing in the city center killed more than 150 people with the country's most deadly militant attack, since the US-led troops in 2001 displaced the Taliban from power.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, since U.S. President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that in recent weeks the suicide attacks in Kabul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policy and, in particular, in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPO implements decision to delay the Smog rule after actions
The US Environmental Protection Authority has taken a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama Government, which obliges States to contain Smog-causing emissions, which took place one day after 15 states sued the Agency for the step.
The EPA announced late Wednesday's decision to advance the so-called "zone regulations 2015" and said that it was showing the agency's commitment to cooperate with states.
"We believe in dialogue with and on that we respond to our state partners," said EPO Chief Scott Pruitt in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June the EPO's intention to postpone the measurement of ozone regulations in a part of the country's pollutant emissions in order to determine where cuts need to be made in order to comply with stricter air quality standards by one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, together with the Colombian district, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.
The government of President Donald Trump has tried to reverse a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda to boost economic growth according to Trump.
However, efforts have triggered the setback of democrats and nature conservation groups, which are concerned about the impact of higher emissions on public health.
The EPO's website says that inhaling air that contains ozone "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
Community Council wants Community
In the end, the decision was clear: in two votes against, the Municipal Council of Fluorn-Winzeln decided to set up a Community space in the future old-age housing facility.
Before the discussion, there is an important information: The purchase contract for the missing part of the property was signed, says Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will still take until the area belonging to the church community is in municipal ownership, there is no longer any planning obstacle for the project to be voted by a private investor.
There is a discussion on this subject concerning a Community area.
One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, he would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council are hovering before providing such a common space as a meeting place not only for the residents of the senior dwelling, but openly into the community.
As an example, the word of the "Strickcafé" made the round.
The decision made by the provision of appropriations for the current budget in the last autumn will be welcomed by means of support.
The building is located in the refurbishment area.
The establishment of a Community area would be eligible, says Tjaden, with 60 percent of 30 percent.
The proposal for a decision, in order to signal the investor that he does not want to be confused in this respect, provides for the conclusion that both saddles - which is based on the surrounding area - and pult roof - which would reduce the level of traffic and make it more economical - would be possible.
Needless to say, Wilfried Sohmer does not just mean that he is.
If it helps, he acts unanimously in the panel.
It is not that simple in the Community area.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many private buildings with which one does not get along quite properly, for which one now leans out of the window at the common space, she says, "I'm having a hard time doing it".
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the Community area - but absolutely against a municipal participation.
It sees behind it a hidden subsidy to any wealth or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because the acquisition of the area does not give rise to subsidies, but rather to a real marketable equivalent in the event of doubt, is the opposite.
There are three supporters of Staiger's request to split the proposed decision accordingly.
Thus, two votes remain in the original programme, which Stefan Haller sums up in this way: "If we make the decision in this way, we make a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure".
Collision by car: Wheelers are thrown on the road
On Wednesday, an 82-year-old cyclist in Garath was picked up by a car and seriously injured.
As the police reported, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been on the road from Hilden on his bicycle at 12.20 p.m.
The senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the street Am Buchholzer Busch.
He was given priority by a car driver in the same direction.
When the Langenfelder drove on the road, however, he apparently did not pay attention to the counter-trafficking.
He met with a car that controlled a 66-year-old Hildener.
The man was dragged to the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital by a sleeper.
FC Bayern Munich has to refrain from David Alba and Thiago from the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup takes place without it: David Alabama must have the game sauntered against Dortmund.
FC Bayern travels to Dortmund with staff care for the first compulsory play of the new season.
Seven professionals are missing the champion in the Supercup against the Cup winner.
The personnel services at the German football record champion Bayern Munich are getting bigger and bigger before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30/ZDF and Eurosport) at Pokalsieger Borussia Dortmund.
In duel with the BVB, coach Carlo Ancelotti must also dispense with David Alaba.
This was confirmed by the Italians on Friday.
In addition, Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
For the five defeats in the last six test games, Ancelotti has made the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team.
"We know that we are not in the best physical condition," said Ancelotti and added: "The most important point is the balance in the team.
It wasn't good at last."
The 58-year-old, however, believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, expecting a "quiet, intense game".
The duel of the two German football weights attracts the fans.
The game is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Walking in the Harz from star to star
In the Harz, the first "star path" is created throughout Germany.
The association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg plans this.
There is a planet trail in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star path" meets the information needs of many resin visitors, it said.
He combined nature, science, movement and sporting performance.
Members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "well-reachable installations in five to six locations" in the Oberharz.
St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber would be questioned.
The information on the panels is to be supplemented by the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network reception plays a role in site selection.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later the Star Path train is to be extended by train.
"The viewers learn a lot about the physics of the individual stars on the Star Path," said the association.
In addition, they learned why stars have different colors or why one star shines stronger than another, although it is much further away.
It is also indicated in which constellation is a selected star and when it is best to see it.
Since 2014, the association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg the highest-class observatory in northern Germany.
The site in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation.
Often from there, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda-Galaxie with the naked eye can be clearly seen.
Since 2003, there has been something similar in the university since 2003 on the initiative of the funding association Planetarium Göttingen.
Starting before Gebhard's hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planet's path leads with its stilts up to the Hainberg and the Observatory - as well as an "extraterrestrial" location in Diemarden (Gemeinde Einfachen) with the planet Sedna.
The stilts with the individual planets - including the Pluto degraded to the dwarf planet at the end point - are exactly positioned at the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimetres in diameter, while the sun, exactly 75 metres away, at least measures 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planet's path is well four kilometers.
While the light from the sun to the Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to steal with Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in the universe.
The march to the next fix star but would take another half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lozunko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lofakenko and Mikey Garcia, who were supposed to be in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing campaign in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council Lightweight Champion, went down the hall to welcome Lozuenko, the World Boxing Organization Super-Federal Weight Champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision on the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pounds-for-pound list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How are you, champ?
I wish you good luck."
Lozuenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 7pm on ESPN.
When the couple posed for photos, Lozunko-Manager Egi's climates noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect magnitude".
"I'm a former springweight," Garcia recalled.
"I've risen for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down to light weight.
And he has to move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans demand.
Let's give it to them."
Loaningko agreed.
"Boxes need this fight."
Climate asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lofinenko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year in order to agree a date with Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 Knockouts) who also has an interest in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight in the Forum on 23 September.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all fans asked for it," said Garcia and later openly expressed themselves to fight in the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready ... "
Garcia said he thought Lozuenko was "a huge fighter," and he might be participating in his Saturday fight.
But Lofakenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thought that the three-combat champion from Riverside looks very slow, I'm sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-out.
Garcia said that the focus was to show stroke strength, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum building up for their own struggle.
"This is the fight that must be carried out.
No other battle creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I am more than happy to work on it," said Garcia.
Lozuenko said, "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It will be a great fight."
Four Victims After Tires
In an accident on the A7 four people were severely injured on Thursday afternoon.
After the first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at 4:30 p.m. shortly before the terminal market was completed.
The car slid to the right into the villain, where he crossed over and then remained on the roof in the green stripe.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident.
During the first supply of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was blocked towards the north for about one hour, and then the traffic on the left lane could be passed at the site of the accident.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Three chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2:2 to the start of the season against Braunschweig that the optimization of defense formation will bring points to Aue.
Andre Hoffmann was also satisfied with the result of the first season, since the two opponents would not have been at 2:2 against Braunschweig.
"That was two counter-gates too much, and we have to look even better in Aue," says Fortuna Düsseldorf defense player.
In the Erzgebirge, the tributary chain is to be further optimised.
And a gate after a free shot the Fortunes no longer want to catch themselves.
"For the future, it will be that no one stands on the line any more beside Michael (Rensing).
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will do better after the experience in the preparation with the tricycle than with the four-chain.
"Now I don't know how we're going to act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his thing, "because we have players who can build well right in the three-chain on the half-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gißelmann," Hoffmann said.
"The prerequisite is that we harmonize even better and we do not make so many mistakes in construction."
Of course Hoffmann also drives to Aue to win the game.
"If, however, one can speak of a failed start after a decision is made, don't know.
The performance could be quite okay," Hoffmann said.
"But if we stand there on Sunday with four points and can focus on the Cup, we will certainly be able to talk about a proper start of the season."
His coach didn't want to know about that.
"I don't judge the start of the season until after six to eight days of play," said Friedhelm Funkel, who doesn't want to talk about an advantage to Aue, just because the game of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be stopped prematurely because of an storm.
"Now they can start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann, believing that the players from Aue might even be a bit fresher, since they don't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an ascent favorite in the bones.
"But they don't know exactly where they are at the moment," says the internal defender of Fortuna.
Although the guests from the Rhineland as a lighter favorite go to the final (almost) finished stadium of Aue on Sunday.
"The fact that we're taking them away is because we're entitled to get under the first six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose record is quite positive in only one defeat against the Aue in nine games.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga to strike from the front," explains Fortuna's chief coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant".
And so Funkel doesn't want to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of the Swedish Asylumalter evaluation tests published
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the persons tested are older than 18 years old. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Legal Medical Agency) has begun carrying out the tests last year.
During the asylum procedure, they should make the assessment of age more accurate after the Swedish Migration Authority (Migrationsverket) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage.
To date, the Migration Agency has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years of age or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under 18 years old".
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is called into question.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been stable over the past few months.
"We don't see a big difference in the statistics of recent months, the numbers are pretty constant," he said in The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases in which the person has been assessed as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the applicant has lied about his age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that "suggest that the person studied was 18 years of age or older".
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays are made of wisdom teeth and MRI recordings of knee beds, which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.
A skeptic is Endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of humans to see whether they were going through puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the kind of measurement should be used.
To judge biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say for sure, we shouldn't pretend we could," he said to the newspaper Metro.
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of misjudgeting a child as an adult is low.
The greatest risk is if the person is just under 18, in this case this is about 10 percent."
Full plan
The works on the three bridges of the 108 motorway between Lauterbach and Schramberg are well advanced.
On Wednesday, a seven-tonne concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We're very good at the time, it's going great," says Reinhold Lighticht, head of construction at the Road and Transport Department in the government Bureau of Freiburg.
In April the works started simultaneously on all three bridges that needed renovation between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The building end is planned for October and it is easy to ensure that the timetable is respected.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a concrete arched arc bridge, lined with red colored sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over Lauterbach.
They are made of red bunt sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, or 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the Lauterbach entrance has now received on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1,30-metre wide and seven-tonne bridge cap.
This is an edge fastening, which is also used as the operating path.
On the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 metre wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday.
Then the pedestrian's path is to follow it.
The special thing about this is that it is a finished part, a patent of Schramberger's company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps.
Special feeling of fingertips has required the laying of lines through the construction work in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a fiber optic cable that many companies are connected to.
In the run-up to the work, the residents were informed about the project by means of a handbill.
In addition, fish and crabs had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the Bauhof Building and the Collective Weiher in the direction of Schramberg, the traffic is intermittently regulated by a traffic light.
For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is fully locked.
The cost of the three bridge renovations is EUR 700 000.
The whole thing is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bunter protest with German potato salad
It does not happen so often that parties draw on one strand, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which otherwise is difficult to put under one hat.
The parties represented in the District Day of Vulkaneifel (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, Left) are part of a broad alliance, which shows peaceful flag on this day, because the AfD in the Gerolstein City Hall of Rondell invites to the poster according to the "great campaign of campaigning".
And well-known names are launched - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland is the leading duo for the Bundestag elections on 24 September, and the vice-president Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are already hours before the start of the event on the spot do not want to listen to the AfD students, but demonstrate.
The motto "Die Eifel remains colorful".
Originally, the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at one table" on the fountain square, but now takes place in the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the town hall.
A colorful picture that offers itself there.
And what Christa Karoli, Chairman of the Forums A world and one of the relevant organizers, is really happy: "Great how many people have gathered here".
There is music and a lot of food, including a "UrGerman potato salad that the AfD could eat without any problems," says the woman who brought him.
The police ordered a lot of officials to Gerolstein, and it also shows presence at the station, which is only a few meters away from the venues.
How did the AfD actually get to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reported that he had tried to get such an event and got the hit.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked for parking in Daun, but got a cancellation there, because due to the already built Laurentiuskirmes there were not enough parking spaces.
So the Rondell, Hopes is happy that "we can have such a beautiful event here".
Looking at the event on the roundabout, he says: "This is the good right of people, the main thing, it remains peaceful".
That's what it does too: around 20 o'clock there's a band in the roundabout, in the town hall there are various speakers, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD president Uwe Junge.
In the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the leading candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the deputy chairman Beatrix von Storch to hold their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officials had a quiet evening.
The AfD event takes a bit more than an hour, the guests on the premises have a longer breath, but also there is a quick tidy up after 21 o'clock.
The police can cancel - no special incidents.
Posaune Meets Trumpet
Listening to the Wolfacher Posaunist Frederic Belli will be held in the Haslacher Klosterkonzerte series tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 pm in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or "Balkanfolklore" also meets a classical German education with roots in bladder music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in top European orchestras.
Petkov is the solo trumpeter at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is the solo player of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross the limits on their instruments but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
This is how Johann Sebastian Bach sounds at the two of them as in a new robe, Daniel Schnyder's "World Music" combines with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by Jazzecho prizewinner Nils Wogram, classical music, jazz and free play mix into a fascinating overall work of art.
This core part of the programme was only premiered this spring with enormous success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more: The Haslacher Klosterkirche with its special acoustics is deliberately included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything out," said Kristen Stewart openly about her bisexuality.
"When I bite in grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh that was cool, what's next?'."
The Hollywood star's most famous relationship was that of her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who eventually became bitter.
Despite all of this, the brunette actress assures the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was seriously in love with every person I've dated.
Or do you think I've played it?"
After her separation, Christians admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived and seriously believed in dualism.
So it has never confused or hindered me.
I just never liked not being taken seriously."
Especially among them she suffered according to "Bang Showbiz" but in school time when she preferred to dress like a bull: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I'd look like a bull.
I felt really attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and think to myself, 'Mother, be proud of you!'"
Especially the public does not like to explain their love life: "People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me.
And maybe some call me ungrateful, but I don't like to have to justify myself in front of the public."
The Governor of West Virginia announces that he will change the party
. The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced on Thursday evening at a rally with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have removed themselves from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and many thoughts ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor."
The rally broke out in jubilation.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to Republicans," Justice added.
"As a trainer, I would say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve of the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and has inherited coal from his father.
It's worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, on Thursday evening, the Republican National Committee made a statement saying, "The change of the party of Governor Justice is another blow to a democratic party that would rather hinder us than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governors and the control of the least legislative agencies in history, the announcement by Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive, unanimous message," said RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel in a statement to CBS News.
Coe praises "honorous" Russian excuse for doping scandal
The global head of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be reintroduced into sports.
Russia's Athletics Chief Dmitry Shylahtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the Athletics World Championships that his country's banishment from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight the doping.
He said he was sorry for "all the athletes who were snatched away gold and silver medals in competitions".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-funded doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to the reporters.
"The entire council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation recognized in itself that it has experienced some quite hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is reorganized."
Coe said he was also "happy" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think that progress has been made, but Congress supports the Task Force's recommendations that this is not the time to start Russia again," Coe said.
"We will have to do everything we can to normalize this situation in the next few months.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will act as neutral players at the World Athletics Championships, which start on Friday in London, following the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for a reinstatement.
Drug testing was still insufficient and banned trainers were still free to work, he said reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Sacrifice for soldiers crashed in Mali
At a funeral in the North Hessian Fritzlar, about 1,000 people thought of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place in the Domstadt on Thursday under high security precautions.
For the still unexplained cause of the crash, Minister of Defense Ursula of the Leyen (CDU) said nothing.
She referred to the two killed pilots as "the master of their profession".
"We are humiliating ourselves from the highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she said.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Chief of Staff from North Hessen had died on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Mali.
Their sages were transferred to Germany and brought to Fritzlarer Dom Sankt Peter on Thursday accompanied by a death watch from the Bundeswehr.
At noon, only the members of the church initially resigned.
Afterwards the celebration began in the circle of the family, closest friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr as well as politics.
Among these were Hessen's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the general inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
The mourners lowered roses, and the relatives stood in their arms on the sares.
In front of the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers persecuted the ceremony on a canvas.
The Secretary of Defense of the Leyen called the dead soldiers "decorated high" and exploits.
The chief of staff had built Tiger's fighter helicopter in Fritzlar and was one of the first six tiger pilots trained in his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment, to whom the soldiers belong, also stated: "If this crew could not stop the crash, no one would have been able to do so".
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show the minister of the Leyen: the use was dangerous.
But he was also of great importance "for a country from which we are separated only by two states," she said.
After the funeral, the wounds were taken from the cathedral.
When and where they are buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife.
The man of the Danish queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), will not be buried next to his wife after his death.
This was announced by the royal house on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is buried in Roskilde Cathedral.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already completed a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed to her husband's decision, so it was further stated in the communication.
Where Prince Henrik is buried is still unclear.
But he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a noise that he was not happy with his title.
After the accession of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would have liked to be king.
In 2016 he retired and also gave the title "Prinzgemahl".
Since Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he does not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death, Lene Balleby, the chief spokesman of the Danish royal house.
Where the last resting-place of the 83-year-old will ultimately be, be unclear.
But he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country for which he has worked in the last 50 years.
The native Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, the son of a French noble family, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked at the Thames in the French Embassy.
During his later wife's sympathy with the people always prevailed, Prince Henrik had a difficult standing in his almost 50-year reign with the Danes.
In an autobiography Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was swaying, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk skirts instead of knit socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises, which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and which in this country had the reputation to be the brand of socio-critical intellectuals, I could not hope for forbearance.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed.
That was just two mistakes!"
Prime Minister Weil wants rapid re-election
CDU and FDP before a possible majority in Lower Saxony
Niedersachsen's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is, after losing the red-green government majority for a rapid re-election of the Landtag, but he does not want to resign.
Because on Friday we spoke about Parliament's dissolution.
Previously, the surprising withdrawal of a Green Member from her Landtag faction in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a severe crisis.
Five months before the official election date, the Red-Green Coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-step majority in Parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
Elke Twesten, a former member of the Green Party, justified her step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she explained on Friday in Hanover.
CDU Group President Björn Thumler would like to recommend to his group that they be included.
Thus, CDU and FDP had 69 seats in the Landtag of Lower Saxony, SPD and Green 68 seats.
So far, the relationship was reversed.
The new Landtag will be elected on regular January 14th next year.
Thümler said that the red-green state government had to decide now whether it could continue to rule in this situation without a majority.
Stephan Weil, however, believes it essential that the land day decide its self-resolution as quickly as possible.
The CDU faction is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday.
The Constitution also provides for the possibility of the Landtag withdrawing the confidence of the Prime Minister and choosing a successor.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities need to be assessed legally, "Thümler said.
"You will be able to discuss all the questions in peace if they have been properly examined."
Thümler called Twesten's step "a bit of a kurios".
The politician herself stressed: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good".
She called herself a follower of black-green.
The Greens called on the retired Members to return their country's mandate.
"We assume, of course, that she will return her country-day mandate, which she has received on the green country list, with immediate effect," said Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
The Group president of the Green Anja Piel said: "We very much regret the decision of Elke Twesten".
She has deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the group.
"Even against the background that there were no substantive differences, we cannot understand this step."
SPD chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condemns the violation of the Low Saxon Green MEPs Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The behaviour of former Green Members in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of voters, but also betrayal of Red-Green," wrote the head of the Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook.
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to have the Landtag re-elect quickly.
The exit of Twestens costs the majority in Red-Green in Lower Saxony.
The politician "put her personal interests ahead of the country's well-being in her injured vanity and in her frustration," criticised SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU participates in this dirty intrigue game in Lower Saxony and tries to beat political capital out of it."
Mr. Niedersachsen's Head of CDU Group Björn Thümler would like to recommend that his MP include Elke Twesten into the CDU.
The head of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of distorting the outcome of the 2013 Landtag election with personal career thinking.
The CDU was at the time the strongest force before the SPD, but SPD and Greens had a very thin majority of one vote in the Landtag.
Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisoning, Mr Schmidt?
Germany discusses contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is interviewed with the editorial network Germany (RND) and answers.
Mr Schmidt, how can the consumer protect himself from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp print.
On the Consumer Protection Portal www.Food Warning.de, the federal states use the latest information on the eggs in question.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to what we know at present, a health hazard is virtually excluded.
Is Aldi now taking over the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the supply - because the central role of the informer is not really perceived by the Federal Minister for Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the task of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house has immediately opened up and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since becoming aware of Germany's concern.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Trade, as well as manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are safe and safe from health.
If the maximum residue level of 0,005mg/kg has been exceeded in eggs, it is not transportable.
Unblasted eggs, however, can be sold and consumed.
This time, businesses are not to blame.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to current knowledge, the production companies are not directly liable.
Rather, they have to expect economic damage due to the alleged illegal practices of service companies.
As always, there are too few controllers in serious cases.
Is there a shortage of staff or the ultimate responsibility?
It was the official controls that have revealed the process.
The truth is, however, that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded at 100 percent.
This is precisely why a consistent clarification of such events and the surrender to the prosecutions in cases where crimes may occur are of crucial importance.
I have already made it clear several times that I expect the responsible authorities to provide a comprehensive information.
Is regular alertism really necessary in food scandals?
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and portable food.
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightfully upset.
The money spent has put manufacturers, dealers and consumers in a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
Basically, it must be clear: the illegal use of the insecticide Fipronil in keeping food-producing animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to know the facts quickly and incessantly.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the unhindered expenditure of European football clubs will not interfere with Neymar's world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris Saint Germain.
Some consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, because the leading organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions-League tournament.
Financial fair-play rules introduced by the UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG has to prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilians out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly ease the money to sign Neymar and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the powerful family of rulers of Qatar.
Clubs may spend a lot of money on the purchase of players, but must counter with legitimate sources of revenue that allow them to break-even point in their football-related business.
The FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had taken on huge debts in their pursuit of success effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from concentration on the debts of the clubs to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a harder matter.
During the current three-year FFP construction period, which runs until 2018, Clubs can take losses of 30 million euros.
And although Platini has fallen into disrepute with the Presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to strive to deter excessive spending.
"FFP is certainly not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at the UEFA, in relation to The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid Neymar's buy-out clause in a package, it can distribute the billing amount over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the redemption sum for the next five years of EUR 44.4 million can be shown in the annual accounts.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, the PSG has met with the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars) which was later lowered to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014/15 season Champions League remain limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outsmart their financial supervision by blowing up their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club.
While a catarian company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship exceeded the standard market rates, the UEFA would not allow this to be considered legitimate income.
That is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of PSA sponsorship was blown up by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar about payments made by the World Cup Organisational Committee 2022.
But PSG and Qatar in 2022 have argued that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors and such a maneuver could be easy for UEFA regulators.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to observe any attempt to circumvent the rules.
The UEFA had no preparatory discussions with PSG about Neymar's transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.
They talked to The Associated Press under the terms of anonymity, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The last published reports show that PSG 2015/16 achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million with sales of EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after signing.
The Spanish league was clearly annoyed to see one of the best footballers going, and she tried to prevent Neymar's withdrawal by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
"It is a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and the state," said the President of La Liga, Javier Tebas, Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's last ownership of PSG.
Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is owned by an American sports Tycoon, shares La Liga's reservation against a state that finances an association.
"It is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"As soon as a country has an association, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect the Financial Fairplay because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new Shoggi Supplier
In recent years, Chocolate Frey has produced board chocolate for the Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is at a possible end: the airline is rewriting the contract.
Swiss spokesman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request by the news agency sda an appropriate report of the newspaper "Northwest Switzerland" of Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be reviewed every two to three years and quality control would be carried out.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolate Frey," said the spokesperson.
Around 17 million small red-white, packed shoggi boards distribute 14 grams per year the flight attendants before landing to the passengers.
The Swiss did not want to give any information about the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Northwest Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros daughter achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion francs.
But all the important thing is the advertising effect: for a shoemaker, it is a prestigious order.
How many applicants there are in the new tender does the Swiss not want to betray.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolate Frey wants to try to renew the contract beyond the spring of 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion.
Chocolate boards have been distributing Swiss flights on board since 2006.
Before the Swiss signed a contract with Migro's daughter, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug.
The possibility of placing the logo was introduced two and a half years ago by Swiss with the start of the collaboration with Chocolate Frey.
The airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-distance flights, customers of the First Class are spoiled with delicacies by the Confiserie Sprüngli, in the Business Class wet passengers Schoggi by Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi by Chocolate Frey.
Swiss Schoggi is also distributed on the short track by Chocolate Frey, both in the business and in the Economy Class.
Athletics - Discus Olympiar Robert Harting reaches World Cup finals
The three-time world champion fights for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, Olympic champion of 2016, failed in the national World Cup election and was only able to watch the discus competition from the Tribune.
With the first attempt, the Polish defender Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters far, qualified for the final battle.
Nostalgia goes into the niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90-year grunge era (when the thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter shot the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By sticking to the core of the Gag - actors of middle age playing great children who will grow up - they still made it impossible to win back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with its adults who now play adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the casting cannon principle, including a reef on the Stalker films of the 90s like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand that rocks the cradle").
At one point, an Apple powerbook, some in-line cases and "a number of other things from 1991" stows a character.
Many of the central stories are the same.
The lovely Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Roman author, has not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there's another crazy-wrong plot included in Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's lips from "Singles", whose former Big Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It's the moments of random madness that could heat this franchise like a kind of repeating "Seven Up!" series until he reaches what I'm assuming as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene will show the bands how they're going to attend the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its east-to-west ring-fighting iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director indicates to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two police as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - a hard-storied Gregory and an idealist Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronised by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice Gags to watch (the police spend the time watching chess on television, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - ensures a decent game 'Find out the Voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer who wears a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like one.
At six long episodes it pulls away, and the comedy is not fast or often enough.
"Comrade Detective", edited to a lesser length, could deliver his agitprop satire better, as Gregor and Iosef continue to visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of Hamburgers.
The message for the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a food for a living.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own younger history and with their own.
Beating Drug Mafia in the Country
The police have succeeded in beating the Italian Mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning many objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as Konstanz's prosecutors announced on Friday.
At the age of 25 to 77, 15 accused were arrested and already issued arrest warrants against them.
In addition, the officials secured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested in Italy at the same time.
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspect Italians.
The two are therefore likely to be delivered to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
In total, more than 300 policemen were in use.
The Mafia members are charged with organized drug crime, serious violence, attempted murder and robbery and extortion.
Since summer 2016, the prosecutors have already identified Konstanz against organized drug trafficking in the South German region.
Between the public prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, on Wednesday morning, the large operation was accompanied by four officials from Palermo.
In particular, Italian nationals with a close reference to the Italian Mafia went to visit the investigation.
Also an incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired in a restaurant early in the morning, should go to the account of the gangs.
How lamented major gaps in the foreign register
"Data from citizens who should not appear": According to a report, the foreign registry in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to some serious misdecisions in the case of asylum proceedings.
According to a media report, the Federal Government's refugee management officer Frank-Jürgen Wies drew attention to large gaps in the central register of foreigners.
Failures in the data recorded there could lead to "partial grave misdecisions" in asylum procedures and deportations, warned manner in an analysis of the "South German newspaper".
According to the register, 10 million people with foreign nationality are recorded, including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data are then managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been properly maintained, data quality has not been good in parts so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 had been found, "by people who are not alive for the long time, or by citizens who have become German citizens and should actually no longer appear in the register".
"Faulty data input can significantly slow back processes," the report continues.
Moreover, the statistics on people leaving the country included EU citizens who would not have to leave at all.
However, such misrepresentations led to "a distorted debate on dealing with those on leave," according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the Federal Government has apparently begun sending refugee families back to Italy with under 16-year-old children when they have come from there.
This is highlighted by an internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung".
According to the paper, the BAMF has carried out such procedures "on families with children - with the exception of infants and young children - back to Italy since 1 June 2017.
Since the end of 2014, this was practically impossible, according to the newspaper, referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
After the Dublin Agreement, refugees are the responsibility of the EU Member State, which they first reach.
If a migrant moves to another EU country, this state can send him back to the country of entry.
To justify this, the Office now writes: "In the meantime, the reception capacity of families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly".
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU Member States would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
In the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, the spokesperson of the left-wing group, criticised this decision: "Family with children are threatening human rights reception conditions and a threat to child welfare because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system".
Achieved second best result
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach already provided the blood donation service to other people.
At least by the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.
First of all, Jürgen Greule, who now shared 50 liters of blood with his now 100 donations.
Traditionally, at the meeting of the municipal council, the municipality honours the multiple willingness to donate blood.
"It is ingenious how our body is designed to do this and we pay respect to the donors who provide their blood for strangers, even to that end, unprofitable," underlined Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood donation helps several people," explained the circuit board leader of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, because the canned canned can be broken into its components.
So three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions carried out in the spring in Oberreichbach.
"This year, we achieved the second best result with 114 donors," said the DRK-Kreisbereisschaftsführungsführer.
Apparently, the change to the theater house had led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago.
Previously, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded 50 donations each.
Half as many book Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Prümmer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter delivered ten times per 500 milliliters of their juice.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and inflation slowing down speculation about an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "difficult" as it maintained the interest rates on family income in the middle of a strengthening pressure.
The Bank's Monetary Committee (MPC) policymakers voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members seeking an increase this month, as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7% for 2017 and 1.6% for 2018 and warned that pressure on household income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to almost 3% in autumn.
But it signaled that in the coming years interest rate increases would be necessary to offset the inflation raised by Brexit and it said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.
The members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammut cyclical package issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will require time for the financing plan to provide more affordable funding for banks from next February, although it is said that it is now expected to provide more 15 billion pounds within this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as the pressure on real household income continues to burden consumption."
In terms of interest rates, it reiterated that "a certain degree of streamlining of monetary policy" would be necessary to cool inflation and "a little greater" than the markets expected.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another one in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be made "progressively" and "limited".
The bank's forecast growth downwards for this year and next year are 1.9% and 1.7% compared to the forecast in May.
It maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell on these news vis-à-vis the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to USD 1.31 and fell by 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision will not change as recent disappointing growth rates have dampened the rising expectations for an increase in interest rates and GDP rose from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3% in the second quarter.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly after the bank towards the end of the year.
The recent report on inflation showed little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and low wage increases, as the increase is even worse in the first place before it is improved.
She added that monetary policy will not be able to "prevent" the rise in income in the coming years, but she added that wages will be "clear" by the end of her three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will compensate for some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes one year after the reduction in interest rates to 0.25% last August after the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this is fully achieved by prices and the economy.
Prior to the last Bank's judgment on interest rates, the call for an increase in interest rates had increased as inflation increased the pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policy makers calling for an increase of 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9% in last month to 2.6% in June, although the bank said that this was expected and will attract it again in the coming months.
The bank said that the excess over its 2% target was due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "In view of the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market should become more competitive again, as the lenders are scrupulously looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those who end the existing deals and close the new mortgages, and many with free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular."
NHS (National Health Service) is intended to prescribe controversial HIV drugs for 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment starting in September following a fight in front of the High Court against financing the drug in the NHS.
NHS England reported that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now delivered by the health service through a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people.
He declared himself ready to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal confirmed last year a judgment of the Supreme Court, according to which the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.
The chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England Chief Simon Stevens as a "important new intervention", while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called this a "departing moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to enable people to register, and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in all of England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious patients.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in a person's body to prevent an HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
In clinics, suitable participants are identified who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also sign up for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic.
The program will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence, as it is widely used, taken up and implemented.
Stevens said: "This great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of progress in dealing with one of the greatest health challenges facing mankind."
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, where it is targeted at people in need and at risk, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not negotiated with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be that the study is conducted quickly throughout the country and that no one who is at risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been obtained, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."
Sharon Hodgson, shadow health minister, said: "The beginning of the PrEP process is welcomed and overdue after months of delays and delay in implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can stop the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people infected with HIV and that it will help to bring us a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.'
Living the Great Life: Intermediate and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced from a big house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It's on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it's proof of the new design that Joanne didn't pack and sell her bags.
"Before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger room," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earl's Court, and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day."
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet large apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-room facility with a shacked layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne's storage room and an intermediate floor to make optimum use of the spacious ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my request," she says.
To this end she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12,5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms across each other, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the default.
"The steelworks are quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked together without having to bow down.
It was not only about building a simple platform, but about laying the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height above each other - with much additional drama.
For the intermediate floor, a classic copper light window from Retrovius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and Vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light.
At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer.
In the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window in another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all cutlery and glasses from Joanne.
By perceiving a more glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can lock the kitchen if it is not used.
Foldable kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it's a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went in there," explains Erfan of the steel reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"It's counterweight, so when you push the door up it glides very lightly."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day you will sell the land – or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a land-size-based calculation."
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor area while using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electric sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they do not play with your heart."
It shows that an apartment can transform itself into something quite amazing through good design and increased square meters of something standard.
In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave them.
Brothers are fighting for a $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers are four decades old, after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute over one of Victoria’s largest real estate empires worth over 500 million dollars.
The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors away from his younger brother Paul. He has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how to divide their property and business assets.
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp debate about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have raised 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the family bought a business on Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
The Westco Jeans family was founded there and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold in 1999 for USD 85 million.
This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping malls in the suburbs.
According to an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - described by Paul as the "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - has about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.
A court act states that this means that Colin owns property worth 316 million dollars and Paul has a value of 176 million dollars.
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects," he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed hearings.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of managing some possessions incompetently.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs rise in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were Italian immigrants who had milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property, where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school, when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property to their sons kindly.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis Group, where Colin claims that Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million upon leaving the company.
Both Luke and Mark were embittered, Paul says, "about the conditions of their financial separation."
Colin has been very restrained, although he was a former AFL member and after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin answered by SMS to say "I really can't say much" because the case is before the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and drag our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he "hoped for a solution all the time."
On Friday, this hope seemed to be over.
"Our case will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the President's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including the reports of the news media - in the hope of keeping the chief on a more uniform course.
Here's a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior staff on his first working day, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information that came into the hands of the President.
Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information."
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"When candidate Trump was annoyed by unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair report from offices that were to be convinced," said former election adviser Sam Nunberg to Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former election officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise price."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign officials know something we don't know about others - that Trump's Tweets would have contained even more explosives without their intervention.
We'll probably never learn anything about the tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his employees had managed to keep him out of trouble several times, then their efforts have paid off.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, repeatedly try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world.
Politico - quite concerned with this story - reported in May on the preference of the consultants to supply the president with dubious information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he's trying to figure out where they come from.
That was exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the Internet Prosecutor Charles C. Johnson, who accused the Deputy Chief Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a bunch of leaks" in the White House.
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter because of harassment or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has in the past made false accusations and revoked them.
Trump read the article and began to question employees about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "sought to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives".
How did it work?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove himself more effective as a priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence.
These unchangeable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals receive mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population will be asked and hoped for.
Police across Europe are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer.
As the addresses of the sought-after heavy offenders are not known of course, indications from the population are hoped and asked for.
Europol reported on Friday on the action following the winter's "EU Most Wanted" convention calendar.
Experience has shown that many refugees are hiding in holiday destinations, said Europol.
21 postcards were compiled for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016 there has been the website www.eumostwanted, which has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online visitors have so far been arrested, at least eleven of them due to post-publishing information on the website.
Travellers negotiate a tomb and return to the 'Millionaires-Reihe'
Some of the most wealthy homeowners in the West Midlands are once again standing on warfoot with determined travelers who have negotiated a trench drawn by the community to demand a field in front of their mansions.
Travelers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull called the "Millionary Series".
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were thrown out in May, without however being frightened by a grave dug out by the Council to prevent their invasions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defense units and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unimpeded to find a way.
Angry residents have pressed the advice of Solihull, who said that it is "useless to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said, "They moved there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley Heath where they threw stones at the passersby.
The Council must be forced into action by shame for implementation, as it was useless in dealing with the problem.
Travelers were there in May, moved on and are back now.
More arrived last night, probably even more today."
She added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by keeping long instructions to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue paying my municipal tax if the Council can't even stop it."
A resident who didn't want to be called said, "It's ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers just to be plundered by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and one has even seen a horse in the parking area."
A spokesperson of Solihull's Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp on the land beyond the Streetsbrook Road and are working with Solihull's police. We take the necessary legal steps to keep them moving as quickly as possible.
In order to support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case."
From Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise
From the former hotel Birkenhof the Waldhotel Luise becomes.
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on March 1st next year.
That's good news for the city.
With the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Bedrijfsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, around 30 000 nights per year were lost at that time and also revenues from the tourist tax.
In autumn 2014, in view of the dramatic rise in the number of refugees arriving in the district, the hotel building was offered to the Landratsamt as a collective accommodation, which provided for controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by drawing up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not undisputed in the council at that time.
But above all the city's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel's location and already spoke of serious interested people at the house.
He should be right.
The group of Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the joyous city object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luise Park, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
The former hotel Birkenhof has been in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is being done.
The floors were demolished, ceilings partially dismantled, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single building.
There's a lot to do by March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walkable showers, the entrance area is remodeled, new windows are installed.
Everything was to be "beautiful close to the citizen", as Thomas Scherer expressed himself.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry out there."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are included.
You do not want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already at an elevated city center level, Scherer emphasizes.
The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wanted to set up wide, Scherer explains further.
Both individual vacationers, groups or businessmen should feel comfortable at the hotel.
He has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, according to Scherer.
The city's ideas were similar to those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
Asked about the amount of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to determine himself exactly.
Just under one million euros, he's counting.
The external systems are also brought to the front, which is already clearly visible.
In a courtyard there is a large terrace that will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
Russia-Affe: US-Sonderermittler launches Grand Jury
In Russia's case around US President Donald Trump, Special Agent Robert Mueller is said to have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report.
The panel has taken up the job in recent weeks, wrote the Wall Street Journal on behalf of people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper considered the step as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigations.
The station CNN reported that there were already first launches of the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump's eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US secret services have been accusing the Kremlin of getting involved specifically in the 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mueller investigates whether there were agreements between Trump's election team and Moscow.
The focus of the investigation is to be on several men who acted as Republican advisor in the election campaign.
According to reports, Mueller also took more and more Trump's private and business environment under the spotlight.
The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Agent Trump personally moved to the center and investigated the allegation that the president might have obstructed justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of the Grand Juries is to examine this evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide whether to bring an action.
The Grand Juries are therefore also called the Public Prosecutor's Chambers.
They are usually switched on when they are larger and controversial cases.
The procedure is always done behind closed doors.
The board can also be activated by the prosecutor's office to invite people to hear under oath.
According to the CNN transmitter, there were already launches that revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
Those involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement, the report said.
In addition, they should provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his former election director Paul Manafort were also present for the conversation.
Legal experts said on Thursday evening at the U.S. TV that the setup showed that Mueller did not let himself be intimidated in his work and that he wanted, if necessary, to act quickly.
However, it did not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury would end up being turned on to decide about the collection of charges.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the panel was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.
In the middle of the new revelations on Thursday evening, the President used a speech in West Virginia to represent Russia's affairs as a campaign of his political opponents.
"The Russia story is a total invention," said Trump.
The theme gives the Democrats a way to "feel good because they have nothing else to talk about".
His Special Advisor Ty Cobb stated in a statement that he knew nothing about setting up a Grand Jury.
But they also usually work in secret, he stressed.
The White House supported any measures which would speed up the work of the special investigator in a "fair" way.
The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that no investigation was made against the president.
There was no reason to believe that something had changed about this, so the statement continued.
But Mueller had only been used after Trump fired Comey.
Because of this robbery, charges against Trump had become loud, he wanted to hinder the judiciary.
Comey told a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to stop the investigation against former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure because of the inquiry.
After depicting US media, the White House collected material against the special investigator and his employees.
This triggered speculation as to whether Trump would release Mueller.
Unlike an independent special agent of the Congress, such as the Watergate affair with Richard Nixon, who later resigned, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the President of the Ministry of Justice.
However, several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.
On Thursday two groups of Republican and Democratic Senators presented draft laws that the special investigator could no longer be released so easily.
Antarctica: Giant iceberg drifts in the Antarctic
In the Westantarktis, a gigantic iceberg of nearly seven times the size of Berlin has been solved by the Schelfeis.
This was announced by the Bremerhaven Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.
The colossus, over one trillion tons and 5800 square kilometers, are now heading north and will probably need two, three years until it is melted.
With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest giants who have been registered by researchers over the past three decades.
A danger to humans does not come from him.
To what extent climate change has played a role in the collapse of the iceberg is unclear according to research data.
However, for about 30 years there has been a series of unusual breakdowns of ice shales in the region, the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) writes in a factual background.
Many researchers believe that this could be related to global warming.
The now severed Colossus was a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.
Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It therefore grows further and further into the sea and breaks regularly.
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic peninsula.
Northern this saffron was disturbed by the balance of waxes and breaks a few years ago.
A complete shelfeis had fallen apart there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, because the front edge has never moved as far as it is.
In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can be broken if a piece is broken at a key point.
The melting of smelt ice and iceberg does not increase the sea level, as it swims on the water and ice disperses as much water as it results after melting itself.
However, the loss of the Schelfeise means that the glaciers can pour directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.
This could possibly increase sea levels, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project on monitoring Antarctica (Midas).
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest schlelfeis in Antarctica, according to AWI data with almost 50,000 square kilometres.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge of the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from Swansea University.
"This is the farthest retreat since the beginning of the recordings," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, it was disputed whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis would grow again or go back in the long term and possibly coincide, his colleague Adrian Luckman said and added: "Our models say it will be less stable".
But this development will last decades.
Even if these researchers do not bring this gigantic iceberg to a halt to climate change, there have been a lot of icebergs in the Antarctic peninsula in recent decades.
This long tip of the Antarctic extends to South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research program, the Antarctic Peninsula's ice surface has decreased by 28,000 square kilometers since the 1950s.
The temperature increase has contributed to the decline.
In the past 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up by about three degrees and thus counts to the areas where the temperature is rising most rapidly.
CDU wants a home rate for staff
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacancies, the CDU is calling for the employers' association to leave in order to become more attractive.
Only shortly before the summer break, the District Day has waved 41 new places in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the county administration in Mettmann.
Now 17 trainees have their first working day behind them.
The teaching places in the circle are apparently very sought after.
There were about 620 applications for the places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless, the circle lacks further staff to cope with the increased requirements and tasks.
There are still 50 unoccupied places in the district of Mettmann.
Doctors and engineers are sought, among other things, as well as forces of general administration.
The CDU, together with the FDP and the UWG, now wants to take the initiative and address the lack of staff in the administration.
The administration is to "develop a concept of human resources and human resources development" according to the wishes of the parties.
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for skilled workers but to counteract future-oriented shortages, it says.
The overall approach should be internally and externally oriented, identify concrete measures for cross-integer and include a training offensive, calling for CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with staff problems that you didn't know so much earlier.
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
The speech is of a regular "competition of public employers".
In addition, a high number of employees leave the service because of illness or old age.
Maximum time to act, therefore, so that no more jobs remain unoccupied.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, head of the CDU, goes beyond the joint request with his party.
He had recently given a big surprise on the circuit day when he publicly challenged the personnel cost cap and surprised the other parties.
Peoples want to review all possibilities that allow for withdrawal from the local employers' association.
"If we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term, the county administration should strive for a household tariff with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the associated cities," says Peoples.
This means that the CDU is trying to pay the employees and officials better than it actually provides for the collective agreement for the public service.
The salaries are currently precisely prescribed, increases or more money is only available if you change to a higher level which is oriented towards careers.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up, in which employees took care of the provisions of the new Prostitute Protection Act.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and district director Martin Richter have a problem: you have too few staff.
Italy enhances the sound of NGO-migrants rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs, who use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean, that they should not continue this if they do not comply with new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitis Warning came one day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German aid organization 'Jugend Rettet' because their team had worked effectively with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which has only been in operation for one year, refused to comment on detailed allegations by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is and remains our top priority. So we are very sorry that we cannot currently operate in the search and rescue zone," said the organisation in a statement on social media.
"We can only assess all the allegations that are currently being made after we have collected all the information and are able to assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had monitored the boat of 'Jugend Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is assumed that his crew takes on board tugboat migrants who are delivered to them directly from human traffickers, and that smugglers can leave so that the ships can be reused.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the file of the prosecutor whose contents were published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of overseeing the authority of the Italian Coast Guards, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reasons.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to keep to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring about any "essential changes or handicaps" of their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Laureate Organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti now said that the number of migrants arriving after the rescue measures in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguards and cooperate with local mayors have borne fruit.
"In the last few days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
He announced plans for further discussions with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Increases and Trials
Neun Weilermer Biker, the "Berliner Aussteigenposten" and two guest riders met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz to enjoy for four days trials and sights.
Three friendly guides were available for this.
Accommodation in the Wachenheim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led along the vineyards at hot summer temperatures to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.
It was followed by viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far over the Palatinate Forest and the surrounding plains.
In the meantime, there were longer and longer increases for the long trials rewarded.
On the second day it went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and to the Volksfest sausage market.
Viewing point was once again at the lookout point, connected by "flowy" trials and moderate rises.
On the last two days there were again many height meters in demand.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and retreats brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers in the open-air inhalatorium breathed healing suns in.
Neustadt was also controlled.
After 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters of altitude, the group had met the Pfälzer Forest from its best side - sporty and cultural.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga prepares for e-sport
Are the sports stars facing computer consoles in the future instead of struggling sweatily with wind and weather over the stadium terrace?
In fact, e-sport has long become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high alleys included.
This has also been recognised by the first federal leagues who are increasingly involved in this area.
The VfL Wolfsburg started in 2015, followed by FC Schalke 04 and, last but not least, VfB Stuttgart, which founded an E-sports department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game.
"We hope to inspire very new young target groups for the VfB," says Jochen Röttgermann.
He's sure, "that on this train there are still some clubs."
The next weekend, the Football World Association FIFA in London will organise the first interactive club World Cup in which the gamers of different clubs will compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.
"The real football team has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds in particular that the young people will still be in the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets, especially Asian ones.
With prominent e-sporters under contract, you could be present online more often in these markets than just once a year sending the Bundesliga team to Asia.
What's the point?
In e-sports, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2, "Counterstrike" or just the football simulation FIFA are challenged at the competition level.
In the long run, as in normal sports, leagues have established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other.
And at the Asia Games in 2022, E-Sport is already part of the official program.
But is it even a real sport?
For many, the notion is certainly in need of habit.
Ingo Froböse has also been dealing with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports University in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that are also found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also needs cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding and a fast response capability.
Professional gamers should not only work on the console, but also exercise their bodies and pay attention to the diet.
"The fit player is a good player."
Frobøse also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more a topic".
Controls were difficult to carry out in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing.
The scientist positively highlights the high integrative effect of e-sports.
Players are on the international road, which is like a large global family, since there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by Deloitte and the Bundesverbandes Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sports.
In 2016, 50 million euros had been implemented in Germany, mainly via advertising, sponsorship and large tournaments.
In three years, sales are expected to be 130 million.
The football federal league has little to do with the almost 2.4 billion euros.
However, the e-sport "is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," the Deloitte consultants write.
Internationally, many countries are still in existence.
Large markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-Basketball players Shaquille O`Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport game provider Unikrn.
There are also some things going on in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sports had been introduced as a subject of instruction, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, the Football Firstliga Associations are now obliged, according to Dutt, to set up an e-sport department.
"In European comparison, Germany is lagging behind," explains VfB CEO Röttgermann.
Only to fall into nostalgia, and to teach the old times, is no longer enough.
It is about preserving the tradition of the association, but at the same time aligning the company on the modern market.
"We live in a digitalized world," says Dutt.
"You can't hold on to the fact that only at football will everything stay the way it always was."
Poison egg ade - The egg alternatives for cooking and baking
Almost all the states are affected by the scandal of poisoned eggs.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have responded and removed all eggs from the sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs that are shown to contain no fipronil are to be taken into the shelves.
Michelle Carter, convicted of the texts that forced Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend by texts and calls for suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were suspended on parole.
Carter was sentenced in June for the negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who took his life on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family is insolent.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appointment.
She had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a creamy blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and down eyes when she was sentenced.
"Your actions have killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She didn't take responsibility," she said.
"She has shown no repentance."
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "frightful circumstance that she totally regrets".
Judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, that he did not find out that her "age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions".
An prosecutor read a statement by Roy's mother Lynn Roy saying that there is "no day I don't look after the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters in spite of all my pains that we will carry for eternity," it says.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she was "pursued" by the knowledge that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt for his children.
"No longer having this only person I have been with since my birth every day is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case appears to be a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask someone else to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Get up, jump from a building, first yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention through the death of Roy and ordered that she benefit from the case through any press.
The case shared the legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was sentenced in 2007 to murder of her British roommate in Italy before being acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new mini lamb of the FC Bayern
Joshua Kimmich was not allowed to appear as a captain at the Audi Cup.
FC Bayern has a great season to wear to the Confed Cup winner - there is no harm to extra motivation.
Something else was there on his place in the cabin, which Joshua Kimmich saw right away, although the extra garment was very small.
But since far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup there was of course no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer to be seen, he made himself the bound of his arm.
"The coach didn't announce it," said the Confed Cup winner afterwards, after his first engagement as Bayern captain.
Well, the stop could have been better than the 0:2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign from the coach could also mean Kimmich.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal had been selected as a leader in the C-Elf, which was made up of youth players, debutants and those who had just come from the holiday.
Sugar is best distributed to those to whom you want to keep to yourself.
So anyone who has been chosen to enter the legacy of lamb can only use a small extra motivation well.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: take responsibility".
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flew over the field as a mini lamb.
Right behind, that's his position now, the white tie on her arm did the rest of her.
And at all events Kimmich worked in this start-up formation like the one who can also take the rowing in the best of hands.
He gave instructions, tried to steer the unplayed force.
He had the look for the whole while many others were busy with himself.
Vidal with overplaying his lack of fitness (pronounced); Renato Sanches with the fact that he had come out of the service of the Asian trip to hell (also only due to the lack of fitness); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle with the fact that they did not show up negatively in their first appearance in the Bayern tricot.
After all, that worked out quite well.
Süle ran next to Kimmich, Rudy in front of the defense, both acting sovereign.
The well-known Napoleonic storm often took a hard time, and Süle also tried to successfully build the game a few times.
Although his colleague Rudy admitted that the result was "not as we hoped."
But he also showed a decent performance during his debut.
Game shift, change of pace: "For this style, I was also picked up".
How unusual this Bayern world is still for the new arrivals, one saw after the game.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but determined six or seven interviews.
After a few cracky statements, Kimmich passed away in the back of his new co-players.
There he heard from Süle an interesting sentence: "What's going on here, I've already noticed.
At Bavaria you just have to win every game".
After all, he doesn't have to teach the new one anymore.
Alabama Motivates OFB Women
David Alabama believes in the success of our OFB ladies
Austria's most famous footballer has reported on Twitter shortly before the game and wished the ÖFB ladies all the best.
The Bayern-Legionary is a member of the club of ÖFB-Capital Schnaderbeck and is enthusiastic about our ladies.
The tweet of Austrian footballer of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivational shot.
Our ladies might also need the famous Bayern Duel.
Company satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: Economy praises Wissings Tempo
It was often inconvenient, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This appears after more than a year in which the new Minister for Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak on T-V request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association of Trier Enterprises (VTU), says: "Wissing addresses the wishes of the economy that Lemke has all blocked".
The biggest turning point is that Natus sees in infrastructure policy: the gap of the 1 motorway between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the very top of the country's priority list.
This year the Ministry hopes for a planning process, until 2021 building law will stand.
A role in the country's plans is also played by the west-winding of Trier, which is at the forefront of the federal road map.
The aim is to start up the route in December 2020, says Ministerial Speaker Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees it as a signpost to support regional, but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) Trier, as suggested by Wissing, strives for a Rhineland-Palatinate label in wine to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports that have been falling for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to set up their own company, the IHK praises.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees an additional incentive for young trainees in the new Master Bonus, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A prize of 1000 euros is foreseen for the passed master's exam and 2500 euros when graduates become independent within ten years of master's training.
The housework list for the country remains a long one.
At the time of the planned road construction, it was quickly possible to create facts, and at the same time the country lacks the necessary staff," says Jan Glockauer, IHK Trier's Chief Executive.
Of 56 new engineers who want to recruit Wissing at the Landesbetrieb Mobility, 29 jobs have so far been filled.
The IHK calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices.
The CDU Group Vice Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors, the country invests more than 20 million euros in the preservation of state roads than proposed in 2017 and 2018.
Frank Natus also expects a country concept, as it wants to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
It was also sobering to see the expansion of broadband in the country so far.
In 2016, regional companies evaluated the network supply in an IHK survey only with note 3.4.
They complain about increasing Internet connections and interruptions.
On the other hand, former Minister of Economic Affairs Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and is still on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe, where she had already cleared the field after four months of disagreement.
Audi is supposed to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter-reaction
One day before the Audi announcement, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW president said that the company felt that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions", and this concerned European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to prohibit or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the companies as a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with CO2 emission rules.
But nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The costs for car manufacturers to install systems to neutralise the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles are also increasing, which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged with hounding the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies try to avoid the faults of Volkswagen that could regulate the use of so-called shut-off devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car has been tested but go back under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees were charged, others examined on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in Audi's engine development in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to justice in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations into Volkswagen, after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to bypass the emission regulations in Europe, and an inquiry focused on the United States was expanded.
The involvement of Audi in the investigation could burden Volkswagen heavily: the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the profits of Volkswagen.
This message has the raft on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order for the Isar visitors to join in, a river flows through Munich on the morning of Saturday, which has a special message.
If it moves again to the Isar on Saturday, it will see a large raft between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And that's not a normal raft, with Isar tourists.
But the building conference wants to clarify.
On the raft you can see a great information transparency.
It shows a garbage dump.
The start of a public campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "Where is love ...", the understanding of the Isar is to sharpen as a protective wild flow.
Last summer the river passed over the Isar and this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a reverential and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Murdillo's nostrils and laughing at the suffering
Mordillo was sometimes one of the most published cartoon characters, the nodules noses of his figures are his trademarks.
Also with 85, the Argentinean still draws and works on a film.
His message: laugh, "because there is too much suffering in the world".
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrant in Buenos Aires.
In the first years as an artist, he went through, among other things, as a drawing artist for greeting cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when my job was lost," he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he succeeded in the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in the "star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again, the artists were inspired by cities.
Large round murderillo figures are in drawings with the Pisa Shief Tower, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own information, he still sits on the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
About calendars, puzzles, books for big and small, t-shirts, plush animals and watches his daring figures continue to be widely distributed around the world.
For six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters.
The main person in the movie "Crazy Island" is a Giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousand-fisser as a counterpart.
For the first time, his characters speak in the 3D film, which is due to come to cinema in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's weird for me," says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
That's why he puts on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced without a word.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is declining due to the conditions of drought and insects transmitted due to the diseases, which causes great headaches to scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which has brought much less rain in spring and much more in autumn.
This has an impact on the lifetime of lavender.
There is also a small cicada, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are many of them."
And there's a lot at stake.
Lavender oil not only attracts holidaymakers, it is also very much needed for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: " Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have less parts with essential oil."
The solutions considered include better water distribution and the slowing down of soil evaporation, as well as the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dryness.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200th anniversary this year.
Festive highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Creamers, fumes, merchants, vagants or a national camp should be experienced in the city center on these days.
The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in Sinaloa state by organized crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
It was told to them that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children to the office, which was the target of a grenades attack in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
You ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is necessary to provide perceptions and gut feelings.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the government's or cartel's payroll, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no rest from the violence, and while the bodies accumulate throughout the country, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats and so far there have been at least seven dead in seven states this year.
Among the latter are their editor and inspirational director of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence.
His lack is felt deeply, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice", hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, it has, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, only started two criminal proceedings.
As with most thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime each year, journalists' murderers are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce they are still insisting on treating Sinaloa's violence, although they are inconsolable and although the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little use, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, we all mistrust."
On the morning of May 15th, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and was shot at him 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twolft River".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a woman and two grown children.
Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.
But there is practically nothing but silence on the subject of Valdez.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the most bloody battlefields in the country, since rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that every day in Sinaloa someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey mausoleums for drug kings who are bigger than many houses for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "rest" if only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.
Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was guilty of not being able to protect his friend.
He believes two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
First in February there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have annoyed the sons, suspect gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kioskske.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars of holdings.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the drug problem," said Bojorquez.
In time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-hit research without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot Prize" for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in persecuting Mexican drug history wherever she led.
He voluntarily admitted he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You have to take on the task that happens to you as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid.
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do in the face of so many dead people... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the funny bird who could fly like a port worker, the friend who was generous with embraces and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted in his routine.
He'd always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and sit there always at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love for the routine his destruction?
His death has also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do her work and keep her alive.
"They don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways and highways" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-sustaining.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, the editor of the Riodoc Andres Villarreal said that "geek a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as not in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where there is a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce's employees met for security training, suddenly no mobile phones were allowed. Days before, it was announced that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.
They were commissioned by the government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class district of Culiacan.
Half of the joke, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of the police who the governor himself called untrustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For the issue of this week, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of formerly known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé of government expenditure, which concentrated on the home city of the governor.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was given when it was time to write what everyone in town knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug traffickers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled almost all political levels throughout the century.
Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this local, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.
Only a few months earlier, the readers would have considered Valdez's column to be the best-informed source of kidnapping.
"In the past, we already knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slim body statue.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdez's office was turned into a storage room for signs and stickers protesting the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they themselves had never expected: activists in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez picked up a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning because of another journalist to the prosecutor's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests, that it is his.
Journalists throughout the country have become louder by writing "SOS Press" in organized protests on walking paths and buildings.
On this day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying out journalists and killing them because they told the truth.
She has since requested that she be re-assigned by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "encircled" by organized crime, government officials involved in it and an indifferent society.
In his last book "Narco Journalism", he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also under the command of politicians and security forces who were covered with organized crime.
Last year, the Media Guard Group "Articulo 19" assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists from police and civil servants.
"In Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth shut," said Ramirez.
Apparently, the murders have a deterrent effect.
Nobody forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Zetas board: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to their separated head.
Some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue to do so as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after her director was murdered in 2004.
In 2010 the Diario de Ciudad Juarez was publicly addressed to the drug cartel with an editorial on the title page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they're still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as it seems to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Veracruz.
For those who remain behind and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade scares him.
"Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones started to sum up.
A number of shootings with bandenrivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a number of Cartel messages in the region.
From the edge of the board they have published the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile phone.
The title page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens cried in the vicinity - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the police who were keeping watch to see if they were ready.
If they were scared at all, they wouldn't show it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to all of Sinaloa, Riodoce's employees followed his lead.
"How can you even think of closing," Bojorquez said, "if the day Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the street for reporting."
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid their enemies
At first glance it looks like a statue, though a terrifying one.
Researchers have now found out that the first findings of the incredible rhinoceros of a Canadian miner have been so well preserved that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa the Dinosaur".
It was so well received that they could even see that his shuffling skin was of reddish brown - and they said she had something of a "disquieting past".
The report in the magazine "Current Biology" called him "the best-preserved dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world".
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurier that lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the mid-Creation period.
His incredibly well-preserved condition has amazed researchers, who describe it as "really remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he was buried on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.
He met up with something that seemed to be missing from the surrounding rock, and decided to look closer.
Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrell Museum of Palaeontology.
They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy earth clogs.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you just blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it has fallen asleep," said chief author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will go into science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that this plant eater, although covered with a armor and similar to a changing tank, was probably threatened by meat-ding dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-harmonies, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to mix better in its surroundings and avoid its enemies, experts say what indicates that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours carefully discovering it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armor over his body.
They discovered the countershade, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although the counter shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta exceeds the size of the animals living today.
It indicates that the dinosaur was hunted by meat - consuming dinosaurs from sufficient pressure, that evolution favored the veiling of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most of the contemporary animals that use the counter shattering - think of deer, zebras or deer - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, which signals that this nodo-saurier was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretan Age must have been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for evidence of its life, including its preserved intestinal content, to find out what it has eaten as its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the seabed.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as Southflorida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaur is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but is also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal," Brown said.
"The result is that the animal today looks almost the same as in the early Creep Age.
You don't need much imagination to use to reconstruct it. If you're just shooting a little with your eyes, you could almost think he's sleeping."
Creed time was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs, traversed the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his frightening ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was sunk in the sea after death and mummified in mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he was buried on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum it is the best preserved dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the snout to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long tips rising from its shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored plant eater was swam through western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur kept its armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover bumpy pants along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is 'as rare as a win in the lottery.
The more I see it, the more confusing it becomes.
Rocked remains of the skin still cover the hollow armored plates that carry the animal’s skull.
His right front foot is on his side, his five fingers are spread up.
I can count the scales on his sole.
In the thunderstorm: mass carambola position on A8: Many injured
On Thursday evening on the A8: Nearly 30 vehicles are wrapped in a mass carambola.
There are numerous injured, mile - long dams and forks.
On the Stuttgart-München motorway (A8) about 20 people were injured in a mass carambola on the late Thursday afternoon.
According to the police's first information, between the junction points Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Landkreis Aichach-Friedberg) about 5 p.m. and a thunderstorm were almost 30 vehicles, probably also trucks.
At first there were no data on the exact number of victims.
It's about slight to moderate injuries, said a police officer.
A large supply of rescue vehicles was at the scene of the accident.
The A8 was completely blocked towards Munich.
In the direction of travel in Munich there was a ten-kilometre-long backstack.
As reported by an AZ reporter, there were also massive obstacles on the counterroads – due to numerous Gaffers.
The fire brigade noted the marks of the drivers who now have to count on sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 18:45 a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the scene of the accident.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "Comfort Check-in"
It's a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: nothing to be guessed is sitting on the train and sleeping.
Or one is deeply involved in his work and just has a brilliant thought.
And then: puff.
Comes the creator and wakes up an unsavoury or rips the passenger out of the middle of the workflow.
Check of tickets.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the non-manufacturer’s ticket control.
One simply confirms by phone that one takes his place and thereby devalues the ticket.
A test operation is currently running on two lines.
"If the offer comes up, let's expand it.
It is expected that it will be available at the beginning of next year on many further long-distance routes in Germany," said a railway spokesperson.
"Comfort Check-in" is the name of the train that calls the ticket withdrawal without a creator.
In order to be able to use it, however, some requirements need to be met: You need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - which is what most passengers do anyway.
You must also have bought it via the app of the train, the DB Navigator, which is anyway the most convenient way of booking the ticket.
And last time you need a seat reservation.
Because the "Comfort Check-in" works like this: You get into the train, call up his ticket under "My Tickets".
At the test customers a button for electronic de-evaluation will appear.
On their mobile devices, the train attendants receive a message that the passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
When the train attendant comes to Y place, he knows that there is a passenger with already devalued online ticket.
So you can keep sleeping, keep working, keep silent.
The "Check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers.
"Who wants to relax without a ticket control travel through our train attendants simply checks on the DB Navigator itself.
This allows passengers to make their travel time more personal on the train," says Michael Peterson, Marketing Director of DB Distance Transport.
Second Plus: "And our employees have more time than today to address individual customer needs".
Those who often travel by train know that, in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket checks are among the biggest troubles.
Because often you have, but in any case one of the co-traders does not have all the documents that you need to devalue online tickets.
Either the credit card or the ID card is missing or a document you need to present.
The result is endless discussions between the train attendant and the passenger, which leads to a bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling your own ticket and takes the time to take care of other matters at the end.
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
And that also only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Further train numbers on the same track are not yet fully accessible.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to the core.
Only one day after she arrived in New York City, the one who was born in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an Airbnb apartment, which she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled over a post from someone from high school.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," it said.
Confused, because no one else on their feed had posted the information, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the @TheePharoah trade was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was about to tweet live the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body, which was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to them and their community.
She dropped her phone off to return later in the evening to Tweets about people on the Canfield Drive.
There were photos of police gangs and people screaming, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father, who carried a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman secured his rifle and shouted, "I will kill you all animals."
"This is not usual," Ferrell recalled her statement.
"This is not the kind of murder we've gotten used to and can call typical."
At that moment I felt shudder rust.
I was angry and crying."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 2 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?", in the cinemas from the 11th century.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience that consists of the vision of people living in the community and who have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a matching crown, the two discussed a conversation that she had innumerable times before this morning "about the black experience and the black condition".
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" she remembered what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take them," Ferrell said later.
"What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.
She needs to know and see it and be brought up in it.
It must be well developed not only to know activism and organization, but also to know the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to become free to free ourselves.
Even if I am lucky to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience ecstatic racism, she is no different than the next black child of women.
I have the feeling that I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it."
The first station to arrive in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police station, which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who had lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly a new kind of activism for Ferrell started to take shape.
"My activism changed completely after August 9th," she said, noting that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
Everything has come."
He was one of the co-directors of the film, and he was one of the co-directors of the film.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.
One question came up with Ferrell: "Do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?"
This scepticism was nourished by countless cases of human beings, often by whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently stated in an interview: "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not centre their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around death-traffic inmates.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, together with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary isn't someone talking to us or talking to us. We're talking," said Davis.
"That was the main thing for me, how these people are represented, because that's how I'll be represented."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folyan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" surprisingly show personal aspects of Ferrell's life how she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked," Ferrell said and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people."
In addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Life Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who have influenced the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media after the black teenager Trayvon Martin was killed in 2012, identify themselves as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have worn the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything."
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women".
She insists, however, that "this is not an affirmative type of action", in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity.
"She was the person who shook up this energy," she said.
"It's no coincidence, although it was on the front, because in a life at these crossings it's a black, gay woman that's so much at stake.
You can feel their energy through the screen."
The news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on probation for 21⁄2 years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.
She describes the social-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A chaos".
Nevertheless, she clings to a song and feels committed to this memory since she went to the street in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support one another.
We have nothing to lose except our chains."
From "dream" to "dreader": TV readers discuss bit gallery
The bit gallery moves the people, although it has not been built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping center on the south end of the pedestrian zone has split the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
The subject is cold.
The topic will also be discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While the one says to the bit gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schaussten), comes from the other side: "Do not need a man" (Siggi Betzen) or simply: "Bigs Scholz!" (Lars Scholz).
While the supporters build on the fact that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, which also benefits the rest of the businesses, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then bleed out.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the plot where the farmer's market hall is located, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.
At the beginning of the construction work this will be finished.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - and to the Beda square with the possibility of sitting outside.
Simone Zimmer: "For many years we have been buying almost weekly in the farmer's market hall.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the landwives are always very happy.
We've also discovered the machetes for ourselves.
We would like to see an opportunity to maintain this offer even during and, above all, after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities, there is.
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers are located in a market hall in the gallery, the amount of the rent will increase.
The new project, however, should not be very low."
Eva Kilic: "What shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find this unnecessary.
There's enough of that in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that we retain at least the market hall.
After all, the product offered there is fresh, is mostly offered directly by the producer and is above-priced.
As you can see, shops in a shopping center are only rented by larger companies, because the rentals there are often not portable for a retailer.
Damage, there are almost no more special shops and what's left of them will then probably disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping mall with a market hall doesn't fit together for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit into Bitburg.
Above all, where should the farmer's market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes at some point.
Or does the spooky bit gallery already manage to sell all the shops out of Bitburg before?"
George Marquet: "This just won't work.
And no one needs a shopping center that's empty.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farm market, instead of this gallery.
But for a farmer's market hall, thanks to the crazy many – as I think – construction projects in Bitburg no longer have any place.
When the farmer's market hall is demolished, a piece of culture will disappear."
A suitable resemblance: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost inconspicuously similar - that hang on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the cuts from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where the former intelligence analyst paid a 35-year prison sentence after she made diplomatic announcements about the WikiLeaks website classified as secret.
The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance (a suitable resemblance).
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united its expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and groundbreaking dissident whose condemnation of Barack Obama was transformed when he had only three days in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg has, through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits that someone could look like with this genomic data, a sharp, though some intellectual comment not only on the shapeability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created to identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward, but since her puberty spoke openly about the identification as a woman, was sentenced in 2013 to 20 charges, including six violations of the spying law, computer fraud and theft.
Through the prison her image was suppressed, so much so that there was only one photo - a granny, black-and-white selfie, in which Manning apparently sits unwell on a driver's seat and wears a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came precisely from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette stumps and gums by extracting the DNA from the waste to make a picture of what these people might look like.
That was the time she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked them if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned museum became unequal correspondence friends, who over the course of two years exchanged several letters.
They even created a comic "Superpressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which predicted a future in which President Chelsea's judgment would transform and she would be able to see the exhibition personally.
Indeed, just a few days after the book was published, Obama would ask for Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There is also now something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against Transgender troops in order to find new, tweetable ways to defuse the rigid divisions he was supposed to eliminate.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason".
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning demanded with her oversized signature (the "i" in her family name is marked with a heart) an end to "automatic fragmentation, the basis of which has been sex, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by including the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist) how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people will hopefully take with them is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so it's 30 of these stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the comic novelle mentioned above.
It shows Manning how she appears with a freephone in her hand from the disciplines of the United States like King-Kong.
"When they call your speech, they win," it says.
"So never shut up."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist who greets from Philadelphia.
"I still get goosebumps when I talk about it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition personally yet - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do so, she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulacres, which stand together like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 " 2, Mannings Statur), where their genetic haplo groups were written with pencil.
"In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said about the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind its liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford sought murder
A nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University who is sought as a suspect after a man has been stabbed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries.
On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were issued arrest warrants for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as shown by the files of Cook County's county court.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stings.
A community warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the body was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the site of the incident, and detectives investigate the stings as murder while the police actively seek the two suspects, said officials.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President of University Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem was now on leave and was excluded from joining Northwestern University campus.
"This is now a criminal matter that will be investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation," said Cubbage.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A speaker at the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in Great Britain and are ready to help the U.S. investigation authorities in every possible way."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand up.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said that he strongly calls on the suspects to stand up to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their place of residence, and our efforts to locate them are strengthening," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Square building who had just received a puzzling tip saying that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident also took place on 27 July.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management team published a statement to the residents: "The police are currently working on the timeline and the victim's background and are investigating a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will conclude the WADA driving plan in the near future" - the Russian Vice Prime Minister Mutko
The Russian vice-president Vitaly Mutko said it will not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian anti-Doping agency (RUSADA).
"At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA Roadmap has been updated in this respect," said Mutko on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the roadmap of the WADA to comply with the code that describes the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA and has recently been published on the organisation’s website.
According to Mutko, he contains nothing that could cause Russia to worry.
"Everything has been announced, everything is implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria set out in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on allegedly state-funded dopings in Russian sport.
Regarding the matter, Mutko said: "We conduct the investigation as our anti-doping system has encountered a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we won't admit anything that doesn't exist."
Mutko's words were consistent with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
In conversation with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov added problems to the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and rules.
Nobody wants to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
RUSADA was excluded from doping controls in Russia in November 2015 by WADA in the course of the doping scandal.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the headquarters of the organisation in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli explained that RUSADA is moving in the right direction to be used again.
Aldi is not selling eggs for the time being
This was announced by the groups of companies.
It was a purely precautionary measure that could continue to be based on no health impairment, as stated in the Communication.
From now on, only eggs should be delivered to Aldi, which have been shown to have been tested negative for fipronil-containing anti-lysing agents.
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency for its customers.
The start-ups that will help your company not to become the next top
Amy Errett wanted to measure the luck with your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys didn't work.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful or, worse still, fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
"There was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.
She called people from outside for help.
A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, address specific groups and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite executives and to contact the Board of Directors directly.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit to track their health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with glint.
In addition to the Snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat card from the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low consent results - so you can track why.
Companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you do not become the next Uber that has been involved in scandals, since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken have been punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $181.7 billion in 2020, according to the financial website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber trap in discredit.
Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized "pull" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The court of public opinion has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and managing director of Convert.
When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee flow and complaints, said Quinlan.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has been using Convert for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the corporate headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees.
Now that the company is using Convercent, problems previously identified and addressed by managers sitting in offices in cities or states such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices can be hidden.
"I can get closer to this holistic 360-degree view in the experience of employment," said Vitrano, head of the Ruby Tuesday Risk Management Group.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."
Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, said Quinlan.
But it took until the "social media came to their right" that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convert offer your software as a service, and burden companies with recurring fees for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity to find the consent of venture capital investors who supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in financing in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, thus raising the entire capital to $47 million.
Glitter secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his entire financing to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only bets.
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices are hearing, and that the work you are doing is worthwhile, they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employment Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies are running well. Companies are running well when employees are engaged and committed.
If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and staff deployment, it is no wonder that you will find support.
Data about the employee engagement according to the experts in workplace culture is important.
But the data are useless if the managers of a company do not take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change does not come quickly enough, or at all, it can cause disappointments and discourage employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.
"Because if you don't follow, employees will ask themselves, "Did you really hear me?
Do you take care of it?
And if you don't take care of it, why should I?"
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about glint, so Errett.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was through the speed of decision making and the quality of communication, able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is constantly getting new insights about employees, and it hopes that in the long term, this will lead to a better bonding of workers in an industry known for high sales.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, then you will lose business.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It goes to 23:00 when a lot of UCLA football players are entertaining on one side of the team's new exercise fields on campus.
Some have pulled out their jersey parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these busy minutes are a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three hour exercise, before returning to the Waterman Football Center at 6:30 a.m. the next morning.
"This is a real tretmühle for the boys the next three days," said Bruins coach Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the burden of the players, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the finale on Friday.
Therefore, the first three trainings of the UCLA should start at 19:15 in order to meet the players' already packed schedules.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins moved to the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six playtimes in Westwood did practical exercises.
They are scheduled to hold 18 exercises in the course of August. 20 before the start of the formal game preparation for their start against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supports the rule change of the NCAA, even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players.
"We put this enormous burden on her for three or four days, and it is very challenging," said Mora.
"And they just pushed it through, they keep popping, they're great people.
I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great."
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished, which, given the clear lines of view of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the superior class, which has already been challenged with footballs that cleared a safety net behind a torpoast, will not be an easy task.
Bruins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," said Mora.
"This is a real problem, and it's not far-fetched to think that people rent a room there and then adjust to record an exercise there.
If you have the videotape of an exercise, it's a pretty good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces in parking 8.
We'll do the best we can.
I'm not too worried about that.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify fact-finding in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages to third-party checkers and then display their results under the original article, said the world's largest online social network on Thursday. It is one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to detect possible false messages and to send them to fact-checkers, which may display the results of the fact-finding from the original article.
Facebook was criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe that they also influenced the 2016 US presidential elections.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, in which French voters were flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May, and Germany supports a plan to penalise social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful posts as before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts review will be started in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to finding out what stories are being challenged by third party experts, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the "related article" and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news.
Creating a Comic Roman: A castle in the history of England
In his recent past, the small Scotney Castle was seen in a Squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a Mopharian Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.
"I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he laments.
"What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' spans the period from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lengiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book by Rhodes based on an archive: He wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpected emotionally.
"I only reacted to the thumbprint on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobians," he says.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smelled like smoke, because then a fire was lit because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if it were his own.
Oh, I love archives!"
For someone who has been beaten with old papers so that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome greeting") this all seems too beautiful to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the trench.
He walked through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and talked to landscapers, gardeners and sometimes the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "Whiskey and began to write."
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust only got full access in 2006 when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said "Oh, throw it on the attic".
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, cards representing who had what: "One might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch around which two families fought.
Guys, let everything go!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive on a broader basis into English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant revolt of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that occurred in 1380 in the castle, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good start.
Maybe the two are connected?"
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit Father, who hid the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century was portrayed, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made only years later when his coffin was dug out).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be pretty thinner, always making debts and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking boys, with a talent to advertise into."
After the end of his engagement in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has taken a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of a Sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been demanded back by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to deal with the fucking life again."
Campaign launched: Over 300-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf veiled
With the cover of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign on Friday to launch a new roof brand (roundshow of Thursday).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
"Too good for us.
Or?", the makers of the action have asked on the posters at the Rhöndorf chapel since yesterday.
"We don't really think that (of course!)," they write on their yesterday accessible website.
"But we use this measure to attract your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than they seem.
Basically, we are firmly convinced that as Bad Honnefer citizens we know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The action involves more than "only" a logo and a slogan, it goes on to say.
"It is necessary to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city a distinctive unique feature".
Finally, it competes with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef can cost a medium five-digit sum for its new roof brand and the campaign.
Military Reforms in Turkey - Erdogans fear of the army
Every year at the beginning of August in Ankara, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirements and promotions in the officers' corps.
That's the way it is this week.
At first glance a normal process.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup.
The meeting was no longer held in the General Council building, as in the past, but in the Prime Minister's office.
Under the chairmanship of the Head of Government, the five Vice-Presidents as well as the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs also took part in the discussions.
The civilians in the YAS were thus overnumbered.
The government in the military attracts the reins.
Although Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, the commanders of the army, the Air Force and the Navy were disbanded.
Since the failed coup, Head of State Erdogan fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as a wire puller of the coup attempt.
486 people who are supposed to have been directly involved in the coup attempt are being negotiated in Ankara since this week.
The day after the coup, Erdogan had already referred to the attempt to overthrow him as a "gift of God" as he gave him the opportunity to "clean the armed forces completely".
But does Erdogan really control the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper Hürriyet published an article entitled "Unbehagen im Militär-Hauptquartier".
In the General Council there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which manifest themselves, among other things, in the lifting of the head cloth ban for soldiers, the paper wrote.
The large-scale cleansing of the army and the security forces goes on anyway.
In mid-July, Erdogan had another 7395 state servants fired, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.
It seemed that Erdogan had tamed the military.
The generals were considered earlier than the real masters of the country.
Three times they blamed themselves for their role as guardians of the secular state order.
After his election in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the military's power step by step, not least calling for reform of the European Union.
Former officers say that Erdogan is actively promoting the Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe" a nameless uncalled officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad, the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and Salafis" in a few years.
If this happens, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
In any case, there is doubt in the Alliance after the cleansings about the willingness to use the Turkish army.
Leadership structures and operational skills are "weakened", says Nato diplomats.
Washington amends the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
He foresees lowering legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, stricter rules for obtaining visas for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft law is to be discussed in the two Chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way the US spends on citizens from other countries Green Cards."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English, who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy," said Trump, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to clean track for racelift
The future of the race shuttle had always been disputed over the past few months - now it should be done very quickly.
Even before the end of the year, the route on which the tourist train runs is to be built.
In order to secure the future of the race shuttle in the long term, construction work on the route is to be started this year, according to the Ministry of Transport.
"With the decision to continue ordering and reorganising the Ilmenau race path, the country confesses to this important connection especially for tourism," said Transport State Secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
The cost of rehabilitating the route was about EUR 2.5 million.
Of this total, the country took over 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future, is currently being finalized, explained Sühl.
The Ministry and the South Thüringen Railway as operators had already agreed on the technical details.
"The timetable, the vehicles used and the quality standards are thus negotiated," said Sühl.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of 11 years.
This is to order the race ladder shuttle regularly on December 2017.
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a railway connection between the Ilmenau and Rennsteig railway stations, which is especially popular with tourists.
In recent months, during a pilot operation, it has been tested whether the route is used by enough people to order it regularly again in the future.
The track is also very buildable in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry about it.
Just as you thought it couldn't get any more crazy in 2017, a new report comes about the technological developments in the field of sex robots.
Yes, indeed.
Sex robots are a big deal at the moment.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharpy, professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take her ascent seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of nipples and the type of fingernail.
"People are making fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we will see them even more often," said Mr. Sharpy at the publication of his new report.
Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also choose his robot according to his convictions "adapting" and everything, from the robot's eye color to the shape of nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it will be even more disturbing, as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah", which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "apparent" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality as possible", the True Companion website is swarming.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods throughout the day - quite like real people!
She can be tired, have a conversation or she can be "in the mood"!"
There are many disturbing aspects to this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subdued female characteristics, the incitements to rape, if you take a step on Frigid (it is here: resisting) Farrah, worry one the most.
On his website, True Companion compared Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have a roxxxy?" it says on the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and their increasing refinement point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Of course, most men will not keep sex robots, and while the FRR notes their increasing popularity, they remain on the verge of consumer culture for the moment.
But what leaks out of the peripheral zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or insulting until they are allowed to do so by the free market.
There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging at a time when the rights of women worldwide are threatened, in which there is a President in the White House who has recommended to have sexually attacked women.
The most daunting aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Magd' report') is not the graphic images, the veiled bodies and the outstretched eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (even with pornstar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.
But, the point is, when it comes to their "personalities", the robots are not real women.
You can't separate from your companion or just leave.
They have no mediation or background history, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could interfere with the imagination of total subjection.
In other words, they are suitable slaves.
Or to express it in the 2017 speech: maids
Trump's great performance?
He makes Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a binsen wisdom of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the US election have also split families into small sizes.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving there were advice in the U.S. newspapers on how to deal with the horror of Trump’s relatives.
We all allegedly tighten to let our filter bubbles burst.
Less has been noticed the power of Trump to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has been working with Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kinship with which she had fought for decades because of politics, is suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side.
Around the dining table, this is certainly a good thing, but it is in a further context that this also entails significant risks.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the deterrent effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we're referring to the creepy possibility that his jokes will one day no longer repudiate us.
There is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" Republicans of the right wing, who suddenly appear as a notion of reason in comparison to his standards.
Today, I find myself in an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's primitive version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax statement looked like) - both of which, compared to Trump, are actually a very mild crime.
When Trump goes, the next Republican candidate only needs to be spiritually healthy to qualify for immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we took our children to the Central Park carousel, the largest carousel in the New York Park department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need coffee.
The horses are enormously large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are grumpy and the animals twist to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climbing music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: The views of high buildings are getting old, the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city does not satisfy the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a major roundabout in northern London.
However, the Central Park Carousel is still a strange magical experience, as here two two years old, one 11-year-old and two women in the 40s can go on and all have a great time.
If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but luckily no one asked.
On the other hand, this week I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.
In the coffee house at the corner of my street, it is the same, plus the option to compare the rating with a 15% drink money - this to buy something over the shop table.
This not only leads to a slowing down of what should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need exists.
The poor woman in the department store stood apologisingly grinning, while I tired of the experience of giving her my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to the hospital with chest pain
Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital for the treatment of cuts in his wrists, which he reportedly suffered from the prison authorities after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal from the prosecutors against a first death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he was holding his girlfriend for a night intruder hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to impose this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius Appell, of which they say she is too careless.
The National Criminal Enforcement Authority said that they would raise objections at the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the opposition could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk of his punishment being increased to 15 years when the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
As Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberger schools, the four-klässlers from Fützen and Epfenhofen were released during the holidays and in the secondary schools.
Three of the drop-out students will go to the gym, four to the real school in the future.
On Tuesday evening, headmaster Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Biesental Bürgerhaus in Epfenhofen.
The 29 students of the four classes headed by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder chose a young eagle to grow up in the chicken farm, but then to be released into freedom.
For this purpose, the merry band performed a musical titled "The Eagle in the Chicken Court".
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg, and had it hatched from his chickens.
Instead of a chicken, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making a chicken out of him broke, and the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain and disappeared.
After that, the classes three and four showed a chicken dance in the study of Yvonne Frank.
The hens danced with the young goggles that carried the cylinders around the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said headmaster Angelika Sitte.
The young animal is different from the other young animals (kitchens), but it belongs to it.
But he will never be like a chicken.
His determination was to be free.
She wished every four-letterer that he felt accepted in his new school.
The following was a thank-you word to the colleagues, the former headmaster Michael Müller, who keeps getting in on lessons, and the parents' representatives.
The chicken season is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
After two years of schooling, she let her students go away, for it would have been a really great time.
In the end, she could rely on the four-pieces.
Finally, all students heard a song of summer time and holiday time.
There was great joy among the children.
Eight first graders have already been registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by TV, reported.
On the morning of August 1st, a group of illegally camping people was arrested in Sithonia by the police, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day, they were released while currently under investigation.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported to bTV that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have tightened up control of the free camp and impose considerable fines on anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
The Ministry said that the court can impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What the affected need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the action?
The main questions and answers at a glance.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They aim to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars of the Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 emission classes.
Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanine from ACE Auto Club Europe gives estimates:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have foaming software," says Anja Smetanin.
Their retrofitting has been arranged by the Federal Road Agency (KBA).
How and from when are customers informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation over the next few months, but not yet a precise date.
Daimler has informed me that he is referring to every person concerned.
If an inspection is already carried out, it will be carried out within its framework.
How long should the overall upgrades go?
"Several to say," says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and on the political pressure.
"For we have seen that car manufacturers voluntarily do not yet act on the environment."
How long is the update supposed to take?
The upgrade itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It might be more time - consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who don't drive cars from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises to wait.
According to Smetanin, it is believed that foreign producers would move forward.
Is there any danger of a massive price drop in Euro-4 cars?
ACE fears this.
But in the regions where driving bans threaten.
In rural areas, there has so far been no loss of value for older diesels.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners does not want to come - from protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the prized awards from the renowned Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honoured.
The awards will be handed over at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, U.S. President Donald Trump will host a reception and join his wife Melania in the award ceremony.
The award winner, known with progressive TV series, Lear therefore already announced that he would refrain from participating in the gala.
The "New York Times" he said, "This presidency has decided to neglect the arts and human rights completely - even to deprive them of the means - and that burdens me."
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her view.
The Kennedy Center, named after former president John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Former winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbaumeister, will retire next year.
The job is already outsourced - suitable candidates, however, are rare.
Wacker has been a city architect for 31 years.
And the work still gives him great fun, as he conveys in the press conversation.
He reports of varied tasks but also demanding ones that await his successors.
At the same time, he wonders that no application has yet fulfilled the requirement profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.
Thus, taking into account the regular notice periods, there should be still enough time for inclusion.
Since Haslach acts as a subsidiary of the administrative community, the applicant must present appropriate conclusions.
Because this function definitely wants to keep the city.
If they could no longer fill them, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But proximity to the city and to itself is important, says Wacker, who reports on a good business environment and good mood between authority and citizens.
In more than 30 years in the office, some important projects have gathered that Wacker looks back on with pride.
"We make the city worth living," he is confident about the construction agency and its employees.
But also in the future, varied projects are on the agenda: for example, the transformation of the former Hukla area and Niederhofenparkplatz are under way.
The Kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, also the stadium renovation is still topic.
The latter alone will beat with about 1.5 million euros to be booked, "if we do it right," says Wacker.
"All in all, great tasks are waiting for my successors.
The work here is fun."
A large play area for a city builder is available in a static style.
With Haslach's own building yard and gardening, many things can be handled quite flexibly.
"One can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often praisedly mentioned by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town as an ensemble is under monumental protection, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in" when new buildings are approved, the discerning city architect emphasizes.
After all, the mayor has a high responsibility.
He's a builder, "in the end, everything runs over my table."
In the case of care and coordination, he can count on many years of employees: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been present for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Tiefbau) has been present for 15 years.
Also, that his successor remains for a long time, Wacker wishes: "We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place".
Continuity is important not only for a good operating climate but also for the further design of the city.
If you want to inherit Roland Wacker, you should be able to present a completed study as a diploma engineer or Bachelor with a field of architecture and have good expertise in the fields of construction planning and construction planning law.
The city building office is under construction and civil engineering, construction management planning, basic business matters, management of urban properties, urban farm with building yard and urban gardening, as well as Lower Law Office including monumental protection.
Bike thrown on lines: South railway track blocked
According to the police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway line transfer in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) on the lines.
They were so damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators go out of two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night.
A pink scooter and a bicycle driver had been observed near the scene of the crime.
"This goes far beyond a Lausbubenstrike," said ÖBB spokesperson Christoph Posch to the APA.
The perpetrator or perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and also put the train at risk.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the installation, the delay minutes and the costs of rail replacement transport, the railway customers could also pay off the perpetrators.
Overall, the speaker said that there was a "significant" sum.
The damage was fixed again on Friday afternoon, the railway on the southern railway line could be run without handicaps.
Nearly ten trains had been taken out on Friday morning, two of which involved long-distance transport.
Freight trains did not fail, but they were delayed.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, about 200 metres of overhead lines had to be exchanged.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable state, which affects about 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products in order to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestine are patrolling to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not enter the body.
Cells that are able to cause inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body, without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease.
In experiments it was found that there is a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their intestines.
And the bacterium requires Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a connection between a bacterial artery - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells".
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promote more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel disease when the same system also works in humans.
The postdoctoral doctor Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same strain, but which was separately housed, did not.
She suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbiomes of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastro-intestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were DNA sequenced and there were six bacteria found in the mice with the immune cells, but without them in the mice.
Mouses were raised in a sterile environment, so that they lacked a intestinal robot and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affected the immune system, researchers L. reuteri grew in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of fluid - without bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated by the mice.
The immune cells evolved into the tolerant cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of the Tryptophan metabolism known as indol-3-mic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastro-intestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan co-formulants from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said, "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
High tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can potentially lead to an extension of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed a "genie" with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United, Nemanja Matic signed a "genie", Jose believes Mourinho after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The 40 million pounds signature of Chelsea began with a 2:1 win in Dublin, the last preseason game, before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira shaped according to their preference.
However, Matic was excluded from the Blues' pre-Asian tour and managed only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he had to improve prior to the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him to be ready sooner than later."
Apart from Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started in the Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho formed his start XI for the beginning of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fanastic work" to fulfill three of his four priority new commitments.
"Get three out of four, I thank the club," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've made great efforts."
Boeing "painted" Dreamliner in the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots fled Seattle in Washington, Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette, Michigan, and moved in the form of a Dreamliner across the USA, which are several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute.
On the radar screens was to be the shape of a Dreamliner.
The whole thing was a endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had already made such advertising in the past.
Thus the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New low hit for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
How the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still head of the SPD, social-democratic Prime Minister before elections always looked to Berlin with some concern.
Only a stork from the party center, just no counterwind from the League - this was the most important desire of the electorate.
Since Martin Schulz has led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, employees from the Willy-Brandt-Haus have observed the events in the SPD-controlled state capitals with increasing horror.
What Schulz has got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described with counterwind in the approach.
It was low.
One by one.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Bundes-CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPDs and Greens.
"This shows once again: Red-Green simply cannot rule reliably," said CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber of the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprising appearance of a Green Member has plunged the Government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the land day election his red-green coalition thus lost its one-step majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The Green Federal Managing Director Michael Kellner has asked the apostate Green Party member Elke Twesten to return her mandate.
The transition to the CDU means a clear distortion of the electorate's will.
Every Twesten must immediately return their mandate," said the Federal Managing Director and election campaign leader of the Greens to the editorial network Germany (RND).
"That must not be true at all," sighs a SPD electoral fighter, when the new message of Job reaches the central party on Friday afternoon.
Stephan Weil, SPD-Minister-President of Lower Saxony, stands without a majority of the government after the Green MEPs have been replaced by Elke Twesten.
It is the preliminary culmination of a whole series of major and small crises in SPD country associations.
And no one knows what's next.
The Misere began with the unexpected significant defeat at the Saarland elections in March.
A blue eye, no more, calmed the comrades at the time.
After the national elections in Schleswig-Holstein and Nordrhein-Westfalen, everything will be different.
It was then – and everything became much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into twilight, the Düsseldorf Pleite skinned the party smoothly.
In the following weeks, the comrades were yelling at each other.
Then, when they had just created new courage, came the G-20 summit of Hamburg.
And with him came the next strike.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong head of the SPD, lost his Nimbus on that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning.
And because in post-crisis communication, he did pretty much everything wrong.
Since then, Scholz has fought for his political survival.
So now Stephan Weil.
Due to the VW exhaust gas business and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Dutch Prime Minister has been criticising for a long time.
Mises were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because of this, Because over the past few weeks has increasingly tried to put accents in the League.
The former mayor of Hanover's efforts to expand his power in Berlin were also not hidden in the area of Martin Schulz.
They allowed him to do so, as they promised that the party would be stabilized from time to time.
Now the exact opposite could occur.
Because of this, the parties are essentially not at fault with the Dutch-Saxon Greens.
And there's no Schulz.
Sometimes the comrades try to keep their own rows closed.
Your anger is focused on the Greens, and here, above all, on the apostate parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is unbearable and democratically damaging, as Mrs Twesten places her own career interests on the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, Head of the Party Left in the SPD Bundestag Group, the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten has not been elected to Parliament on behalf of her person as a direct candidate, but on the country list of the Lower Saxony Greens, so the Lower Saxony MEP continues.
The logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD Bundestag faction, lamented an "undemocratic maneuver".
"The electorate's will was clear four years ago: the people made Stephan Weil the Prime Minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Dutch SPD as a leading candidate in the Bundestag election, the RND.
"Now, the personal career thinking of a future CDU member is distorting the election result," Oppermann continued.
He asked to clarify the background.
I want to know if there has been more or if there has been further commitments from the CDU Lower Saxony.
Support funds for local core III
If you want to renovate your house over the years, you can soon get support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STAG informed about this development on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event Schindler gave a look back on the past.
Since 1991 there have been areas for renovation in Empfingen.
At that time, in the refurbishment area I from 1991 to 2004, the country of Baden-Württemberg still had two thirds of the funding.
In the 2005-2016 refurbishment area, the grant was still at 60 percent.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "successful project" - it was finally important also to promote internal development, and not just to open up new construction areas.
On 4 April, the government Bureau of Karlsruhe had received information that there would be a refurbishment area III.
The grant amounted to 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euros would be from the country, the rest of the municipality of Empfingen.
How is a refurbishment area created?
So Schindler continues to investigate where the "real old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role in renovating whether there is any interest in the planned area.
If necessary, the territorial boundaries could then be shifted again.
STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the federal-country program "Social City" in which the renovations would be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions, and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out in terms of objects, i.e. per plot.
Finally, the area of rehabilitation would be defined as the statutes.
The period of authorisation for the funding has been in force since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
However, until September of this year, the inventory would first be carried out, within which those involved in the refurbishment area will receive a questionnaire to be filled out.
In November or December, as far as possible, the Statute will be adopted so that the renovations can begin next year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the preliminary investigations.
It is about evaluating urban mishaps and deciding when to renovate and to what extent.
A renovation note is then added to the property in question.
Pietzschmann himself will come to Empfingen again and take a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that an essential success factor for the project was the involvement of the parties involved.
There will therefore be questionnaires that will be sent by post to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled in by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and land arch" in which it concerns, among other things, the building state and the restoration plans.
In the grey questionnaire, the "budget and apartment arc", information on the size, division and inhabitants of a living room can be made.
The blue "operator" sheet is only to be completed when the building operates business premises.
However, Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not an application for funding at the same time.
In addition, new construction measures were not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of funding according to the "Windhund principle" function - who comes first makes it first.
You can't reserve funding for later.
To conclude, photos of the project "Ortskern II" were shown in order to make the participants a refurbishment "savoury".
British inventor sets himself a microchip to come with a hand motion in the house and car
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so that he can open his door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He joined Dr. Geoff Watson, an advisory anaesthesist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards.
The technology resembles a cat and dogs implanted a microchip and takes only 30 seconds.
The company of Mr. Northam would also like to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, everything for a surcharge of £300 per castle.
The married father of one has now installed both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology, which begins when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House advertising costs the taxpayer thousands
The White House's decision to fly a Marine helicopter to South Lawn for an event that highlights American production last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000 according to the military's information left to the TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the President is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior white house officials made a tour of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was exhibited in addition to a yacht from Maine, a Wisconsin fire engine and a Mississippi forklift.
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, after the recordings of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this, because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superior, the Deputy Naval Commander for Aviation.
The message showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on July 17 at 7 a.m. for the event at 3 p.m. and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 18:00 and 21:00 that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, a second team would be needed for the return flight due to the restriction of duty hours.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the security staff of the unit remained on the ground during the time.
The records provided by the TIME did not show clearly whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
Data sets show that HMX-1 has asked if the event could violate the destination.
"A question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you're locked," the deputy commander replied.
The event "Made in America" was called an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But also official events have political overtones.
At the event, the President launched a reform of the health reform that was under way in the Senate, and he promoted efforts to curb government legislation.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.
But asking for their use only for a photo-OP is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February, when the President's aircraft performed taxi services against the background of its first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of reports that complain about the use of the President's aircraft by his predecessor.
"The White House is enthusiastic about the show "Made In America" - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials," said Lindsay Walters, Deputy Press Secretary of the White House.
HMX-1 crews often perform training flights in the area around Washington and in South Lawn to deflect the US President in the White House with precise centimetres.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 carried out 58 training landings at the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event included the need for flight crew training for the month, said one official.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours on this day for "non-presidencies support missions".
The White House said that taxpayers took over the burden for none of the other props presented at the event.
A spokesman from Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not have any budget records for President's flights, and it is difficult to identify the exact costs for the event.
However, according to the hourly rates of the US Department of Defense for the 2017 financial year, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is USD 24,380 per hour of flight.
The aircraft's flight time is recorded as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below this rate.
"The cost to taxpayers on the basis of reimbursement rates estimates is highly misleading," Walters said.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs, which are included in annual resources."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contract conclusion.
At this time, the former press spokesperson of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present things made in America this week," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands of people, are dependent on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight this."
It was not clear if Trump was interacting with the helicopter when he entered his tour over the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire engine.
In the White House Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."
TC BW Nose for tricky task
Top riders of the Second Tennis League join the table-driving Suchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Kiel at the tableendrite Suchsdorfer SV.
Despite five games still flawless balance sheet, the top rider of the Second Tennis League has gained the sense of reality.
Team chief Marius Zay certainly has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation.
Right on the rear positions, I find the team very good."
For class and stability at the Suchsdorfer SV, imports from the high north mainly take care.
"The Danes and Finns can even refer to stakes in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in double terms," says Zay with a view of Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"It's going to be hard for us, as always.
You also need a good portion of luck."
The Neusser team for the trip to the high north stands handy.
Maxime Janvier could make his debut for Blue-White.
If it is not the Bundesliga party currently active at the Challenger tournament in the Italian Biella, the Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic) playing at the tournament in the Czech Liberec will be the first in this season.
The previously unbeatable Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was still at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel at the ball yesterday with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski.
He was supposed to be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both the Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two wins last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could also return to the team again.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was still the number one of the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the training staff around Marius Zay fills up the cadre.
How America can harm the OMV
Actually, Donald Trump was not happy when he signed the law on the tightening up of sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening.
"In his duty to legislate," he said, "the Congress had wrapped up a few "unconstitutional rules".
The Moscow reaction was also as sharp as expected, and even Brussels was foaming against the US advance.
After all, the proposal provides for punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Since then, investors of the local OMV, which together with other European companies co-finance the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Line Nord Stream 2, have been alarmed.
The threatening scene is huge.
Nevertheless, it was too early for an assessment of the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil group.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life through executive orders.
Twelve weapons are his choice.
"The press" has looked at which the group could defend itself and which could really hurt him.
Narcos Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel in the hotline of Netflix is put to the centre
Despite the second season of Narcos, which Pablo Escobar's killer reveals, Netflix's series is not over for a long time.
The seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service, the first one received their first trailer and showed the latest villains of the show.
With the third season, the DEA has focused its attention on the world's richest organization of drug trafficking: the Cali cartel.
led by four powerful sponsors, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more government bribery and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly published trailer Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the type, the American and Colombian law enforcement authorities invite to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whalen, Miguel Angel Newestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on 1 September.
Role backward: The city employs 46 kitchen helpers
The city organizes the Kita lunch table itself again.
With firm contact partners for the children and a assignment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the urban day care centers.
On 1 September the city of Krefeld takes over the food supply in the urban day care facilities (Kitas) in its own direction.
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Head of the Youth Assistance Department, this is a good news: "We were all very pleased".
Still being cooked outside the house: A caterer takes over this task and supplies freshly cooked.
The city operates in the Krefeld area 46 day care centers, in 44 children are given a warm meal at lunchtime.
In the past Kita year, 2,800 children were sitting at the tables, and the need is growing steadily.
"In the meantime, not only do children who are cared for 45 hours a week eat in Kita at noon," explains Pommeranz.
"The offer also applies in the 35-hour care if children stay up to 14 o'clock."
46 part-time workers have from September 1st kitchen service: They warm up the supplied food, supplement it with salad, raw food and fruit, serving the meal individually, giving the food out, clearing off, washing and cleaning the kitchen.
"The employees are permanently assigned to a kita," says Pomeranianz.
The size - there are two groups as well as seven groups of institutions - decides on the length of hours.
"The kitchen helpers now belong firmly to the Kita team," says Pomeranianz.
"So they are much more involved and it is easier to implement pedagogical concepts for kita management".
It is also a question of healthy nutrition and cooking.
"The children are supposed to help prepare the food."
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team made sense.
Also for the children.
"They have a known force in the Kita, a person who is familiar to them, and not constantly changing people".
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has, in addition to improving the quality of the kitchen service, also the charm that it has shown itself to be the most economical in comparison between self-regulation and external procurement for the city, the Press Office says.
And that, although 46 part-time forces are re-adjusted.
"But these hours are not as heavy as those in the education area for about 750 people," says Sonja Pomerananz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, Head of Mission of the United Nations, said that hundreds of women will compete in the Council elections in the provinces. Three women are candidates for the role of Vice-President and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said on Wednesday in a statement.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are included in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban have released threats to an election process that coincides with the transition from international combat to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will peacefully hand power over from a democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said that a strong role for women will still strengthen Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of 3.6 million voters.

Men try to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 were supposed to have tried on Thursday to rob a 13-year-old girl.
According to information from the police, the men spoke to the 13-year-olds who stayed on Kolping Street with friends, about 2:55 p.m. because they wanted to call the girl's cell phone.
The 13-year-old rejected the request and continued with her friends.
Then one of the perpetrators tried to grab the girl's cell phone and necklace, but what was missing.
The duo fled without any spoils.
The two young men could later be arrested by the police.
The investigation is in progress.
GMB concern about investment in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A trade union would like to make sure that the long-term commitment to production in its Glasgow plant is assured by managers of the Biskuit manufacturer McVitie.
GMB Scotland said that the company had hovered about the future of investments in the Tollcross location.
More than 500 employees work in the factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies in addition to other products.
McVity's owner Pladis said he's invested more than five million pounds in recent years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would be "experienced first" if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB asked McVitie's to "remember that funding for the modernisation of production lines will not be advanced".
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we cannot gain a clear understanding of the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross from the general site manager concerns our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the labour force has concentrated heavily on the local community and the Greater Glasgow, an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, under the perspective of jobs, wages and wealth, and against the background of Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flourishing production presence at McVitie".
Pladis' spokesperson said: "The branch manager at Tollcross only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will react directly to this, since we appreciate the continuous engagement of employees and union representatives.
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with our employees that we, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and insecure economic climate, constantly review our business – and this applies to all our business areas and locations – in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross location, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a production site. Should our operations change at the site, the employees and their union representatives will be the first to learn about this."
Has the PSG warned Barcelona three years ago about Neymar?
The side of La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verratti
In their persecution of Neymar, Paris Saint-Germain will not abandon Neymar after she has made an offer of £ 189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of the world record attack?
The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for 89 million pounds in the past season.
After the end Neymar becomes the world’s most expensive player and the world’s most paid professional sportsman. PSG offers wages of more than GBP 500,000 per week.
Barcelona is angry at the way Neymar forced his way outside, although a source near the Catalan Executive Board insists that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned by the PSG president about this prospect three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaif had a strong warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, we will stand in opposition to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaif.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, this will have consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International to leave Italy under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its prize offers for Neymar.
Roller overturned and damaged
On the night from Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately threw a scooter in the Königsfelder Straße in front of the property number 30 and so set up on the disguise of the vehicle property damage of over 200 euros.
Police Schramberg, telephone 07422/27 01-0, asks for clues.
In an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese, the police are looking for witnesses.
The driver of a VW Touran had to avoid a car on his driveway and touch the main plank.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccam with his VW was on the B 215 from Stolzenau on the way to Leesee.
In the area of the surrounding area of Stolzenau, he met a car on his lane, so that he had to turn right.
The Touran driver was in touch with the guideboard.
Damage to property was caused by the car.
The driver of the arriving car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the road accident.
It may be good, according to the accident victim, that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police now ask witnesses of the incident and the driver of the car to contact the commissioner in Stolzenau under Tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen-Report Unloaded Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse cases relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger.
This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Cathedrals continues to provide discussion.
Christian Weisnder, spokesperson of the Reform movement "We are Church", explained after publication to the German press agency, he expected an apology from the former Regensburg Bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the cathedral chaplain Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of Emerited Pope Benedict XVI.
It would be very useful for the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret at their own omissions or at the time misapprehension of the proceedings.
On the other hand, the Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano" criticised the fact that the reporting of violence in the cathedrals is "two-dimensional".
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that they are "deployed and shameful acts" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future, but it is obvious that the "degree of media manipulation" is the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian bioethics committee.
"The habit of describing the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of the everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to hold it normal," writes Scaraffia.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said in an interview with the Bavarian Radio: "You like to go to the church and that's a found meal."
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth "beats were a normal pedagogical remedy" "to get done with cheeky children, as I was one thing."
It found it unfair to apply current standards to earlier decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports on the abuses, Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger also often appeared.
Completely unjust, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the volume "My Brother of the Pope" with Ratzinger (translated in 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he appreciates the results of the final report.
What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, who was appointed by the Diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightenment?
A total of 547 Regensburg cathedrals were "high plausibility" victims of assaults between 1945 and the early 1990s, 67 cathedrals were sexually abused.
The final report says of Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary, it can therefore be noted that cathedral chaplain R. used in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence.
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe.
Nevertheless, unlike many other accused people, many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with him despite violence".
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal against the Regensburg judges Georg Ratzinger in his opinion relieves him.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "Accomplishment of violence against the protected persons in the Regensburg Cathedrals", gives a contradictory picture of Domkappelmeister Georg Ratzinger.
For one thing, many students highlight his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears to be a choleric and perfectionist, who became the generalist when a domspatz did not provide a musically top performance.
How do you view this final report as his biography?
Michael Hesemann: If you make the effort and read the whole 440 pages of the report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is found in it.
He is only dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly acquitted by any suspicion of complicity or co-confidence in the horrific cases of sexual abuse.
The excess of violence at preschool also occurred outside its sphere of action.
At any rate, he may be accused of being too late or of not having taken first indications seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was felt by virtually all respondents as - so literally - "Salvation", "Heaven" and "Better World".
For example, the broad majority of his student Georg Ratzinger presents an excellent witness, describes him as "hot-hearted", "popular", "righteous", "competent" and " understandingly", as an extremely kind teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and was "always surrounded by grapes from children".
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which has already led to an outbreak of anger.
Not only did he bang chairs and throw the keychain on the ground, but he also drew the earfucking and all too cheeky boys to his hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.
However, it must be said to his credit that such methods of education were widespread in the period in question, in the 1960s and 1970s, with parents and teachers.
Do you also know such breeding methods?
Of course, I think each of us was born before 1968.
I also experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
Compared to what is actually involved in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at preschool, these are, of course, Bagatelles.
One wonders whether it has to do with his acquaintance and role as Brother of Benedict XVI, that many media just fell upon him.
Many who have never understood him still work hard on the Bavarian Pope.
But the truth is, the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
In the media, a great deal has been reported in the context of the report on abuse in the Regensburg Cathedrals.
In the final report, is Georg Ratzinger also burdened with any involvement or involvement in sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly no.
None of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have trusted the Cathedral Master.
Not even the parents were dedicated.
"I never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it," said one interested person on behalf of the others, "it was all very embarrassing to me."
The real problem in clearing up sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent out of shame.
If they did not even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators professionally.
How, then, do the judges-students assess the role of Ratzinger in relation to the abuses?
Michael Hesemann: A student asked it this way: "With regard to sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrator.
I think it ... is also really absurd to assume that he has been calculated ... Buben has been more intrusive, clearer or more open than with their parents, boarding officers, teachers of trust etc.
Talking to him about sex... unthinkable."
Thus, the report comes to the very clear conclusion: "The fact that students and/or their environment were entrusted to him in advance could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation".
So, as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is free to speak freely of every fellow believer.
Nor can it be accused of not preventing him or of bringing him to the fore.
There is no reason, therefore, to link his good name with these vile crimes, as has unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media a lot of "waltexesses" was to be read at the Regensburg Cathedral Pastels.
The former court chaplain Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "Wegschauen".
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and blended into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violent excesses and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that, in turn, is an abuse of the report.
There is a clean separation: between the preschool and the high school of the cathedrals, between sexual abuse and violent excesses, as well as, we say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents of the period since 1945, that is also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir leader of the cathedral patrols.
The whole terrible pruning pedagogy, the cases in which boys were really harassed and painted by sadistic teachers and suffered from them horrendous, all occurred at the preschool in Aitzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But they had nothing to do with Domkappelmeister Georg Ratzinger, for he only got the boys to face when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.
On that was, as most witnesses stress, the topic of "preschool".
One was only happy to have escaped you and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.
What else was at the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but no sadistic violence.
And that also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases despite violence, even combine positive memories with him".
That is how the accusation of having looked away remains.
Despite all the efforts, however, the report was able to define only two periods in which he was reported on the preschool conditions.
The first time in 1970/71, when he began to establish himself and wanted to hear nothing (so the witness) from the predecessors at a school where he did not work and was responsible (so the witness) and then only about 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears before the states?
Michael Hesemann: No, for in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In this he points out to them that "punishment is still being practised in the preschool".
In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended that urgent action be taken.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when criminal punishments had long been banned in Bavaria.
Before that, they occurred in a legal horror zone, as each one of us probably knows.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where the people concerned might have been exaggerated or dramatized and where the permitted limit had actually been exceeded.
But you can't say that he always looked away.
That's just not true.
It was only in 1980 that the criminal punishment at schools was abolished officially in Bavaria.
Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to the time at the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We Historians are talking about the "Fallstrick of Anachronism", that is, the danger of evaluating past according to today's moral standards.
That's right for the princess.
But this does not apply, of course, to sexual abuse, which was horrific at all times, nor to what was broken in preschool by resistance and violence to innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond what was common at that time.
It's all awful and I'm glad it's finally being worked out.
But at the same time, I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all that had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, i.e. to draw ears and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then banned, he also adhered strictly to it.
What picture of his Regensburg era did Georg Ratzinger give in the discussions with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?
Did the issue of criminal punishment also come to mind?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book deals with the life of his brother Joseph, thus Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, since the cathedrals played only a side role.
Nevertheless, I do not hide the fact that he was leading a strict regiment there.
But this too must be said once again: without this perfectionism, without the demand for essential discipline, it would not have been possible for him to form an institution of world rank from the previously nationally known Regensburg Cathedrals, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With biscuits and bonuses alone, you don't make out of obscene boys once again big singers and stand before every success, in any area, but always discipline, passion and self-conquering.
As a human being, did you experience Georg Ratzinger talking to her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and again as wonderful, humorous, foundational, deeply believing and hearty people, from whom one cannot imagine that he could also do something wrong with a fly.
I regularly get along with how many former cathedrals still today, 23 years after his retirement, keep in touch with him regularly, visit him, read him out - he's almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.
Those who do not forgive him to this day that he was once strict with them are thus clear in the minority.
Most cathedrals are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them to the world of music.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a loving respecter, to whom they are still looking up and worshiping them.
And please, once again quite clearly: all that is expected of him are methods of education that were on the agenda at that time.
We can be glad we've been over this time for a long time.
But it is most unfair to make a man, just because he is prominent and has one even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat.
There's the evil intention that's behind it, just too obvious.
For the report that has just been published relieves him.
Now would be the time for a 93-year-old man who has gained great profits and would probably not be able to leave the Regensburg cathedrals in peace without those outside Bavaria and perhaps even Germany.
