Many stewards are concerned that they are "looking like fools"
Some councillors propose to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Congress).
Concerns have arisen as a result of plans to change the Council’s name to the congress.
The stewards of all classes are concerned that this could make them ridicule.
One employee member said that his team was concerned that “it is nuances to Twp and Pwp. ”
For readers living outside Wales: in German, twp means stupid and pwp means fornication.
A member of the Plaid Cymru group said that the group as a whole was “unsatisfied” and made other suggestions.
A member of the wealthy maintenance team said that his class had a “open mind” about the change in name, but pointed out that there was no significant difference between the words MWP and Muppet (flon).
In this context, it can be stated that the whisker w is carried as much as u in Icelandic.
The council, which is now working on the law to present the name - changes, said: “The final decision on all the names of the members of the council will, of course, lie with the members themselves. ”
The Law of Wales (The Government of Wales Act 2017) gave the Belgian Council the power to change its name.
In June, the Council published the results of public opinion polls, which showed great support for calling the council the “False Parliament. ”
With regard to the government’s title, the WMP (Welsh Parliament member) elected a member of the board, while MWP had the greatest support from the public in the polls.
According to reports, other suggestions are now being made by the administrators, but it may be difficult to reach agreement with the chairman of the council, Elin Jones, who is to submit a bill for the changes within a few weeks.
It will also include other changes in the way the Board works, including rules on the removal of the board members and the organization of the committee system.
Government officials will be able to pay final votes for their title when discussions about the bill begin.
The Macedonians vote in elections for a change of name on the land
The electors will vote on Sunday as to whether to change the name of their country to the ‘North Macedonia People's Republic’.
This case was voted in an attempt to resolve decades of conflict with the neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
For a long time, Athens has claimed that its neighbours’ names in the north are equivalent to their demands on its territory and have often objected to their requests for EU and NATO membership.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who disagrees with the vote on the change of name, has said that he will not view the elections as valid.
The vote, including the Prime Minister of Zoran Zaev, has, however, said that the change in name is simply the price that needs to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
Church bells of St. Martin's sounds are difficult for churches in Harlem
“ The older people I’ve talked to said that before, there was a bar and a church on every corner of the street, ” said Adams.
"Today there is neither."
He said that it is understandable that we should have fewer weights.
He said, "People have other ways of meeting."
"Bars are no longer the hubs of the neighborhood where people come together regularly."
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money that proceeds from the sale of property will not last as long as leaders expect “and sooner or later they will return to their place of origin. ”
He added that potential churches would be replaced by homes full of people who would not help save the nearby jobs.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and will therefore speed up the permanent closure of these churches, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move in these buildings will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became the center of the Black Metropolitan Community in 1870, and the St. Martin’s church in the decade later.
In the 1930 ’ s, the original white Methodist congregation moved away.
The congregation of black men who had served in the vicinity covered the building.
The Dark people’s congregation took over St. Martin’s church under the direction of Father Johns Howard Johnson, who had the initiative to shun shoppers on 125th Street, Harlem’s main shopping street, who yearned to recruit or give them promotions.
The building was seriously damaged by fire in 1939, but members of the congregation of Father Johnson planned to rebuild it and also let it build the clock.
Father David Johnson, son and successor to Father Johnson, proudly called the watchman “the clock of the poor. ”
The expert who played on the clock game in July called it a different name: “Humanity treasure ” and “a unique historical instrument. ”
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first clock game in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved over to the larger clock game in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin had no one else in his place.
In the past few months, many architects and architects have taken their way to St. Martin, some hired by church leaders, and others from the Episcopal period.
The Church Council, which oversees the visit and is appointed as church leaders, wrote the Episcopal Episcopal Assembly in July, expressing its concern that the Episcopal State “would seek to face the cost ” of the church council, even though it had not contributed to the council of the architects and contractors sent by the Episcopal Church.
Some parishioners complained about a lack of transparency on the part of the Episcopal Episcopal Church.
Shark hurts a 13-year-old boy who dived for hump in California
According to the authorities, a shark attacked a 13 - year - old boy and wounded him on Saturday when the boy was diving for humming in California on the first day of the lobster fishing season.
The attack took place just before 7 o’clock in the morning near the beach of Beacon’s Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy yelling for help and then rushing over with a group of others to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought that it was only a thrill to have reached the mood, but then “it became clear to him that the boy cried out:“ I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
All the bones of him were ripped up," said Hammel about what he saw when he came to the boy.
“ I cried out to everyone to get out of the water, “There’s a shark in the water! ”
The boy was transferred by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is seriously injured.
The type of shark that attacked the boy is unknown.
At a media meeting, the Coast Guard’s chief Larry Giles said that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but he was not of a more dangerous type of shark.
Giles added that the victim had suffered serious damage to the upper body.
The authorities closed the beach access from the Ponto Beach beach in Casablad to Swami’s beach in Encinitas for 48 hours, for study and safety.
Giles said that over 135 different types of sharks are in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plan to take up a field of beauty markets in Britain
Sainsbury’s team is going to compete with Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with a shopping center style and specialist staff.
This is part of a plan to enter the bathroom facilities market in Britain, which is worth 2.8 billion pounds and is growing as sales of fashion and home goods are decreasing. Larger cleaning containers are tested in 11 stores across the country and will be placed in more shops next year if well.
The investment in cosmetics is part of a large - scale process of using a multi - door shutter that was previously used by television sets, microwaves, and household items.
Sainsbury’s claim is that it is intended to double its cosmetics selection in up to 3000 product types, including for the first time the brand names such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current products from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also have increased space with marked areas similar to those found in the stores such as Boots.
The store is also going to start reselling its boutique beauty selection so that the majority of the lips are vegan-friendly, but the younger consumers demand it more and more.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop will test a warehousing in two shops of Sainsbury’s, the first one opened in Croydon in southern London last week and the next one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Networking and increased consumer inclinations to buy small amounts of food daily in the neighborhoods mean that a large market needs to work more to get people to come to their homes.
Mike Coupe, Managing Director of Sainsbury’s, said that the trades would be more and more like shopping centres when the chain tries to fight against the low-cost shops of Aldi and Lidl with more services and goods than food.
Sainsbury’s has placed Argos camps in hundreds of stores and has also announced numerous Habitat stores since the purchase of both chains two years ago. According to them, it has increased sales and made the purchase more profitable.
The first attempt to revive the shop to its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury’s tried to cooperate with Boots around 2000, so due to differences in how to share the proceeds of the sale of medicinal products in the supermarket.
The new policy comes after Sainsbury’s sale of its 281 drugstores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical companies, amounted to 125 million pounds three years ago.
According to the policy, Lloyds will have a role in these plans by adding a large selection of luxury skin marks, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, market manager of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have completely changed our look on our bathroom shelves to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in special training for staff who will be within the scope of advice.
Our product selection is designed to meet all needs. Charming environments and comfortable locations make us an exciting beauty store that transforms old shopping habits."
Peter Jones 'eternalism' after Holly Willoughby's retirement from 11 million pounds of contract
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, became “eternal” after the TV viewer Holly Willoughby terminated an 11 million-pound contract with his company to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home items and items, Truly.
The company had been likened to Goop, the brand Gwyneth Paltrow.
Thirty - seven - year - old Willoughby announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left Peter Jones, the star from Dragons’ Den, behind with a painful forehead by quitting participation in a popular lifestyle company at the last moment to focus on new and rewarding contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones, reports, has been “evidenceful” at a difficult meeting on Tuesday at his headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, when the TV lady accepted her popularity she did not have enough time for the Truly home and follow - up mark because of the new contracts worth up to 1.5 million pounds.
The company has been likened to Goop, the brand Gwyneth Paltrow, and was designed to double Willoughby’s properties, but their estimated value is 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37, announced to Instagram that she was going to withdraw from Truly, Jones flew from Britain to stay in one of her many summer homes.
A source reported: “Truly was a long way off on Holly’s priority list.
This was to be her future task, which would be accomplished by her for the next two decades.
Her decision to quit completely opened everyone up.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday; it was so short that the line went on the market.
There's a full stock of lips at Marlow's headquarters that are ready to sell."
Experts believe that the removal of This Morning, which is among the most popular stars in Britain, can cost millions for the company due to large warehouse fittings, ranging from pads and candles to clothing and household items, and possibly further delays in the sales of the product line.
This could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the three children of his mother, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been friends of Jones and Töra Capp, his wife, for decades.
Willoughby, together with Capp, founded Truly in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined the chairman of the board in March.
Couples spend 40 percent of their summer vacations in Baldwin, a company that produces television.
Willoughby will be the official representative of the M&S trade mark and will replace Ant McPartlin as the I'm a Celebrity participant.
A source named Jones said last night: “We don’t want to say anything about his business. ”
“And then we fell in love ”
He ignored the criticism he received from the media, for saying something that many would think inappropriate for the president, and for being so positive to the leader of North Korea.
Why has President Trump left so much?
Trump said and echoed a reporter's voice.
'I have left nothing behind'.
He noted that Kim was interested in another meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a big step towards the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
On the other hand, talks about nuclear disarmament have stopped.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, the main ambassador of North Korea, told international leaders at the General Assembly of the United States on Saturday that the north had not received an "adequate response" from the United States at the first steps of North Korea towards nuclear disarmament.
He said that instead, the United States continued its business efforts to maintain pressure.
Trump was all the more positive in his meeting talk.
"We meet with North Korea a great deal," he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
Now our relationship is great."
He said that his attempts to improve Kim’s relationship had brought about positive results — missile tests had stopped, hostages had been released, and the remains of American soldiers were returned home.
He also spoke to Kim about his relationship with him.
“It’s so easy to behave like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into a crowded stadium, there were only 200 people standing there,” said Trump, pointing out the crowd in front of him.
River waves and earthquakes in Indonesia cause great damage to the island, hundreds have perished
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, an international relief organization was told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok had to flee from their homes, an emergency situation was not declared, but it is essential that the international community can have relief activities there.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it clear that they are not going to ask for assistance from international organisations, so that this is difficult,” said Mr. Sumbung.
Although the Society Save the Children are putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain when foreign relief workers can work in the area.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Office, said that the situation in Palau was being evaluated by Indonesian authorities to see if the international community should be allowed to assist in the relief work.
Considering the frequency of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is sadly poorly prepared to protect its natural forces.
The flood waves have been built in Aceh, but they are rarely seen on other shorelines.
It seems that the lack of flood defence whistles in Palu still increased the rate of death, even though a warning was issued.
Even in the best of circumstances, traveling between the many islands of Indonesia can be challenging.
Natural disasters make planning even more complicated.
An infirmary who has sailed at the port of Lombok to shelter that the victims of the earthquake are now on their way to Palau, but it will take at least three days to get to the new location of the accident.
President Joko Widodo made it the main feature of his campaign to improve the downside of Indonesia’s traffic and has invested a lot of money in roads and railroads.
However, lack of funds has plagued Mr. Joko’s government, but elections will be held next year.
Mr. Joko also has to contend with an ongoing tension between religious groups in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative religion.
Over a thousand people had to leave their homes when the Christian and Muslim groups fought in the streets with swords, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge, player Liverpool, equals Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge rescued Liverpool from losing his battle against Chelsea in the precinct by scoring for 89 minutes on Saturday at the Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a shipment from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from Chelsea's target when his team was under 1-0.
He rolled the ball to the left and then tried to target the far pole.
The ball flew high above the target and toward its right corner.
Finally, the ball went over Kepa Arrizabalaga, who jumped up, and into the net.
“I just wanted to try to get into this position, to catch the ball, and players like Shaq always play it as far as possible so I tried to create as much time as I could,” said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante come and touch once and not think so much about it, but just took the shot.”
Chelsea was over 1-0 in half after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in 25 minutes.
On the visit, Chelsea, the candidate, handed the ball to Mateo Kovacic, and then spread from the middle to Liverpool.
Kovacic made the ball move fast between the center.
Then he sent the ball forward, and sent Hazard in for a suit.
Hazard ran away and scored to the distant corner with a left leg shot at Alisson Becker, Liverpool’s goalkeeper.
Liverpool is playing against Naples in the preliminaries at 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea is playing against Videoton in UEFA, Europe, at 3 p.m., Thursday in London.
The number of dead increases to 832 after a flood in Indonesia
The number of deaths caused by earthquakes and floods in Indonesia has increased to 832 as reported by the National Disaster Agency early on Sunday.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman of the Institute, said at a press conference that a number of people had been buried when buildings collapsed in the earthquake that took place on Friday and were 7.5 points on the Richter scale.
The city of Pala, with over 380,000 inhabitants, was devastated by buildings that had collapsed.
The police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has been started after a woman’s body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman with a stab wound was found at 7:55 this morning near Grayson Mews on John Street and a 32-year-old was arrested, suspected of murder.
Police have encouraged people in the area to submit if they saw or heard anything.
A researcher named Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is right, but I want to ask all those in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead to contact us if they saw or heard anything suspicious.
Also, I would like to ask everyone, especially a taxi driver, who might have taken a picture of his car cameras to contact us, because they could have important information for our research."
The police officer has confirmed that the woman who died lived in Birkenhead and that she was found inside an apartment.
In the afternoon, people who thought they knew the woman have come to ask where she was found this morning.
The study continues, and police say they are working to let the immediate victims know.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews tried to get back to his apartment, but police told him that no one could come into the building or leave it.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
People have now been told that many hours could go by until they can go back inside.
A police officer heard a man say that the whole area was now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman came to the scene.
She continues: “This is so terrible. ”
At 2:00 p.m., there were two police cars inside the marked area of the police station and one car just outside.
The number of police officers stood within the marked area and watched the residential buildings.
Anyone who could have any information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the crime scene on the phone 0800 555 111 and give the number 247 from September 30.
Shortening the British Congress of Cromwell is the newest memorial accused of 'rewriting history'
The ban of the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban destruction of the Puritan leaders in so many of England’s cultural and religious jewels.
The Cromwell Company, on the other hand, said that Mr Crick's suggestion was 'few' and 'an attempt to rewrite history'.
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the discussion over the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be beaten.
The English civil war against cultural symbols was neither an order nor a Cromwell’s execution.
Perhaps wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed before his forefather Thomas of the century before.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, marks the 19th century period and is part of a story that many believe still deserve praise.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is counted by many, perhaps late in the 19th century rather than today, as the guardian of the Congress against external pressure, in his case of the monarchy.
Whether this description is entirely correct is still a historical issue.
However, it is obvious that the conflicts that occurred in the mid - 17th century have shaped our people’s evolution and that Cromwell is a known person who represents one side of their struggle.
It is worth homageing and remembering his accomplishments as the Protector of the Kingdom."
Pigs attack the Chinese farmer and kill him
Pigs attacked a Chinese farmer and killed him on the market in southwestern China, according to local news.
The man, named only by his last name, "Yuan", was found dead with a broken artery and covered blood near a styria on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou region, as reported by the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject a vaccine into a pig styria on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai, China.
He had traveled with his uncle from neighboring Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that the door to the nearby pig styrofoam was open.
He said that inside there had been a large glare with a bloody mouth.
According to the report, a trial confirmed that the 250 kg boar killed the farmer.
"My uncle's feet were bloody and wounded," said the uncle, with the last name "Wu", at the Guiyang Evening News Office.
A security camera took Yuan to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his uncle.
The market owner told Evening News that the pig had been locked up so that no one else could be attacked while police were collecting evidence on the ground.
According to news, Yuan’s family and the market owners have discussions on how to compensate for his death.
There are rare cases of pigs attacking people.
In 2016, a woman and her husband were attacked by a pig on their property in Massachusetts and seriously injured the man.
Ten years earlier, a 30 - pound [300 kg] pig clamped a pig farmer on a tractor until his wife dragged the animal away.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but blood can arouse aggressiveness in them.
“They’re just playing.
They'd like to be happy and curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them the respect that belongs to them," he said.
The remnant of the hurricane of Rosa has a great deal of impact on the southwestern part of the United States
As foretold, the hurricane’s strength is decreasing as it crosses the cooler sea at the northern shore of Mexico.
On the other hand, Rosa will produce a great deal of results that could result in floods in northern Mexico and southwestern America in the days to come.
On Sunday, at 5 a.m., on the east coast of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, he became a class 1 hurricane, with a wind force of over 600 km [13 km] per hour, and he was located over 600 km [600 km] southwest of Punta Eugenia.
It is estimated that Rose is heading north on Sunday.
At the same time, the formation of the Pacific Ocean will move east to the west coast of the United States, and when Rosa arrives at the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, a large tropical rocket will follow northward into the southwestern part of the United States.
Rose will follow up to 25 cm in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical flakes will mix with the lower part that approaches and produce a large and large expanse over the southwest part in the days to come.
Locally 2.5 to 10 cm output can cause dangerous rapid flows, soil movement and possible steps in the desert.
A lot of heat-breeding will cause up to 5 to 10 cm of output in an hour in some places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected that up to 5 to 10 cm of the result will be found in some locations in the southwest, especially in the largest Arizona state.
There is a possibility of rapid flooding with rapidly worsening conditions because of the spread of tropical rain.
People are strongly advised to avoid walking into the desert when tropical rain is at risk.
A great amount of rain can turn the goads into rushing rivers, and thunderstorms can lead to rushes and duststorms.
The medicine approaching will carry local discharges in certain areas at the shoreline of Southern California.
There is a possibility of more than 1 cm of resolution that could cause small movements on the soil and rungs on the roads.
This is the first occurrence of the region during the rainy season.
A few scattered tropical showers will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, before the rash spread across a larger area late on Monday and Tuesday.
A great deal of results will spread over four states on Tuesday and end on Wednesday.
Much heat changes are expected in October everywhere in the United States, as the Arctic region is cooling, but the tropical is still somewhat warm.
At times, this can cause a great deal of heat over short distances.
A very good example of a marked temperature change was seen in the central United States on Sunday.
There's almost 7 degrees temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the next few days, persistent summers will try to build up and disperse again.
It is expected that a large part of the central and eastern parts of the United States will warm the beginning of October with a temperature of about 25 degrees or more from the plains of the south to the northeast.
The temperature could rise to 25 degrees [25 ° C] in New York City on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees Fahrenheit [6 ° C] above the average.
Our long - term forecasts indicate that the average temperature in the eastern United States in the early part of the month of October is high.
Over 20 million people were interviewed by Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people watched the thrilling testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, a nominated Supreme Court judge, on Tuesday, and the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual adultery that was to take place in the 1990 ’ s, and the witness was broadcast on six different channels.
At the same time, the political petition continued, and television stations suspended a regular program to publish the latest news on Friday: Jeff Flake, a Arizona Senator, presented a bill for the FBI to investigate the allegations for one week.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she was confident that Kavanaugh had drunk her and tried to strip her off at a school party.
Kavanaugh, in an emotional testimony, said that he was confident that it had not happened.
It is likely that more people watched the trial than the 20.4 million that Nielsen reported to have watched Friday.
The company measured the average viewing of the TV channels CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not available immediately for other television channels that showed the interviews, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen is also usually in trouble to measure the audience in the office.
To put this into context, this audience is similar in size to that of a final football game or the Oscar Prize Festival.
According to Nielsen, most people watched the interviews that took all day, on Fox News Channel, or 5.69 million.
ABC was second with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
After the trial, there was still much interest.
Flake was the focal point of the ball game on Friday.
After the office of this congressman of the Republica group announced that he would vote for Kavanaugh in favor, CNN and CBS took pictures of the protestors calling on him on Friday morning, when he tried to enter the elevator to get a meeting of the Judicial Committee.
He stood down for a few minutes while shame rained on him on the live broadcast at CNN.
One woman said: “I am standing right in front of you. ”
"Do you think he is telling the truth?"
People said to him: “You have authority while so many women are without authority. ”
Flake said that his office had issued a statement, and before closing the elevator door, he said that he would express himself more at the committee meeting.
The Kapal and TV stations all had direct broadcasts later when the Judicial Committee decided whether Kavanaugh's nomination should be forwarded to the Senate.
Flake said that he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the appointed ones next week, but a minority of Democrats have urged.
After a conversation with a friend named Chris Coons, Senator of the Democratic Party, Flake became convinced in part.
Flake made his decision after talking to Coons and some other senators thereafter.
Flake’s vote changed because it was evident that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the study.
President Trump has given permission to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, accuses critics of 'being in a political game' for Brexit
During an interview with The Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to step out of the European Union to "be in a political game" about the future of Britain and undermine its interests.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, will be attending the Advisory Group Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, September 29, 2018.
In another interview, published next to her interview on the cover page, Boris Johnson, her former foreign minister, was granted the so-called Chequers plan on Brexit and said that the case that the United Kingdom and the European Union should levy customs duties on each other was “a total deterrent”.
The Wayde Sims shooting: The police arrest of Dyteon Simpson in connection with the LSU player's death
Police have arrested one suspect for the death of Wayde Sims in a deadly shooting, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
The 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for another-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge police.
The authorities released a video of the fighting between Sims and Simpson and said that Sims had lost his glasses in his attacks.
According to WAFB, the CBS sister company, police found glass eyes on the scene and said they had genetics from Simpson on them.
The police say Simpson confessed to interrogations that he had shot Wayde and killed him.
According to his lawyer, there was a certain guarantee of a sum of $350,000.
The law attorney's office in East Baton Rouge County issued a preliminary report on Friday saying that the cause of death is a gunshot to the head and down to the neck.
The authorities wanted to thank the Special Forces in Louisiana, the police crime lab, the police at the University of Southern University and the local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, director of the LSU sport, thanked law enforcement officers for “his zeal and his search for justice. ”
Sims was 20 years old.
The tall two - foot - long [2 m] extension grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
He scored an average of 5.6 points and took 2.6 outs for each game during the last season.
Will Wade, LSU’s basketball coach, said on Friday morning that the team was “tortured” and“ in shock” because of Wayde’s death.
"This is something you're always worried about," said Wade.
Mountain spues ashes across Mexico City
Ash from Mount Popocatepetl has reached the southern capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention recommended that Mexicans stay away from the mountain on Saturday after increased activity and 183 cases of gas and ashes were recorded over a period of 24 hours.
The center was monitored by a vibe and a quake from the volcano.
Photographs from the community media showed a thin layer of ashes on car windows in the suburbs of Mexico, such as Xochimilco.
Physicists have noticed increased activity in the volcano, which is 72 kilometres southeast of the capital, from the earthquake of 7.1 on the Richter crossing the central part of Mexico in September 2017.
The Mount of Fire, known as “Don Goyo, ” has been active since 1994.
Police in conflict with the Catalan apartheid just before the birthday of a voluntary allowance
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independent Protestants took part in riot police, and thousands participated in protests on the occasion of the first birthday of the controversial elections in Catalonia to declare independence.
A group of masked sepulchres stoned riot police with eggs and threw dust paints that formed dark dust on the streets, which were usually filled with other tourists.
Later on, conflicts broke out, and police used bats to control attacks.
The separationists cried out: “We shall not forget and forgive” for an hour or so, while their opposers shouted against: ‘ Long live Spain. ’
Fourteen needed attention because of the minor harm they suffered in the protests, according to the local media.
The independence of the region continues a year after the National Act of October 1st was ruled illegal by the authorities of Madrid, but it was celebrated by the Catholic divorcing.
The majority of the electorate chose independence, but participation was poor, since most of those opposed to separation ignored the election.
According to the Catholic authorities, nearly a thousand people were injured last year when police tried to stop the election at election locations across the region, which led to conflicts.
People of independence had stayed overnight on Friday to prevent protests from supporting the nation’s police.
The protest went on, but it was forced to go another way.
Narcis Termes, a 68 - year - old electric generator, joined his wife’s protests with protests of separation, saying that he was no longer hopeful that Catalonia would gain independence.
“ Last year, we had some of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy at being able to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite having achieved a necessary but limited victory in the final December polls, Catalonia’s independent groups have struggled to keep pace this year, since many of the best - known leaders are either in voluntary exile or in detention waiting for trial due to their role in organising the vote and the declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42 - year - old mechanic who protested the police on his phone, said that politicians of both states had encouraged this conflict.
He said, "The tension is increasing all the time."
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison and asked the trial from the late last year, announced that he would volunteer to the European Parliament next year.
"My message in the European elections is the best way to condemn the return to democratic values and the oppression we have seen the Spanish government use," he said.

It is also possible that the vehicle may have been shot from a crossbow.
Contamination score 1-0 Livingston win against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal won Livingston
Team Livingston, who came from the lower division, arrived in an open shield, and Steven Gerrard had to face another loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox team.
Mark Dolly Menga made the fortune and team Gary Holt's now in second place with the Hibernian.
The Gerrard team has not yet worked in the field of the original section of this season and is playing against Hearts, which are eight points ahead of the top, the next Sunday.
For this game, Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna to the European Parliament on Thursday.
At the same time Livingston is still undefeated in the six-win division, and Holt's chief coach hasn't had to experience any loss since he replaced Kenny Miller in the last month.
Livingston loses opportunities for biteless guests
The Holts should have been over a long time before it cut a mark, but their directness caused Rangers much trouble.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but hesitated in his attempt to score, and Alan Lithgow then shot past after running through the defense to receive a bald consignment from Graig Halkett across the target.
The guests let Rangers play in front of them calmly, knowing that they could cause trouble to the guests in the right places.
And that was how the goal of importance was cut.
Rangers got an extra effort, and Livingston worked to create a goal opportunity. Declan Gallagher and Robinson helped Menga in a joint venture, who accepted the shipment and scored from the middle of the range.
At that point, Rangers had taken control of the ball, but the defense of the locals was unbreakable, and Liam Kelly, a goalkeeper, did not have to work hard.
So it continued into the second half of the game, even though Alfredo Morelos had managed to defend from Kelly.
Scott Pitman was stopped by Allan McGregor, Ranger's target, and Lithgow shot from the target after a visit from Livingston.
The ghosts were constantly in Livingston, but they were kicked out, and two demands for a white horse - after Halkett's defense against the defender Glenn Middleton, and one after the hand - were rejected.
"Beautiful" by Livingston Analysis
Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland reporter at Tony Macaroni's stadium
Excellent performance and finals for Livingston.
For an ordinary man, they stood out wonderfully and continued to exceed all expectations on their way up.
Their playing style and teammates have hardly changed anything since they returned to the top division, but Holt deserves much commendation for having squeezed the team together from his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Halkett, a leader was extremely good and led a fully organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on his toes all the time.
Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As good as they have been under Gerrard’s rule, they played far under expectations.
They failed to complete their visits and managed only once to open up the home half, so this should be a wake-up call for Rangers, who are now in the center of the division.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Cologne
It was smiling and bright sky on Saturday (September 29), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met over breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of the controversial visit of Erdogan to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship between the two nations.
Differences have arisen between them in terms of issues such as human rights, the media and the integration of Turkey into the European Union.
Erdogan then moved to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city is home to most Turkish residents outside Turkey itself.
The police used security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but the number of supporters could be in her vicinity to see her president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan — many of them Kurds — also heard and condemned both the policy of Erdogan and the decision of German governments to invite him to the country.
The two protesters reflect how controversial this guest is, but he is hailed as a hero of some Turks in Germany and hated as a devout of others.
Invasion of Deptford: Wheelman killed by car
A biker killed himself in a car in London.
The conflict near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, which are a common street in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, reached about 10.15 p.m.
The car driver stopped, and the paramedics provided attention, but the man died in an accident.
The collision occurred several months after another bicycle driver died in a collision where the driver drove off on Childreners Street, one mile [1.5 km] from Saturday’s accident site.
The police said that she was working to identify the man and let his closest associates know.
After closing the road and directing other routes, drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six will be wounded in riots
Six prisoners were wounded when riots broke into a men’s security prison, as reported by a prison agency.
Disasters broke out in the Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire at 9:30 p.m. to British local time on Sunday and still toss.
Special officers have been called to the territory to try to control the riots of eight prisoners, and they are only in one of the prisons.
The guards received attention because of minor injury to the face in the field.
One prison spokesman said: “Special prison officers have been called out to deal with events in Long Lartin Prison.
Six employees have received treatment for injury.
There is no violence in our prisons, and we make it clear that the responsibilities will be handed over to the police and may be expecting to spend even more time behind locks and bars."
More than 500 prisoners are in the Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was announced that the jailer had to go to the hospital after a prisoner attacked him.
And in October of last year, an unruly police officer was called on the spot to deal with a serious disturbance to peace, where people were attacked by billiards.
The Rosa hurricane threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with rapids (driving area may benefit from)
It is rare for a tropical region to cross Arizona, but it is likely that it will be early next week when the remains of the hurricane rosa cross the southwest, with a risk of rapid flooding.
The country's weather room has already issued warnings about rapid flooding by Monday and Tuesday in the west of Arizona and the south and west of Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is estimated that Rose will cross Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive late on Monday with a result.
The Phoenix Weather Station said on Twitter that only “ten hurricanes have been able to maintain the strength to class as tropical storms or lowers in less than 200 miles [320 km] away from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane less than 64 km away from the Arizona border."
The last predictions from the hurricane center of the country predict a 5-10 cm solution, with a single outlet up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
It is likely that the result will be 2.5 to 5 cm in other regions of the southwest, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, with the possibility of unique results up to 10 cm.
For those who are not at risk of rapid flooding, the results of Rosa could be a blessing, as there are severe droughts in the area.
Although floods can cause great damage, some of these results will have a positive effect, as drought is now in the southwest.
According to the U.S. drought control, there is at least a very high drought of more than 40 percent of Arizona, which is the second-highest group," according to the weather.com report.
First, on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico, the hurricane of Rosa will reach its destination.
Rosa was still classified as a hurricane on Sunday morning with a maximum wind intensity of 136 km per hour, 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and travels north at a speed of 19 km per hour.
The storm passes over the cooler sea in the Pacific, so its power decreases.
Thus, he is expected to land in Mexico as a tropical storm on the afternoon of Monday or Monday night.
There is a high potential for some areas of Mexico, with a significant risk of flooding.
"It is expected that the result will be 7.5 to 15 cm in Baja California and into the northwest of Sonora, with a potential of up to 25 cm output," said a report from weather.com.
Then Rosa will cross Mexico, as a tropical storm, and then reach the Arizona border early on the morning of the third day as a tropical region. She will then continue through Arizona and arrive at the southern Utah late on Tuesday night.
“The most likely risk from Rosa or her remains is very high in Baja California, northwest of Sonora and southwest of the desert region of the United States, ” said the country’s hurricane center.
This outcome is expected to cause life - threatening rapids and movements of soil in the deserts, and steps toward the end of the mountain.
The Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Killing Arrests
Three juveniles and a 20 - year - old man have been arrested for suspicion of attempted murder, after a 16 - year - old boy was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The youth was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton, about 4:00 p.m., at a British local time on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where his condition is said to be “stable. ”
One 17 - year - old, two 18 - year - old, and one 20 - year - old were arrested at night in the Radstock area, according to the Avon and Somerset police.
The police have asked for a witness who might have a telephone recording of what happened.
Trump says that Kavanaugh was “feeling evil and anger” by the Democratic Party
"The vote in support of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote which rejects the unmerciful and outrageous methods of the Democratic Party," said Trump at a meeting with supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaughh “got to feel the evil and the anger ” of the Democratic Party out of all his processes.
Kavanaugh witnessed to the Congress on Thursday, where he harshly denied the accusations made by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually harassed her several decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also witnessed to the committee about his accusations.
The president said on Saturday that “Americans had seen genius and quantity and courage ” of Kavanaughh the other day.
'Confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote confirming one of the most clever lawyers of our time, a lawyer with an excellent record as a public official,' he said to the group of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh’s nomination when he spoke of the importance of the participation of Republican supporters in the mid - term review.
“ There are five weeks in one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don't offer myself, but I really do," he said.
“That’s why I’m going across a wide range of fields to fight for great candidates.”
Trump argued that democrats were working “to silence and hinder. ”
The first keynote payment on the floor of the Department of Elders regarding the appointment of Kavanaugh should be made no later than Friday, according to the representative of the leaders of Republican Republics in an interview with CNN.
Hundreds died of earthquakes and floods in Indonesia, and likely the number of those who died would rise.
At least 384 died, and many were washed away for a vast wave on the shores, when great earthquakes and floods came over the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a festival on the beach in the city of Pala on Friday, when up to six feet [6 m] high waves were on the beach at sunset, many people washed out on the sea, and destroyed everything that happened to them.
The wave was formed after an earthquake of 7.5 degrees Fahrenheit [7.5 ° C].
“ When the wave was formed yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they died,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, an Indonesian disaster spokesman, at an information meeting in Jakarta.
“The wave did not come alone, she pulled cars, trees, houses, she hit everything on the land,” Nugroho said and added that the wave had traveled over the open sea at 800 miles [800 km] before she hit the beach.
Some climbed a tree to escape the tide and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were transferred to 24 centers in Palau.
The disaster agency’s aerial photographs showed many ruined buildings and shops, twisted bridges and deserted mosques surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to ride across the beach on Saturday.
The order of the earthquakes was observed in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
Indonesia’s establishment on food and technology, said that the energy that was released from the sledgehammer in the big quake on Friday would have been some 200 times greater than that of the atomic bomb that fell on the city of Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, at the end of a long and narrow flood, may have increased the size of the flood wave, said the Agency.
Nugroho said that the damage was “real ” and that thousands of homes, hospitals, malls, and hotels had collapsed.
The body of a few victims was found trapped under wrecks from broken buildings, he said, and he added that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the loss and damage to property could be greater along the shoreline 300 km [300 km] north of Pala, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the surface of the earthquake.
Communication, said Nugroho, “is completely down and no information is coming from Donggala. ”
“Over 300,000 people live there,” said the Red Cross in a declaration, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the area.
"It has already become a tragedy, but it may be much worse," said the Red Cross.
The foundation was criticized by many on Saturday for not telling us that a floodgate had swung on Palau, even though public representatives said that the waves had arrived within the time of the warning.
In a video published on social media, you could hear a cry from the upper floor of a building to warn the people on the street below that a flood strike was approaching.
Just minutes later, the wave of floods strikes on the beach and carries off buildings and cars.
Reuters could not confirm the video immediately.
The earthquake and the tide caused an electricity shortage that prevented communication with Palu and made it difficult for authorities to organize relief work.
The army has begun to send relief aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but people who have been helped by the area still need a great deal of food and other necessities.
The city’s airport has only been reopened for relief operations and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is going to visit the fleeing hubs of Pala on Sunday.
The number of dead goes over 800 after a tidal wave in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
Staff of World Vision from Donggala have reached the city of Pala, where they seek refuge in the cities of the tent that were set up in the garden outside their offices. They were exposed to destruction on the way, according to Mr. Doseba.
“ People said they saw many houses destroyed, ” he said.
The situation is very bad.
Help - service groups have started a hard job, but some have complained that traveling to Palu would prevent extraneous relief workers with a high level of expertise.
In accordance with Indian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and staff can only start if the accident zone is declared a disaster zone.
It hasn't been done yet.
"This is still a local accident zone," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman of the Indian Red Cross.
Once the government has declared this to be a disaster area, we can open up to foreign aid, but no declaration has yet been made."
When the second night fell upon Palu after the earthquake and the flood wave on Friday, friends and their families, who are still missing, hoped that their loved ones would be one of the miraculous tales that sparked the destructive prefaces of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from the gutter.
On Sunday, relief workers rescued a woman who had been stuck under ruins for two days with her mother’s body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indian Air Force, had been the coach of two now missing gliders for the Asian games that ended earlier in that month in Indonesia.
Others locked up in the Roa Roa hotel were his students, including Mr. Monday.
“As a man with long experience in flying, I have my own emotional burden to bear, ” he said.
Mr. Gendon reported that the hour after the news broke out inside the floater group because the Roa Roa hotel collapsed, he had sent WhatsApp messages in desperation to the competitors who stayed in Pala and participated in the beach festival.
His message, however, showed only a grey sign, instead of a blue one.
“ I think it meant that the messages were not received, ” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 to replenish the Newport on the Life
On Friday morning, thieves robbed $26,750 from Brink's staff, who were filling up an ATM in Newport on the Levee, as reported by the Newport police.
The driver of the car had been emptying an ATM in the entertainment area and was spending more money on it, said Officer Dennis McCarthy in the announcement.
When he was doing his job, another man came “running behind the Brink worker ” and stole a bag of money intended for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspected refugees from the scene, as reported, but police did not reveal how many were involved.
Those who may have information about the suspects are asked to contact the Newport police on phone 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes its name in Ye
The rapper Kanye West is going to change his name--in Ye.
He announced the change to Twitter on Saturday and wrote: “The creature formerly known as Kanye West. ”
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time and used the name of the title of his eighth record that came out in June.
The change occurs for his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to announce his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces Ariana Grandi in the show, but for “emotional reasons, ” the manufacturer said.
West has previously said that this name has a religious significance for him, but it is also a shortcut to his present name.
“ I think that ‘ye’ (you) is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you, ’ ” West said earlier in the year when he discussed the name on his record with the radio director Big Boy.
“So that I am you, I am us, this is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, and into only Ye--to be just a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The record is rather a reflection of who we are."
He is one of many famous robbers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Didy or Didy, but this year he announced that he would rather be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, former West co-worker, has also written his name both with and without band and capital.
The elected president of Mexico promises not to use the military against the general population
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use military force against civilians, now that the country will soon remember 50 years of bloodguilty vengeance students.
On Saturday in the Tlatelolco Square, Lopez Obrador promised: “Never use the army to oppress the Mexican people. ”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers shot at peaceful protests in the square, dropping up to 300 people at a time when the left - winged movements of students were taking root in all of Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young people in Mexico by providing monthly support to all students and opening up more free public schools.
He has said that unemployment and lack of learning opportunities attract young people to criminal activities.
The United States should double funds for artificial intelligence
Now that China is increasingly active in artificially-diagnosed, the United States should double the funding it spends on research in that field, says the inventor and pro-device user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were made after the various divisions of the United States government announced artificial intelligence, even though the United States did not have a formal overall plan on artificial intelligence.
China, on the other hand, announced its plan last year: it aims to be first in the creation by 2030.
“It would be a good start to double the amount of money spent on satellite research, considering that all other countries are so much farther behind the United States, and we are waiting to see the next major discovery in the field of artificial intelligence,” said Lee.
Twofold funding could double the likelihood that the next major discovery will be made in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, the author of the book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order ” published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the director of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of the most important fake companies in China.
He worked on an artificial intelligence system in the '90s at Carnegie Mellon University, which worked as the best player in the United States in Othello, and later he was the manager of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese Department at Google.
Lee spoke of previous technical competitions conducted by the U.S. authorities, such as the military robotic competition, and asked when the next race would be held, to see the next pioneers.
According to Lee, scientists in the United States often have to work hard to get strength from the government.
“It’s not China that appeals to its main ideas, it’s the companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired engineers from universities to work with artificial intelligence in the past few years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen their satellite research.
“I feel that those who have a doctorate in artificial science should be granted a residence permit automatically, ” he said.
Congress of China published its future performance plan in July 2017.
According to Lee, the China Institute of Natural Science provides funds for people who work at university institutes, similar to the National Science Foundation and similar public institutions in the United States, but the quality of scientific work is worse in China.
Earlier this year, the United States Ministry of Defence launched a satellite intelligence center to cooperate with both industry and educational institutions, and the White House announced the creation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that it had invested $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
With regard to NSF, it invests over 100 million dollars a year in artificial research.
At the same time, United States legislation designed to establish a nuclear safety committee has not been in place for months.
The Macedonians opt for a national allowance for whether to change the country’s name
The people of Macedonia opted for a referendum on Sunday on whether the country's name should be changed to Northern Macedonia in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has closed its application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a region called Macedonia and argues that its neighbours’ names in the north are equivalent to their requirements for their territory and therefore deny them entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new name, but national opposers argue that the change will undermine the self - image of the majority of Macedonia’s inhabitants of Slavonic origin.
Gjorge Ivanov, President of the United States, has said that he will not participate in the vote and campaign to ignore it has raised doubts about reaching the 50 - percent minimum threshold, so that the vote is considered valid.
The question on the election note is this: “Do you want to go to NATO and the EU by agreeing to the agreement with Greece? ”
The promoters of the change of name, including the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that this is a reasonable price for Macedonia to join the alliances like the EU and NATO, but the country is one of those formed after the fall of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to choose the future of the country for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although the conclusion is not legally binding, enough Congressmen have said that they will go after it and bind it into law.
The change of name would require the approval of two thirds of the Congress.
The Committee of Wise Men said that no unusual news had been reported at 1 a.m.
However, participation was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent, in the last council elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters paid their votes.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe, ” said Gjose Tanevski, 62 - year - old voter in the capital city of Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son, Dushko, paid their votes in the National Remuneration Grant in Macedonia on whether to change the country’s name, but this would benefit its entry into NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Before the Skopje Senate, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, worked to prepare a small field and set up chairs in front of tents built by those who will ignore the vote.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to become members with our heads high, not going through the service door," said Kavardarkov.
“ We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to agree to us as Macedonia, we can turn another way like China or Russia and become part of Europe."
The Prime Minister of Zaev says that NATO will provide the necessary funding to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
“I believe that the longest majority will agree that more than 80 percent of the country’s population are in favour of the EU and NATO, ” said Zaev after paying his vote.
He said that agreement would be “a confirmation of our future. ”
A survey published on Monday from the Macedonian Political Research Institute showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the national referendum, which is less than the minimum required.
Another TV TV survey showed that 57 percent of the respondents were going to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would say yes.
In order for national payments to be counted as valid, a 50 - percent plus one vote must be met.
If the vote has not been approved, it could mean the first serious shock to the government's policy, which is being followed by the Western countries, since it was adopted in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero, player Manchester City, goes through all the defense Brighton and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling went lightly with the protection Brighton won the Manchester City 2-0 Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored his goal in 65 minutes.
The Argentinean advance received a shipment at the center of the field at the beginning of the visit.
He sprang past three of Brighton’s defenses and then went out to the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four fenced defenders.
He got past one of his defensemen and then ran away from a few more right at Brighton's stand.
Then he sent to the left and found Sterling there.
The English forwarder used the first touch of the tent to send the ball back to Aguero, who used the right foot to play on Mathew Ryan, the target Brighton, with a shot at the right side of the target.
"Aguero has some issues in his mind," said Pep Guardiola, Chief Executive of City, to reporters.
“ We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
Then this happened.
We were lucky that he scored a mark at this moment."
But it was Sterling who gave them the blue first goal in the original league game.
That point came in 29 minutes.
Aguero received a shipment far in the field half of Brighton on that visit.
He sent a magnificent long ball to the left of Leroy Sane.
Sane kicked the ball several times and then sent Sterling toward the far pole.
The advancer sent the ball to the net just before it ran out.
City is playing against Hoffenheim in the Championships at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Necker Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a rockies game
Since the Nationals have been excluded from playing in the finals, there was little reason to force another start.
But the energetic Scherzer hopes to get tossed on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies still have the chance to get into the finals, but they have the same premise over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West.
Rockies got at least a wildcard seat with their 5-2 victory at Nationals on Friday night, but the team is still trying to reach its first title.
“ Even though we play free, we can at least play for an electric atmosphere in Denver as well as the other team after playing their best game this year.
Why shouldn't I want to compete in such a situation?"
The Nationals will still report on who will be the first thrower in the Sunday game, but it is thought that they will throw Scherzer at those times.
Scherzer, who was about to start a 34th time, took an exercise session on Thursday and would roll on a Sunday, which is his normal Sabbath.
This right - handed thrower at Washington is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and a 300 blower for 220 2/3 cycles at this season.
Trump Visits the West Virginia
The president referred directly to the case of Kavanaugh, a nominated Supreme Court judge, when he spoke of the importance of the involvement of the Republican supporters in the mid - term review.
“ Everything is at stake in November.
There are five weeks in one of the most important elections of our lives.
It's one of the big, big... I don't offer myself, but I do, but that's why I'm going around a lot to fight for the great proponents," he said.
Trump continued, saying: “You see this terrible, radical group of democrats, you can see it happening now.
And they are determined to regain power by whatever means necessary, you see the cruelty, the wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go to get power and government, they just want power and government, we don't give it to them.
He said that democrats were working “to keep quiet and to prevent. ”
"And it has been seen in the past four days," he said, saying to democrats "be wrath and evil and cruel and untrue."
He named Senator Diane Feinstein, a member of the Governing Body of a Democratic Committee of the Senate, in his name, and was answered with a loud voice from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Was it you who cut the document?
Ha, what.
No, no, I waited in one... it was really bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The working class is no longer tolerant of the church.
He Cannot Accept Those Expressing His Mind
When my group's operative Momentum chose to make a statement to me, it hardly came as a surprise.
After all, I am the last of many members of the workers ’ group who have been told that we are not welcome, just for expressing our mind.
Joan Ryan, my associate, received similar treatment, for she strongly opposed prejudices against Jews.
In my case, it was my case that I had been tried because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The issue was the importance of having a responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe, of ironically similar issues, to which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The report on the Nottingham East meeting on Friday said: “We want the meetings to be non-existent and effective. ”
In my eight - year career as a member of the Workers ’ Party, Friday meetings have been the most frequent.
Unfortunately, it is not the tone of many meetings today, and the promise of “milder and better ” politics has been forgotten if it ever began.
It has become more and more evident that different opinions have not been passed by the Workers ’ Group and that all opinions are judged as to whether the leaders of the Group consider them acceptable.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when fellow workers, whom I thought I had previously had similar political views, began to expect me to take a complete turn and support opinions that I had never previously agreed on, whether they were national security or a common EU market area.
So every time I speak publicly - and it doesn't matter what I say - there's a bit of disgrace on the community media where I'm called after my expulsion, middle government issues are denied, and I'm telling myself I shouldn't be in the Workers' Group.
And this isn't just my experience.
I know that I am happier than some of my colleagues, since most of the speeches I receive are usually political.
I admire the professionalism and affirmation of those who have to endure the cataclysms of sexual or prejudiced insults every day but never retreat.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political period is how violent attacks and insults have become a normal part of everyday life.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Workers ’ Party should pay attention to a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer tolerant of a church, and with every lack of confidence or change in choices, the class becomes more and more narrow.
I have received many counsel in the last two years to be modest, not too loud, and I would be “all right. ”
But I did not decide to take part in politics to do so.
Since I became a member of the Workers ’ Group who studied 32 years ago, motivated by the neglect of the government of Thatcher, who left my schoolroom in defeat, I have fought for better public service for those who need it most, whether I was in the local government or at a council.
I have never hidden my political views, nor my last election.
No one in Nottingham East can be in any doubt about my policy and where I disagree with current leaders.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would just like to say that when the country is heading for Brexit, which will harm the home, the company and our public service, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy in my loyalty to the leaders of the Workers' Party.
But my one message, which I will send from me, is not to Nottingham Moments, but to those who are within my heart, whether they are members of the Working Party or not: I serve you proudly, and I promise that no threats of aberration or political expulsion will deter me from doing what I consider to be for the best of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered team Ayr goes to the top
Two late touchdowns might have shocked the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr had the victory in this momentous game of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the list and one out of ten that is still undefeated.
In the end, it was their stronger protection and better use of opportunities that made homemakers more successful, and Peter Murchie coach was fully entitled to be happy.
“We’ve had strong opposition in our games up here and are still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Observe praise, they have taken advantage of their opportunities better than we have. ”
Mark Grant Anderson came over Ayr to 14 minutes after Frazier Climo turned the call on, but a yellow card on the Scottish president, who was allowed to play the game with Warriors, enabled Melrose to make the numbers speak and Jason Baggot scored touchdown.
Climo increased the lead of Ayr with hell before he scored with a kick just before half a game and then touched the touchdown and came over 17-5 half a game.
However, Melrose began his second half game with Patrick Anderson’s touchdown, after Baggot turned on the call, reduced the target difference to five points.
Then took a long time to cover serious injuries at Ruaridh Knott, which had to be carried out on a playground, and after that Ayr still increased his leadership with a touchdown from Stafford McDowall, after Climo turned on the visit.
Blair Macpherson, leader of Ayr, then got the yellow card and Melrose took advantage of being a man over with a touchdown from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a tough visit.
On the other hand, locals came back strong and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for having enabled Climo without the ball, MacPherson scored a touchdown behind the Ayr mission, after an extra effort.
Climo turned the visit to, as he did again immediately after the reboot, after Kyle Rowe reached David Amrstrong's kick from the rig and sent to Gregor Henry who cut the fifth touch mark of the team.

'The sea is ours': the shoreless country of Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors are guarding the fleet's headquarters in La Paz.
General buildings flag blue flags.
Fleet stations from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are marked by the slogan: “We have rights to the sea.
It's our duty to recover it."
Around all the shores, Bolivia’s reminder of the shoreline, lost to Chile in bloody battles in the 19th century, was still fresh in memory, along with its desire to reinvigorate the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the strongest in decades, now that Bolivia is awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice in The Hague on October 1, after five years of trial.
“ Bolivia has the power, the spirit of unity, and the restlessness, and is, of course, waiting for the decision with a positive mind, ” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomati.
Many inhabitants of Bolivia will observe the International Court’s ruling on large nationwide screens, hoping that the Court of Justice in The Hague will decide in favour of Bolivia’s requirement to grant Bolivia access after decades of difficult talks.
The Monday decision is also very important for Evo Morales, the president of the country's Indian family, who will have a controversial campaign for reviews next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised late in August.
However, some analysts consider it unlikely that the court favored Bolivia, and that if he did, it would change little.
The court, which has headquarters in the Netherlands, has no power to give land to Sile and has decided that the decision will not affect the outcome of the discussion.
The fact that the court’s ruling only comes six months after listening to the final discourse indicates that the case “had not been complicated, ” said Paz Sárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
It is also possible that over the past four years, Bolivia has not been in question for the past four years, but it has caused the country to return.
“The current Bolivian government has stolen the issue of access to the ocean,” said Zárate.
A mighty saying of Morales has diminished all the goodwill of Sile, she counted.
Bolivia and Sile will continue discussions someday, but it will be very difficult after this.
The two countries have not been traded on ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, former president of Bolivia and representative of the Hague State, rejected the idea that the court’s decision had taken unusually short time.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “a unique opportunity to open up a new relationship with Sile ” and the opportunity to“ bring an end to a conflict that lasts for 139 years in due course, both countries for good, ” he said.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales, another of the most popular presidents in Latin America, would use this matter as a political estuary.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific, ” he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to see that we need to recover from the past. ”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can be trusted by the United States
Ri Yong Ho, Secretary of State of North Korea, says that the country will never take down its nuclear weapons first if it can't trust Washington.
Ri gave his speech on Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He called on the United States to follow the promises they made in Singapore between the leaders of the nations.
His statement now comes as Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, seems to be reintroducing talks on nuclear weapons, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with Kim Jong Un, leader of North Korea.
Ri says that it is 'dreamers' to continue to demand business and protest the United States against the declaration of the end of the Korean war will ever kneel down to North Korea.
Washington doesn't want to agree to the statement unless Pyongyang takes concrete action first to take down his nuclear weapons.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, President of the United States, want to meet again at another meeting.
On the other hand, there are deep doubts that Pyongyang is serious about taking down weapons that the country is likely to consider as the only way to secure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the next meeting between Kim and Trump.
The fashion shows in Paris will present the latest series of big scalps that will come to fashion stores near you
If you want to enlarge your hat library or be completely hidden from the sun, you do not have to search any further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed many strange hats in their oversizes for their SS19 lines on the fashion field that engulfed the toleration during the fashion week in Paris.
The number of images of very inappropriate hats has been published on Instagram in the summer, and these designers have had their recent creations on display in fashion shows.
Valentino’s main work was a large light - brown hat with a wide body that resembled feathers and covered the head of the bodice.
Of other large - sized components, watermelons could be seen placing gems, sailor hats, and even pineapples, but these items are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced many strange masks, just at the right time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were decorated with lips, and they looked more like Hannibal Lecter than they were in the high fashion.
One mask resembled a snorkelling device with a breathable pipe and a glass of glass, while another resembled a burning ice in a bread form.
If you want to play ball, you're lucky.
The fashion experts predict that the big hats could soon be sold in the fashion stores near you.
Large hats come with a dose of heel 'La Bomba', a straw hat with over 60cm - size weights that have adorned the head from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The fashion label behind the very inappropriate hat, seen on all the community media, was inspired by another major part of the fashion scene — a neckline beach bag that was almost the same size as the swimweared model that carried it.
The orange strata, with a strawberry and a white leather handle, was the main part of the La Riviera SS10 Jacquemus clothing line in the fashion week in Paris.
Luke Armitage, the famous stylist, told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags appear in the fashion stores for the next summer — since the designer has caused such a great deal of impact, it should be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized parts. ”
John Edward: The capacity of the world’s population to reach its goal
The private schools in Scotland are known for the outstanding success of their students and have continued in 2018 with new, stunning test results, which are still strengthened by individual and group achievements in sports, art, music and other social activities.
These schools have up to 30,000 students all over Scotland, with The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) defending them, and they strive to provide their students and their parents with the best possible service.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further further further education, the career they have chosen, and their position as a citizen of the world.
As a teaching sector that can assemble and train for specialized study programmes, we see that new things continue to be popular subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a person in a language he understands, it touches his mind.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, it will touch his heart."
This is an important reminder that we cannot rely solely on English to build relationships and trust with people from other lands.
This year’s test results show that languages are at the top of the lists of the highest proportion of students who pass private school tests.
68 percent of foreign - language students received the A grade of excellence.
The data collected from 74 schools within the SCIS showed that 72 percent of students received the A - mandarin grade, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French, and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish also received the A grade.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as the necessary skills that children and young people will surely need in the future.
At the moment, languages, such as choices, are placed in the same place as science - related subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in private school and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills revealed that, for reasons that employers indicated difficulties in recruiting, 17 percent was because of lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more important in preparing young people for their future tasks.
Now that more and more jobs are required in languages, this skill is needed in a global world.
No matter what career people choose, learning another language will have a real advantage in the future, a skill that will last forever.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will give more weight to the individual the automatic advantage of the competitors.
According to a 2013 survey conducted by YouGov in over 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75 percent of them could not speak another language well enough for conversation, and French was the only language spoken by two letters a percentage, or 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important for children today to invest immediately in language teaching.
Multiplicity, especially in emerging countries, will give children a better opportunity to find important jobs.
In Scotland, the language they teach varies from school to school.
A number of schools will focus on new classical languages, while others will teach languages that are thought to be the most important for Britain when looking to 2020, such as mandarin or Japanese.
No matter where your child’s interest lies, he will always be able to choose languages from private schools with specialised teachers.
Scottish private schools commit themselves to volunteering for a study environment that will prepare children and prepare them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
There is no denying that at this time, in the global business environment, languages remain necessary for the future of the country, and they must be reflected in education.
In fact, today’s language should be viewed as “an international skill in relations. ”
Private schools will continue to offer choice, diversity, and superiority to young Scotland.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
John Edwards, Chairman of the Scottish Private School Council
LeBron plays his first game for Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The waiting is about to end for fans who want to see LeBron James play their first game for the Los Angeles Lakers team.
Luke Walton, Coach Lakers, has announced that James will be playing on Sunday at the opening of the season against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he's gonna play has not yet been determined.
“It will be longer than a minute and shorter than 48,” said Walton on Laker’s official website.
Mike Trudell, a reporter for Lakers, said on Twitter that James would probably play for a limited time.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked about his schedule for six Lakers games before the start of the season.
“ During this period of my career, I don’t have to play games for the season to prepare, ” he said.
Timings for Trump's election meeting in Western Virginia and YouTube
President Donald Trump will hold a number of election meetings and the first one is tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
He is one of five organized meetings next week, where he will also stop at friends locations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote to confirm his choice of a new Supreme Court judge has been suspended, Trumpet aims to build up support for the next mid-term review, because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when a vote is taken in November.
What time is the election meeting of Trump in Western Virginia, and how can you watch him online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to begin at 7:00 a.m. on the east coast tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump meeting in Western Virginia on the web below through a live YouTube broadcast.
It is likely that Trump will refer the case to Brett Kavanaugh, a designated Supreme Court judge, who was under arrest for the charges of sexual assault, to confirm that he was a judge for up to a week while the FBI investigates the charges.
But the main goal of Trump’s meeting is to help the Republicans get their way better, but they are waiting for a tough election in November.
Therefore, the announcement from Trump’s campaign that these five meetings, which will be held next week, aim to “fill volunteers and supporters with zeal as the Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and in the Congress, ” according to Reuter’s news agency.
"The President's plan is so vital to the administration that he will travel to as many states as possible at the start of a busy campaign," said an unidentified spokesman from Trump's campaign at Reuters' news agency.
The meeting will be held at the Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling and it is expected that supporters will come from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and that the media from Pittsburgh will tell him,” according to the West Virginia Metro News News Office.
The Saturday find will be another Trump visit to Western Virginia this month, but he won by over 40 percent will in this state in 2016.
Trump wants to try to help Patrick Morrissey, the proponent Republican Republic of Western Virginia to the Senate, but he's downstairs in the polls.
"It is not good for Morrissey to know that the President needs to come and try to increase his popularity," said Simon Haeder, political scientist at the University of Western Virginia, according to Reuters' news agency.
Ryder the Cup 2018: The United States is fighting to keep the hope alive for the individual competition on Sunday
After three rounds of one - sided rounds, the fourth, which was late on Saturday, could be just what was needed in this race for the Ryder Cup.
A successful race is a concept of sport that has been invented and that is truly believed by players, and never more than in the competition like this.
Where would they say that success is now under way?
“They had a six-point lead, and now it’s four points, so that success is more on our side now, I guess, ” said Jordan Spieth when he set off in the race of the day.
Of course, Europe has the forefront, four points ahead of it, with 12 additional points at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth said, think they have some wind in their sails and they can hope for many, especially the Spieth and Justin Thomas forms that played together all day and each got three out of four.
Spieth has played a great deal to the point of flattening his example.
As the round went, the cheers increased, and he put down an important score to take all four points in the game after he and Thomas had been two points below two.
His pope, who gave them victory in the 15th hole, had a similar shout of joy, a shout of the kind that tells you that he believes that the American team still has a victory.
"You just have to dive deep and think about your own game," said Spieth.
That's the only thing these players can do right now.
18 holes to enter a point.
One player with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days is Francesco Molinaro and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of Ryder the Cup.
This strange but thrilling European couple have won four games and cannot do anything wrong.
“Moliwood ” was the only couple that got into the afternoon on Saturday, but they also managed to avoid going out on Saturday morning, on Friday afternoon, and on the nine holes of Friday morning.
That play and how their energy seems to flow to and from the loud audiences clearly shows that they are the couple who need to win on Sunday, and there would be no popular player to seal the potential victory of the European team than Fleetwood or Molinari, is the sun sitting over the Le Golf National site.
The best option would be for both of them to do so simultaneously in different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson went lightly with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the quarter in the morning, where he played with Alex Noren.
Shocks and two doubles in the first nine holes buried the Spanish and the Sweep in a hole that they never managed to scratch.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The quadruples and the quadruples are so exciting to watch closely because of the communication between the couples, their advice, the advice they don’t give, and how the schedule can change in one stage.
Europe has played better as a team here and has a considerable advance before the end of the day, but this four - quarter season also showed that the American team has the will to fight that some had doubted it had, especially the other Americans.
Europe with a 10-6 lead for the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good start for the final day of Ryder the Cup after four bullets and four of Saturdays, with a premise of 10-6 against the United States.
The asteroid Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over Tiger Woods, who were in difficulty, and have received four points at the Le Golf National Field.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who would like to regain the prize cup, which it lost on the Hazeltine field two years ago, showed great superiority over the Americas' team in the four-ball game of the morning and won 3-1.
The U.S. showed greater resistance to the quadruples and won two games but did not win the score.
Jim Fury’s team needed eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to continue the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who had the nickname "Molliwood" after a wonderful weekend, are only the second pair to win four points from their first four games in the history of Ryder.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four - ball game, they showed great teammates and won the defeat of Woods and the U.S. rookie Bryson Dechambeau 5-4.
Woods, who pulled himself through two games on Saturday, showed his geniuses, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four ball games and four games, and seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, who was staggered for the four-ball game of the morning, came back to his partner, Henrik Stenson in the quadruples and won the 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka--who are in the first and third place on the list of the best golfers of the world.
However, Europe did not go all the way on this mild and luxuriant day southwest of Paris.
Three times the winner in the golf, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the goal for the U.S. men with two points on Saturday.
They worked with difficulty 2-1 against Jon Rahm from Spain and Ian Poulter in four-ball games and later came back and defeated Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4-3 in the quadruples after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in the history of Ryder the cup that the team won four points, at the beginning of an individual race, although the team of Furys would only need equal force to continue the cup.
However, after two days of second - best service, a counterattack on Sunday seems to overpower them.
North Korea says one-sided disarmament “impossible” without trust
The Foreign Minister of North Korea told the U.S. on Saturday that a continued ban on trade only affected their distrust in the United States, and it would be impossible for the country to dismantle its nuclear weapons one side under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual General Assembly of the United States that North Korea had resorted to “substantial measures to show goodwill” in the past year, for example by stopping nuclear and rocket tests, taking down the nuclear test site, and promising to risk the development of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
He said, “We have not seen any corresponding reactions from the United States. ”
'Without confidence in the United States, there is no certainty about the security of our country, and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to take one side down our nuclear weapons first.'
Although Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to the 'situated' approach to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea was rewarded for every step it took, his declaration seemed special to the extent that he did not deny unilateral nuclear disarmament outright as Pyongyang had previously done.
Ri referred to the joint declaration by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the President of the United States and the North Korean leader, in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work on the 'nuclear disarmament of Korea' and Trump issued a promise to ensure the security of North Korea.
North Korea has sought solutions to bring a formal end to the Korean war in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang will have to leave its nuclear weapons after the first time.
Washington has also resisted calls to relax the severe ban on business against North Korea.
"The United States demands that "nuclear disarmament takes place first" and increases pressure by using a business request to reach its goal, even protesting the declaration to end the war," said Ri.
“ It is only the dreams of people who know nothing about us to think that a business request can get us on our knees.
But the problem is that our ongoing business request increases our distrust."
There was no mention of plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump, who was mentioned by the United States leader at the U.S. earlier this week.
Instead, the secretary spoke of three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-In, the leader of South Korea in the last five months, adding: “If the party to this nuclear disarmament issue were South Korea instead of the United States, it would not be this plight in the issue of nuclear disarmament in the Korean Peninsula.”
In spite of this, Ri’s speech was very different from his speech last year when he said at the General Assembly of the United States that it was inevitable to direct rockets from North Korea to the mainland of the United States after "the Devil President" Trump called Kim a "light rocketman" on a suicide mission.
Last year, Trump threatened to “bring” North Korea, but this year he praised Kim at the UN for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, but said that there was still much work to be done and that a business request had to be continued until North Korea had destroyed all its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time frame in this regard, saying: “If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter. ”
China and Russia say that the Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, on Thursday, U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo of the Security Council of the United States said: “The Security Council's trade ban must continue until complete nuclear disarmament has taken place and it is confirmed. ”
The Security Council agreed to increase the commercial ban on North Korea from 2006 in an effort to close the funding for the Pyongyang nuclear and missile plans.
Pompeo met Ri on the sideline of the U.S. General Assembly and reported that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times a year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that success had been achieved, but only a few hours later, North Korea condemned him for “criminal demands.”
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to take down a rocket area and a nuclear station if the United States resorted to "a corresponding action."
He said that Kim had said that the “corresponding actions ” he was looking for were security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore and actions toward normal relations with Washington.
The Harvard students take a class to rest well
A new course at Harvard University has given all students more sleep in an effort to resist the growing tendency of students to wake up and learn all night with the help of caffeine tablets.
A study showed that students at the world’s best university often know little or nothing about the basics of self - care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of dormitory medicine at Harvard Medical School and expert at Brigham and the women’s hospital, designed the course and thinks that it sees the first of its kind in the United States.
After giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on a study, he got the idea of doing the course.
“ At the end of the lecture, a girl came to my door and asked: “Why is this first said to me now, in my final year?
She said that no one had told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he said to Telegraph.
The first - held course this year explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help sports and even promote general well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of mental - health medicine at Harvard Medical School, and director of the medical school, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after learning that students were very sleepless over the week.
The study is an hour of length and involves various useful tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of a room at home, where students click on a cup of coffee, window tents, sports shoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance can deteriorate in lack of sleep, as well as the importance of a good routine for sleep.
In other parts, participants are told how the long - term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the school area with interactive symbols then encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know that this will not change students’ behaviour as a student.
But we feel that they have the right to know this, just as you have the right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture that favors those who stay awake and learn all night still exists, he said and added that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Assuring sufficient sleep for good, students should be “secret ” to fight stress, tiredness, and anxiety, he said — even to avoid fattening, since lack of sleep increases the brain’s call for food so that the body is a sage.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old professor of chemical and physical biology from California, helped Professor Czeisler put together the course, but he sat one of the professor's choirs last year in his first year in Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and encouraged him to call for a course for all students at school.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all masters to finish a similar course before they begin their university studies.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider adjusting the alarm clock, which reminds them to go to sleep, and to wake them up, and bear in mind the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic displays and LED light, which may confuse the internal clock of the body and lead to problems in falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mark from Menga shoots down Gerrard's men
Rangers still had trouble in the field, and Stevens Gerrard's disunited team had to accept a 1-0 loss on Livingston, by mark from Dolly Menga.
Team Ibrox wanted to win his first win at the prom after his victory at St Johnstone in February, but team Gary Holt gave team Gerrards only his second loss in his 18 games as executive. The team is now eight points behind Hearts, which is at the top seat of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
The amount of pollution cut seven minutes a half a game, and the Rangers seemed to lack all inspiration and was never likely to recover.
Rangers now fall down to sixth place, but Livingston goes up to the third and is only behind the Hibernian in the finish line.
Rangers may have further problems after the lineman, Calum Spence, had to receive attention because of head injury after some item was thrown into him from the course half of the guests.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that swept Ayr away and came to the conclusion of the Betfred Cup.
However, Holt kept to the same 11 - stage setup that reached the Hearts stage last week, and he would have been pleased with how well trained his companions were thinking about the resistance.
Rangers may have been more involved with the ball, but Livingston created more opportunities with the balls it reached.
They should have scored only two minutes after the game began when the first shipment from Menga came Scott Pitman in front of Allan McGregor's goal, but he shot past.
A long extra from Keaghan Jacobs ended up with Craig Halkett, but Alan Lithgow, his defense partner, passed the ferry pole.
Rangers regained control of the game but seemed to live rather in hope than believe in their game in the final third of the game.
Alfredo Morales certainly felt that he should have had hell when the quarter of the game was over, when he and Steven Lawless together, while Judge Steven Thomson dismissed the call of the Colombian.
Rangers only had to take two shots in the first half of the game, but Liam Kelly, former target Ibrox, did not have to have much to cover the baldness of Lassana Coulibally and an easy shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Although the opportunity of Livi in 34 minutes had come despite the fact that the other team had taken over, no one can deny that they deserved it, but only because of their perseverance.
Rangers again failed to do anything from a long time of extra effort from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his peace and chose to send to Menga, who then easily scored.
Gerrard intervened and sent Ryan Kent in instead of Coulibaly, and the shifts affected almost immediately as the rear guard entered Morelos, but Kelly reacted quickly and ran forward to close the shot.
Livingston, however, continued to fool the guests to play just the kind of game they enjoy playing, and Lithgow and Halkett reached each long shipment on their feet.
The Holts could have increased their lead on the finals, but McGregor stood by to deny Jacobs a chance before Lithgow ran to a finish from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, Ranger's deputy, wanted another hell when he and Jacobs fell down together, but Thomson referred it back.
Almanak: The man who invented the Geiger counter
Here comes a page from our calendar “Sunday Morning”: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and APHRAM... this is the day that future archaeologist John Wilhelm “Hans ” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of studying and measuring radioactivity, and that invention eventually led to a device called Geiger.
The Geiger measuring device has gained a steady position in the scientific world since then, but was also popular in pop culture, for example in 1950’s “Bells of Coronado” film, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in unlikely roles as scientists:
Man: “What in the world is that? ”
Rogers: “This is Geiger measured, used to detect radioactive substances such as uranium.
When you put these hearing aids on you, you can hear the effect of the atoms because of radioactivity in the stones."

New anticancer vaccine may teach your immune system to “see” dangerous cells
New anticancer vaccine can teach your immune system to "see" dangerous cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches your immune system to know dangerous cells as part of the treatment
The treatment involves taking immune cells from the patient and modifying them in the laboratory.
Then they can “see” proteins, which are common in many cancer cells, and are then injected back into the patient
Experimental vaccine has shown positive results in patients suffering from different types of cancer.
In one of the women who received the vaccine, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months, teaching immune cells to know dangerous cancer cells.
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can “see” proteins called HER2 and are found in many types of cancer, and then the cells are injected back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the United States Cancer Institute, Bethesday, Maryland, said: “Our downsides indicate that the vaccine is extremely effective. ”
HER2 “has caused various cancers to stop growing,” including breast cancers, ovaries, lungs, and colons and rectum, said Berzofsky, professor.
A similar method in which immune cells are taken from patients and in whom cancer cells are known to attack has been effective in the treatment of one type of leukaemia.
Kanye West held a long talk in support of Trump and carried MAGA there after appearing on the TV show SNL.
It didn't end well.
In the studio of Saturday Night Live after a long talk, Kanye West praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said that he would be presenting himself to the President in 2020.
After moving the third song of the evening, Ghost Town, where he wore the Make America Great hat, he spoke against the democrats for a long time and repeated his support at Trump.
“ I’ve talked so often to white people who say, “How can you like Trump, he’s a race hater? ”
If I were concerned about racial hatred, I would have long been moved from the United States," he said.
SNL began with a stick where Hollywood star Matt Damon made a mockery of Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Judicial Committee on the Charges for Sexual Injury by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the long - term West had not been sent out, the recording of it was put on a community media by Chris Rock.
It's not certain that Rock wanted to make fun of West by publishing the tape.
Also, West had complained to the audience that he had received bad receptions from behind because of his hating.
“ I was bullied in the back.
They said to me: “Don’t go up with this hat. ”
They bullied me!
Then they say I'm in a deep hole," he said, according to news from the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see the deep hole? ” and said that he would put on his superhero garment “because that means you can’t order me for work, so do you want the world to make progress?
"Try love."
His speech was accompanied by a crowd from the audience at least two times, and players from SNL, according to Varitety, seemed disgraceful, and one present said to the newspaper: “There was a silence in the studio. ”
West had been invited to join the show instead of the singer Ariana Grande, but her boyfriend, Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with his stage performance when he sang the song I Love it, dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from Candace Turner, chairman of TPUSA’s maintenance team, but she said on Twitter: “To one of the bravest souls: TAKING FOR THE VIEW OF MOTHERING. ”
But on Twitter, the conversational director Karen Hunter said that West was simply “being himself and it’s wonderful. ”
“But I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his “list ”) whom I feel I am supporting and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
That's us too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and said that he was now “the formerly known as Kanye West. ”
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's footsteps, which is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, has also called himself Snoop Lion and must not forget the musical myth of Prince’s title, which changed its name into a symbol and later called itself the artist who was formerly known as Prince.
Accused of a murder attempt following a knife attack at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45 - year - old man has been charged with attempted murder after being stabbed to a restaurant in the eastern part of Belfast on Tuesday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to the police.
The defendant is expected to be present at the Belfast court on Monday.
The DA will review the charges.
Kit Harington, the star of the Crown Games, criticizes poisoned male
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent adventures of HBO, the Crown Games.
The 31 - year - old player, on the other hand, has criticized the image of the male hero and says that such a role on the screen means that young boys often feel that they need to be tough in order to gain respect.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he felt that “something went wrong ” and wondered how to deal with the problem of poisoned masculinity during the #MeToo period.
Kit, who recently married his fellow woman from the Crown Games, the 31 - year - old Rose Leslie, admitted that he had “strong opinions ” on how to deal with this matter.
"Personally, at the moment, I feel like - what has gone wrong with manhood?"
"What have we taught men in their growth, about the problems we see now?"
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for increasing toxic male behavior, due to a very male personality on television.
He continued: “What is innate, and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that make young boys feel as if they must be made up of a man?
I think it's one of the most important questions of our time -- how do we change this?
Because it is obvious that something has gone wrong with young men."
During the interview, he also admitted that he would not play in any other parts of the Crown after the series similar to the next summer and said that he had received “a lot of battlefields and horses. ”
Since November Kit will be playing in the re-creating of True West, by Sam Shepard, the story of a movie producer and his robber brother.
The player recently said that the best thing about playing at the Crown Games was seeing his wife, Rose.
“ I met my wife in these things, so that they would give me some kind of future family and my life after that, ” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the lover of Jon Snow, who Kit played in these Emmy Prizes.
The couple married in June 2018, on the land of the Lesli family in Scotland.
HIV/destiny: China reports a 14% increase in new transmission
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of countries infected with the HIV virus or AIDS.
Health authorities say that over 820,000 people are infected in the country.
Some 40,000 new infections were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new infections occurred through sex, which is a change from the past.
Previously, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to the administration of infected blood.
The number of people infected with the HIV virus in this way, however, has fallen to almost zero, as Chinese healthcare professionals said at a conference in the Yunnan region.
However, the number of people infected with the HIV virus or AIDS has increased by 100,000 people from year to year.
HIV transmission due to sex is a serious problem within the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been illegal in China since 1997, but large differences in LGBT are still reported.
Based on conservative values in the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who engage in sex with other humans marry eventually.
Many are infected by inadequate contraception in these marriages.
As of 2003, the Chinese government has promised access to all HIV drugs as part of the strategy to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has leaked data from the Senate members of the Republic, criticises "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy"
On Saturday, a congressman Maxine Waters, denied the accusation that one of her employees had published personal information to three members of the Republican Senate on their Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat of Los Angeles said that these statements came from “superhighly inclined ” extremes and Web sites.
"Lying, lying, and more pathetic lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The information published included, according to the addresses and phone numbers of Utah Utah Utah Utah Utany’s Utah Senators Lindsey Graham and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch.
The information was published on the Internet on Thursday by an unknown party on Capitol Hill during hearings at Brett Kavanaugh’s Senate, appointed Supreme Court judge, on the grounds of sexual charges.
The lesson came some time after the three Senators had interrogated Kavanaugh.
Content pages such as Gateway Pundit and RedState said that the IP numbers that identify the source of the information were linked to the Waters office and published information about one of its employees, according to information from Capitol Hill.
“This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and pure lies,” continued Waters.
“My employee – what personal information and security are now at risk because of these wrong allegations – was not in any way responsible for this information campaign.
This unbridled accusation is completely false and pure lies."
Water’s statement was quickly criticised on the Internet, including Ara Fleischer, former White House reporter.
"This denial is full of anger," wrote Fleischer.
“ This suggests that she does not have the courage to sit at a council.
When someone is accused for no reason, do not react with anger.
There is no resistance.
This should not be questioned for reasons of accusation.
There must be calmness and meditation."
Fleischer seemed to compare the reaction of Waters to the critics ’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who claimed that the critics had seemed too angry at the trial on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, the provocative Republicans against Waters in the mid - term review, also commented on Twitter.
"The big thing if it is true," he gasped.
In his declaration, Waters said that her office had been “informed by these untrue statements by appropriate authorities and law - enforcement officers.
'We shall ensure that the guilty are found,' she continued, 'and that they shall be brought to justice for all acts of defamation and peril for all my servants.'
A movie critic for Johnny English Strikes again - a spy movie with Rowan Atkinson
It has become common practice to look for Brexit references in all new films where Britain is concerned, and this seems to be the case in this revival of the Johnny English comic book series - which started in 2003 with the picture Johnny English and just woke up to life again in 2011 with the picture Johnny English Reborn.
Will this scrutinizing satirah as to how clearly we are a new means of exporting the country?
Whether that is the case or not, the desolate, gregarious, and clumsy Johnny English have been granted a second time permission to mess everything up — his name shows above all that he is designed for a demonstration in non - English - speaking lands.
He is, of course, the clever secret serviceman who pretends to have charming personalities but is a bit of a mix of Clouseau, that of Mr. Bean and a little deleted by the man who played one note for the Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony in London in 2012.
He is also originally based on the tourist and the mysterious world citizen who Atkinson once played in the forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, where he left everything behind in chaos.
There's one or two good points in this latest Johnny English picture.
I enjoyed watching Johnny English walk to a helicopter dressed in a middle - age bar and the helicopter leaves in his helmet.
Atkinson clearly shows his humorousness, but the humor seems rather powerless and strangely superficial, especially now when “serious ” movies such as James Bond and Mission Impossible also offer hilarious jokes.
The joke seems rather for children than adults, and I found the adventures that Johnny English had not as imaginative and focused as the silences of Atkinson's grinsticks in Mr. Beans' fake.
The ever - increasing assumption of this picture is that Britain is in a lot of trouble.
A computer hacker has managed to break into Britain’s secret spy network and reveal the identity of all British spies, to the great dismay of the spy on the watch — but unfortunately Kevin Eldon is too small a role.
This is the final straw for the Prime Minister, who is arrogant and disputing and who is already in great trouble because of huge political hostilities: Emma Thompson is doing his best with his role as a person who should be reminded of Theresa May, but the manuscript is not on many fish for her.
Her counselors tell her that all active spies are in danger and that she must find someone who had already sat on a sacred stone.
And there's Johnny English himself, now a headmaster of some fine school, but he also teaches a secret lesson in how to be a spy: here are some funny jokes English offers a spy school that reminds of the school of Rock.
English is called back to Whitehall at an emergency meeting, where Bough, formerly a long - tired partner, who is playing Ben Miller again.
Bough is now a married man, his wife is a submarine master, but in that energetic role Vicki Pepperdine does not quite let his light shine.
The spy venture that crumbles everything in her service to Her Majesty is now returned to the garrison and meets Ophelia Bulletova, who is played by Olgu Kurylenko.
At the same time, the prime minister is apprehensive about the charms of the billionaires of technology, who claim to be capable of solving computer problems in Britain: this is the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their decline: they set off in a fine French restaurant disguised as servants, they make a mess when they smuggle into Volta’s luxury hub, and English turns everything upside down when he tries to use virtual spectacle glasses to explore the interior of Volta’s house.
There is nothing left to spare in that final point, but although the image is bold and energetic, some of the baby stuff in it as a whole is humiliated.
Medium-yielding material.
And just as with the other Johnny English pictures, I couldn't help thinking, can a British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really fits his skills?
The work force denies that it is preparing a four - day schedule for the UK, with the same salary as for five days a week.
The team of workers, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is now considering a radical plan that would allow the British to work for four days a week, but get paid for five.
According to the report, the group wants companies to make savings from the revolution, and employees benefit by having one extra day off.
At that time, employees could spend three days on weekends without paying any salary.
Sources say that the idea would be "matched" with the Group's financial programme and its policy of improving the benefits of the workforce.
Trade Union Congress has been supporting the reduction of the working week for four days, leading workers to benefit from economic change.
A source from the Upper Workers ’ Party said to the Sunday Times: “It is estimated that policy reviews will be reported by the end of the year.
"The change will not take place overnight, but four-day working weeks is a goal appropriate to the approach of the group to change the economy to the benefit of the workforce and to the overall industrial policy of the group."
The working class would not be the first class to support this idea, but the Green Group promised four days of work in its 2017 campaign.
The objective, however, is not supported by the Working Party as a whole.
The Workers ’ Group spokesperson said: “Four days of working week is not on the group’s policy paper and the group is not considering introducing it. ”
John McDonnell, secretary - general of the Shadow Ministry, used the Workers ’ Party Conference last week to describe his ideas about social revolution within the economy.
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to regain power from 'unknown leaders' and 'growths'.
The shadow minister's plans also mean that the current shareholders in water companies may not be able to recover their entire share, since the Workers' Group's government could resort to a "burden" because of misdeeds.
It has also confirmed plans to put employees on the board of management committees and to create a common fund of ownership to provide 10 percent of the property to their employees, who could receive 500 pounds of them annually in their pocket.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 minutes" whether an FBI study at Kavanaugh could get them to change their mind
A study by the FBI on the accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has caused at least a week’s delay in the final vote on his appointment as Supreme Court judge, raising the question as to whether her findings might have the Republican Senate members withdraw their support.
During an interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley, a reporter on the 60 - minute episode of the Republicans and Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, asked if the FBI could reveal something that would change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his college from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“ I said when the trial started, I said I was talking to Judge Kavanaughh.
I called him after the charges were filed and asked, “Did you do this? ”
He was determined, firm, undivided."
Graham’s vote, however, seems unalterable.
“ I’ve made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and it would require an incredible accusation to change it, ” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett firmly denied it," Graham added, addressing Christine Blasey Ford.
“ And everyone she mentioned by name could not confirm it.
This case is 36 years old.
I can't see anything new will change."
What is the International Civil Festival, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival (Global Citizen Festival) will be held on Saturday in New York City, an annual music event in which a series of great stars will be presented and with an equally influential course; ending poverty worldwide.
This is the seventh year of the International Civil Festival, and tens of thousands of people will be invited to Central Park, not only to listen to music from among others Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to draw attention to the real goal of the festival of ending the severe poverty by 2030.
The World Civil Festival, first held in 2012, is part of the Global Power Project, which is an international combat organization that wants to end poverty by increasing the number of those who are fighting it.
In order to receive free tickets to the event (except for those who want to pay for the VIP ticket), musicians had to complete various tasks, or “actions”, such as working on a volunteer, sending e-mails to some of the world’s leaders, calling calls, or using other valid ways of helping to draw attention to their goals of ending poverty.
But how successful has the festival been, now that 12 years have been, to reach its goal?
Is the idea that awarding people with free concerts is really a way to convince people to call for action, or is it just one so - called "smelting" operation - where people feel that it does something that matters by signing a list of requirements on the Internet or sending messages on Twitter?
Global Citizen reports that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million “actions ” from its supporters, calling for many different goals.
It says that these actions have helped to get world leaders to declare commitments and policies that amount to over $35 billion that will affect the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
Early in 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and announcements for its operations, of which at least 10 billion have been invested or collected.
The group estimates that the amount of money that will be collected up here has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the principal commitments comes from The Power of Nutrition, a company of investors and executives in Britain who work “to help children enjoy their full potential,” promising to provide 35 million dollars to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country, after receiving 4700 messages from Global Citizens on Twitter.
“With the support of the British government, the sponsors, governments around the world and international cities like you, we can leave the social injustice of the past to which malnutrition belongs,” said Tracey Ullmann, representative of The Power of Nutrition at the audiences at London concerts in April 2018.
The group also said that after 5000 appeals were sent that Britain should improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for projects, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children and provide them with better nutrition.
On the group’s website, one of the common questions is: “Why do you think you can put an end to severe poverty? ”
Global citizen replied: “It’s going to be a long and difficult task - sometimes we’re going to fail all the time.
But, like movements fought for the rights of citizens and the abstinence from racial separation before us, we will achieve our goal, for we are stronger together.
Among the events this year are Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monae. The event will be held in New York and the students will be Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a 'hidden' to prevent Russia's energy exports, says the Minister of the Interior.
"If necessary," Washington could use the Navy to prevent Russia from reaching the market, including the Middle East, says Ryan Zincke, U.S. Secretary of State, according to a Washington Examiner report.
Zinke argued that Russia’s aid to Syria, especially since it works in the invitation of the legal government there, would be a model to explore new markets.
"I think the reason for their existence in the Middle East is that they want to do business with energy like in Eastern Europe and its southern parts," he said according to the sources.
And, according to a public notice, there are ways and methods to resist it.
“The United States can use the Navy to ensure that sea routes are opened and to create obstacles, if necessary, to ensure that the energy from them does not come on the market, ” he said.
Zinke addressed a guest meeting at the Consumer Energy Alliance, a charity group called the “Red Energy Dance ” in the United States.
He continued and brought Washington closer together to deal with Russia and Iran and told her to be more or less the same.
“The economic choice for Iran and Russia is more and less the use of energy supplies and to replace them with others,” he said, saying, “and he said that Russia has only one card in its sleeve with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements are followed by the fact that Trump's management wants to increase its export to Europe of natural gas and replace Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, the members of Trump’s government, and including President Donald Trump himself, have tried to get Germany to stop participating in the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 project to put a new power line, which Trump says would make Berlin a “capture ” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly argued that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 power supply, which will double the current transport capacity of the current route to 110 billion square feet [110 billion m], is only a economic task.
Russians say that Washington’s strong opposition to the project is simply for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
“ I believe that energy should not be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the supplies,” said Alexander Novak, Russian Energy Minister after a meeting with Rick Perry, US Energy Minister, in Moscow in September.
The state of the United States has been criticized by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Federation of German Industries (BDI) has called on the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I am very dissatisfied with the fact that our foreign power is changing," said Dieter Kempf, president of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting recently held with Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany, and Vladimir Putin, president of Russia.
Elizabeth Warren will “consider seriously” to present himself to the office of President in 2020, she says.
On Saturday Elizabeth Warren, Senator of Massachusetts, said that she would “consider seriously ” to present herself to the president after the mid - term poll.
Warren confirmed that she would consider inviting herself to a civil meeting at Holyoke, Massachusetts.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and join our government, and then a woman as a leader, too,” she said, according to a report from The Hill.
“After November 6th, I will consider seriously presenting myself to the President’s office. ”
Speaking of President Donald Trump at the meeting, Warren said that he was “leaving the country in the wrong direction.
“I’m very worried about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy, ” she said.
Warren has ignored his criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his appointed Supreme Court judge.
On Friday, Warren said on Twitter: “Of course we have to have the FBI investigate the matter before the vote is taken. ”
However, a survey published on Thursday shows that the majority of the electorate in Warren’s state do not believe that it should present itself in 2020.
Fifty - eight percent of the “probable ” voter in Massachusetts said that the Senator should not present himself, according to a poll published by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty - two percent said they supported her offer.
The survey showed greater support for the presentation of Deval Patrick, former governor, where 38 percent claimed to support his potential donation, and 48 percent claimed to oppose it.
Among other popular democrats who were discussed for possible presidential election in 2020 were Joe Biden, former vice president, and Bernie Sanders, senator from Vermont.
Biden said that he was going to make a public decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin speaks of a crisis disorder Track Palin at a election meeting at Donald Trump
The 26 - year - old track Palin was in Iraq for one year after joining the army in September.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night
“My son is going through a lot of trouble after coming back, I feel with other families who are affected by the stress and spiritual wounds our soldiers return home with,” she said to the audience at a election meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “the elephant in the room ” and said that her son and other warriors“ came back only differently, they are hardened and wonder if there is any respect for what their military and air forces and other military units have done for the country. ”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, of trying to block home violence announcements, and of being under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and Washington D.C. support a challenge against a new policy of asylum seekers
Eighteen states and Washington City support a legal challenge to the new policy of the United States which refuses victims who flee gang or home violence for refuge.
Branch 18 agents and the city sent a report on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who opposed the course, according to a report from NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions of the petition submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy has not been given up.
She said that her spouse “and his violent sons, who were members of the gang, ” was violent, but on July 20, U.S. officials rejected her application for refuge.
She was detained in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as countries where problems related to gangs and domestic violence are constantly increasing, and the number of asylum seekers in the United States comes from these countries.
The new asylum policy revokes a decision that the IPR had made in 2014 to allow unregistered immigrants who fled from domestic violence to apply for refuge.
Mr Racine, D.C. State Attorney Karl Racine, announced on Friday that the new policy “regarded more decades of federal and international law. ”
"Federal laws require a decision to be made on all detention applications based on the facts and circumstances of the application, and this policy violates this rule," said the Court of Justice.
In the report, the law further stated that the policy that refused immigrants was harmful to the economy of the United States, claiming that immigrants were more likely to set up a business and “provide important jobs. ”
Jeff Sessions, a government prosecutor, ordered immigrants to stop sheltering victims who fled from domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Those who leave their home country because of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular community or political opinion can apply for refuge,” said Sessions in their announcement on June 11.
Intruders were never meant to solve all the problems, not even all the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue operations in the race to find survivors in Palu, who speak the dead twice as much
Conditions are becoming increasingly difficult for survivors.
“There’s a lot of excitement in the air,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, who comforted her sick son at the relief center in the city of Palau.
“Cars bring their bodies here all the time.
There's little clean water."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their devastated homes and looking in their waters to try to save what they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and hospitals were overcrowded and damaged by the earthquake measuring 7.5 points on the Richter scale.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who broke back and shoulder, lay outside the Palu military hospital, where patients were invited outside due to continued vigorous exaggeration.
His eyes were filled with tears when he told him how he found the earthquake shaking his hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
“ There was no time to save ourselves.
I pushed up to the murals, I think," said Haris to the Associated Press and said that his family had been in town to go to the wedding.
“ I heard my wife call for help, but then for silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
United States Secretary of State for China's "punishment" of "punishment"
Week after a public newspaper in China published a four - page advertisement in the U.S. newspaper to discuss mutual benefits in trade between the two countries, the ambassadors of the United States of China accused Beijing of using the U.S. media to spread propaganda.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, spoke the last Wednesday about Chinese newspaper advertising in the Des Moines Register, which is the most widely sold news magazine in Iowa, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the United States' throng elections that will take place on November 6, China rejects this accusation.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing wanted to intervene in the U.S. congresses marked what official U.S. agents said Reuter’s news office was a new stage in an increasing campaign from Washington to use China’s pressure.
Although it is natural for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote business, Beijing and Washington have a hard - to - do business war, with new customs duties on both countries’ imports.
Chinese and American experts say that early in the business war, China’s guilds were designed to harm displaced persons in states such as Iowa, who supported the Trump Republics.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador in China and former governor of Iowa for the long time, but it carries out much of the agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers, and businesses.
Branstad, in her introduction to the Sunday newspaper Des Moines Register, said that “China is now increasing its persecution by publishing propaganda messages in our own free media. ”
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the United States’ love of free speech and our free media by publishing the expensive advertising in the Des Moines Register,” said Branstad in his article.
“ On the other hand, few protesters can be found in newspapers on the streets of Beijing, and no true reflection can be found on the differing views that China could have on worrying China’s economy, where the media are trapped under the heel of the Chinese Communist Party, ” he wrote.
He added that “one of the greatest news reports in China came out of the invitation to publish ” his article, but he did not explain what form it was.
Experts warn that the Republicans are making female voters defy them for the mid-term review of the Kavanaugh case.
Experts have warned of negative reactions, especially from women, in the next mid - term reviews, because many Republicans have supported and defended Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court judge, who has accepted the charges of sexual harassment.
Most Republicans have already shown publicly that they wanted to start a vote.
"These things cannot be backed up," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell School, University of Syracuse, at The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said that he had no doubt called on Jeff Flake, the senator of the Republicans of Arizona, in the last minute of an investigation by the FBI to calm down voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow and not November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, Chief Adviser and spokesperson for the liberal group MoveOn, on Friday, according to Washington D.C.
On Friday morning the Protestants sang “November Approached ” when they protested the elders ’ walk when the Republicans who ruled the Committee decided to continue with the nomination of Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
"The interest and enthusiasm of the electorate will go out of hand," said Stu Rothenberg, regardless of the political party, at the news cover page.
“ People will say that the interest has already been great, and it is true.
But he might be greater, especially with female voters in the suburbs and younger electors, 18-29 years old, who like the president, than rarely choose."
The analysts predicted a setback if the Republicans pressed for confirmation of Kavanaugh, even for Ford’s testimony, as she described her accusation of sexual assault from him.
“This is a big mess for the Republic group,” said Michael Still, former member of the Republic Group’s National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"The matter is not just about the committee's vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is allowed to sit on the bench, it is also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they have dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, president of Priories USA, a group helping to vote for Democrats, at the news station.
However, it seems that the United States disagrees with who should believe after witnessing from both Ford and Kavanaugh, and a few people support the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of the respondents certainly believed, or likely believed, the witness from Ford, while 35 percent claimed to believe in the likely or probable testimony of Kavanaughh.
In addition, 38 percent of the respondents said that they thought Kavanaugh was probably or certainly lying in his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After the Flake appeal, the FBI is now investigating Ford's allegations from at least one other woman, Deboruh Ramirez, reported by Guardian.
Ford testified to the Senate Committee last week and said that Kavanaugh had attacked her when she was 17 years old and that he had been under the influence of alcohol.
Ramirez says that Kavanaugh wore his genitals in front of her when they were both at a party at Yale University in the ’ 90 ’ s.
The man who invented the Internet has plans to start a new Internet to fight against Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the man who invented the Internet, is going to set up a sprot company to fight against Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the technical mythology, Inrupt, is a company based on Solid, open-ended Berners-Lee.
Solid enables users to choose where their data are stored and which people are allowed to access any information.
In a private interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee in a joke said that the intent behind Inrupt was “home governance.”
"We have to do this now," he said about the explosives company.
"This is a historic moment."
The program uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own “personal online data store ” or POD.
You can find a list of contacts, todo lists, calendars, music collections, and other personal and work related devices.
It looks like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all in one browser and all at the same time.
The unique thing about the personal data store is that it is completely up to the user who can access any information.
The company calls it a ‘personal choice by using data’.
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, Inrupt is the idea that the company provides resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid accessible to all.
Now the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security firm purchased by IBM, a number of programmers who were recruited as a contractor to work on the project, and a group of volunteer developers.
As of this week, technology developers around the world could create their own independent software with tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not have talks with “Facebook and Google about whether to initiate a complete change that would put their current business model on their heads overnight.
"We don't ask them permission."
Berners-Lee wrote in an article published on Saturday at Medium that Inrupt had the aim of “creating energy in business and eco-systems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new website based on Solid.”
Berners-Lee changed the Internet in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on grid neutrality.
Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation of the Open Data Institute, even while he comes up inrupt.
"I am full of optimism for the next period of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The clergy and the arrest of the Victorian Cross from World War I honored
The only English priest to be honored with the Victorian Cross during World War I as a soldier has been hailed in his hometown 100 years later.
Special Bernard Vann, who held the position of captain of the army, received the cross on September 29, 1918, in the attack on Bellengise and Lehaucourt.
On the other hand, four days later, a shooter killed him, and he never learned that he had received the highest level of honor from the British army.
His two grandkids exposed memories of him in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his great - grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was “wonderfully symbolic ” that the memorial was exposed exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s execution of honor.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Vann led his sub-chief army over the Canal de Saint-Quentin ditch “through a very thick fog and under heavy gun attack from guns and machine guns.”
Later, he ran to the line of fire, and with “great courage, ” he continued the line before he attacked a cannon of his own and defeated three soldiers.
Under - Colonel was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, only a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather was “something I could never do, but something that makes you humble. ”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a flower crown after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt “a great privilege to take part in the parade ” and added that“ a pair of true heroes are shown with the support that so many show. ”
MMA fans woke up all night watching Bellator 206 instead of seeing Gurra pig
Just imagine, having woken up all night to see the overcrowded Bellator 206, just to be denied the main event.
The program included 13 battle days from San Jose, six of them on the main record, and they were broadcast live all night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to fight, British viewers received an unexpected event when the broadcast turned into Gurra pig.
Some were unhappy after waking up all night to watch the fight.
One fan at Twitter described the transition to the subject as “any kind of sick joke. ”
“According to official regulations, the audience was not qualified at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children’s subjects,” said Dave Schwartz, vice president of the market and communications for Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Gurry pig, yes."
Scott Coker, director of Bellator, said they'd go over their time schedules and take the British viewers into account in the future.
"I think when I think about the replay we could probably solve this," Coker said.
“ But it is 6 a.m. on Sunday, and we cannot solve this until Sunday, which is a Monday for them.
But we're working on this.
Believe me, when the broadcast was changed, a lot of text messages were sent back and forth, and they were not all friendly.
We were trying to fix this, we thought this was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a public problem.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We limit the night to five battles instead of six, as usual, but we tried too much and passed.
It's a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “poor” because of sexual orientation
The Olympic dungeon Tom Daley claims to have felt discontented with other people in their upbringing because of their sexual orientation, but he was urged to succeed.
The 24 - year - old Daley said that he did not realize that “he was different ” until he attended high school.
On the radio show Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, with Lauren Laverne, Daley said that he was talking about the rights of homosexuals to give others “hope. ”
He also said that his parent’s role had diminished his interest in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the general manager, has taken several months off because of illness.
Daley showed up outside in Lavarne for the first time and said that he felt he was a "small man" but everyone else when he was a child because "it was not agreed in society to like both boys and girls."
“ Until today, ” he said, “these feelings of feeling have given me the strength and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was “something, ” he said, so that at the end of the day, he would not disappoint anyone.
Two times the Olympic Bronze Creator has been very supportive of LGBT and used his participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more nations to legalize homosexuality.
He said that he was lucky to be able to live publicly without punishment and wanted to “hope ” others.
The world champion three times said that it had been “a surprise ” to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he first met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When a man goes through so much at a young age" - but he participated in his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find peers who had experienced similar success and difficulties.
The couple adopted a child in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his “all the views of life ” had been blatant.
"If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning a gold prize," he said.
“ Know what, there are more important things than gold prizes at the Olympics.
Robbie is my Olympic Gold Prize."
His son was baptized in the head of Robert, his father who died in 2011, aged 40, after having been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would die, and one of the last things he had asked was whether they had already received their tickets for London in 2012 — because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“ I couldn’t tell him that he wouldn’t live long enough to sit in the front row, ” he said.
“ I held my hand to him when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until his breath stopped, and he was let that I finally admitted that he was not invincible, ” he said.
Next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze prize.
“ I just knew that I had dreamed of this all my life, to dive in front of the audiences at the Olympic Games, and that doesn’t feel any better, ” he said.
It was also inspired to choose on the first song -- Proud by Heather Small -- who had inspired him to the Olympics and still gave him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 a.m.
Mickelson in bad shape and dead sitting on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will beat the record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he needs to find his old beat so that the valuation is not surrounded by bad memories.
Mickelson, who plays in the competition for the 12th time, who is rated, was allowed to sit on the bench after the decision of President Jim Fury for the four-ball and four-game competitions on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the hare, as he has so often been for the United States, the day of five times the master alternates between being cheerleaders and practicing the playthings on the field in hopes of correcting what is wrong with him.
Mickelson, 48 years old, was never the one who shot straight with the kid, and is not the best player for the Le Golf National golf course, since long glamour often punishes for bad shots.
And not enough that the golf course is a big challenge in itself, but Mickelson must compete against Frances Molinari, the winner of the British Open, in the ninth game on Sunday. Molinari is with the rookie Tommy Fleetwood team and together they have won all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points below, take the first of 12 solo games, get a good start, Mickelson’s game could change.
Fury expressed confidence in his husband, but he could hardly say much else.
“ He completely understood the role he had today, clapping my back and hugging my arm and saying he would be ready tomorrow, ” said Fury.
“ He has great confidence.
He's at the famous palace, and he's been so much better this week before and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I saw more, but this ended, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo in the number of players playing in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a process in the Ryder Cup, which has never achieved exactly as high a performance on its file.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses, and 7 draw, but Fury said that his presence had a vague effect on the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcasm, he's hijacked, likes to make fun of people, and it's great to have him in the joint room," he explained.
“ I think the younger players enjoyed teasing him, too, this week, and it was fun to see.
He's giving so much more than just the golf game."
Thomas Bjorn, President of Europe knows that a great deal of advantage can disappear quickly
The European President Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that a good start for the last day of the individual contest in Ryder Cup can easily turn into unpleasant experiences.
The Dane played first in Valderrama in 1997, where a side under the leadership of the president Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but achieved the right to win at the end with a minimum score difference, with a 141⁄2-131⁄2 win.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a lot of advantage in Valderrama, we had a lot of headway in Brookline where we lost and in Valderrama, where we worked, but only just like that,” said Bjorn, who was shown here, after watching the 2018 vintage, working 5-3 both Friday and Saturday and reaching the lead 10-6 on the Le Golf National Field.
History will show me and everyone in the team that this isn't over.
We'll do our best tomorrow.
Let's go do everything right.
This is not done until all the levels are stated on the tablet.
We have our goals, and it's trying to win this cup, we focus on them.
I've always said this, I focus on the 12 players in our team, but we're very aware of our opponents in the other team -- the best golfer in the world."
“ I will never go beyond myself in this, ” Bjorn was most pleased with the way his players had stood in a difficult way.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow, it is the performance of the individuals that matters, and it is another thing.
It's great to play with a partner when everything goes well, but when you play alone, you're trying on all people's talent as a golfer.
It is the message that must be sent to the players, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he also has to play his best game on his own."
Unlike Bjorn, his hostilities, Jim Fury, will strive for his players to be better off in individuals than with companions, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Fury himself has experienced both sides of this great change last day, but he was victorious with his team in Brookline but ended up losing when Europe carried out “the miracle in Medinah. ”
"I remember every goddamn word," he asked how Ben Crenshaw, the president in 1999, had encouraged his players on the last day.
“We need to play 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start quickly as happened in Brookline and Medinah.
When it comes to building up, it causes a lot of pressure on the games that are in the center.
We arranged our players according to it and let them play like we think it's going to be best tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the defense and play against Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahman, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other European players in the first half of the game.
“I chose these players in this row because I think they’ll cover all the way through,” Bjorn said about their choice of players in the individual competition.
A New German Army Ship Rebuffed
The German Navy’s most recent warship should have been built in 2014 to replace an old warship from the Cold War period, but it will not be ready until the next year, as reported by the news in the area, due to the failure of the system and the increasing cost.
The building of the ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the leader of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg army, has now been postponed to the previous half of 2019, according to the sources of the military spokesman who spoke to the Die Zeit newspaper.
The ship should have benefited the Navy in 2014, but serious problems after the ship was delivered.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 are to replace the Bremen-class ships that have arrived in their years.
They're supposed to be equipped with a more powerful cannon, a lot of anti-aircraft and ship-to-air missiles and hide technology such as reduced radar infrared, and sound signals.
Other important properties are longer use time - it should be possible to use the latest ships for up to two years away from their home ports.
However, it means that these ships of the latest type - which are said to enable Germany to show its strength on the ocean - will become obsolete when they are finally taken into service, says Die Zeit.
The F125 arrived in the news last year when the German army publicly refused to accept the fleece and returned it to the Blohm & Voss release in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has returned the ship to the manufacturer after the sale.
The reasons behind divorce were not known, but German media spoke of a number of women as serious “deficiency in software and machinery ” that would render the military useless if it was sent to war.
Software failures were particularly important as a Baden-Wuerttemberg-class warship will be operated by 120 crews, which is half the size of Bremen ships.
It was also found that the ship was too heavy, reducing its performance and limiting the ability of the Navy to improve it in the future.
The 7000-tonne 'Rheinland-Pfalz' ship is considered to be twice as heavy as a ship of a similar class to that used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to faults in machinery, the cost of the entire project - including the training of the ship - is causing problems.
It is said to have reached EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion), but originally it was EUR 2.2 billion.
Problems affecting the most recent ships are particularly important in view of the warning that German superiority is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the National Defence Committee of Germany, admitted that the Navy was actually becoming “a ship capable of operation.”
The representative said that the problem had surfaced over time, for older ships were taken out of service, but no ships came in their place.
He lamented that none of the orders of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be used by the Navy.
The National Trust Nature Conservation Organization is spying on the secret life of bats
A new study on land in the Scottish Highlands aims at finding out how bats use the landscape when fishing for food.
It is hoped that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help to guide future conservation measures.
The study, led by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland Nature Conservation Organization, will monitor different types of bats in the Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross.
Specific recording devices will be installed in the key locations around the area to monitor the behaviour of the leather blades over the period.
Staff of NHS and volunteers will also be monitored by handheld sensors.
Experts will sound all recordings to find the frequency and type of what the bats give off.
Map of habitats and reports will then be published to provide an accurate picture of their behaviour on a geographical scale.
Rob Dewar, the NTS National Council for Nature Conservation, hopes that the results will reveal what kind of habitat is most important to the bats and how they are used in each species.
This information will help to determine the cost of farm management, e.g. by creating meadows and how best to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom, bats have decreased significantly in the last century.
They are at risk from construction and development projects that affect their nests and reduce their habitat.
Windmills and light can also cause risks, including fly papers and certain construction materials, as well as domestic vehicle attacks.
Bats are not really blind.
On the other hand, their ears benefit much more than their eyes when they catch prey because they are used to hunting at night.
They used sophisticated rock - mining technology to locate insects and objects on their flight path.
NTS, responsible for maintaining over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 hectares of land all over the country, take bats very seriously.
In the organizations, ten experts who carry out regular examinations, nesting reviews, and sometimes rescue operations work.
The association has even established the first and only Batteries of Scotland with the Threeave Farm in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight out of ten bats of Scotland have their home.
David Thompson, a ranch overseer, says that he is a perfect territory for them.
"The area here at Threeave is great for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, plenty of growing trees and plenty of good living areas.
But there is still much unknown about bats, so the work we do here and in other places will help us to understand more fully what they need to clean up."
He stressed the importance of examining bats before they are maintained, since the potential accidental destruction of a single nest can kill up to 400 female bats and young people and destroy all the bats in the area.
Bats are protected, and killing, harassing, or disrupting their nests is forbidden.
A Scottish representative at Bat Conservation Trust, Elisabeth Ferrell, has encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about bats, and we don’t know how many of their species are doing. ”
Ronaldo denies the accusation of rape when lawyers prepare a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has accused him of raping “false news ” and says that people want to“ pay attention to themselves ” by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, who published the accusations.
The Portuguese and Juventus campaigner has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to Der Spiegel’s report on Friday, he is said to have paid her $375,000 later for shutting down the incident.
A few hours after the accusations were published, Ronaldo, 33 years old, said in a Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers that they were “false news. ”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What was said today is false news," said the world champion five times to the camera.
“ These people want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
It wants to be famous by using my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player smiling.
Ronaldos’ lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the charges, which they have termed “inadequate disclosure of private suspicions, ” according to Reuter’s news agency.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that Ronaldo would demand compensation for “a pain of the same magnitude as the seriousness of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years. ”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and the Las Vegas casino.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he was supposed to have raped her in the rectum, according to documents filed for the Clark County of Nevada.
Mayorga says that Ronaldo kneeled after a civil incident and told her that he was a "99 percent good man" who had fallen into temptation because of the "one percent."
The papers say that Ronaldo agreed that the couple had sex but that it was agreed by both parties.
Mayorga argues that she went to the police and had her injuries taken in the hospital, but finally agreed to an extra-judicial agreement because she was “afraid of retaliation” and was concerned about becoming “depressed publicly.”
She says she wants to stop the sweets because she's still in shock after an accident.
Ronaldo was close to going to Real Madrid from Manchester United when rape was scheduled to take place, and in some cases he went to the Italian giant Juve with a 100 million euro deal.
Brexit: Britain would “look after forever” losing car manufacturers
Britain would ‘ regret it forever’ if it lost its position as an international leader among car manufacturers after Brexit, says Greg Clark, Minister of Business.
He added that it was “anxious” that Toyota UK had said to the BBC that if Britain were to leave the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily cease manufacturing at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that if Brexit without a contract would be a real - life job, the effect would be to delay our borders.
The Burnaston factory, which manufactures Toyota Auris and Avensis automobiles, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were moved to other EU countries.
"It is my opinion that if Britain shrinks from the EU by the end of March, we will see the manufacturing sites in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota, Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have expressed concerns about exit from the EU without agreement on how inter-country trade should take place, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW claims to close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is that if Brexit becomes a reality without a contract, what car manufacturers say is a risk of bias.
The Toyota production line is based on the 'last hour' reception, where parts are delivered every 37 minutes from both UK and EU supply for vehicles manufactured after ordering.
If the UK declines without an agreement on 29 March, the industry may find that there may be disruptions to the national borders that the industry considers may lead to loss of ownership.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day's sleeper in its factory in Derbyshire, said the company, so production would stop.
Mr Clark said that the Theresa May Chequers programme for future relations with the EU 'was specifically aimed at preventing these views at the border.'
“We must have a deal; we want to get the best deal that enables us not only to enjoy success today but as an opportunity that we can take advantage of,” he said on the BBC Radio 4.
“ The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, shows that we must be able to continue with very effective approaches.
Toyota could not tell us how long their production would last, but for a long time it was not possible to reduce the cost of the factory’s competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years as a factory confidant, said that his colleagues are ever more concerned: “My experience is that when these jobs are gone, they will never return.
The government spokesperson said: “We have presented an accurate and comprehensive plan for our future relationship with the EU. ”
Findings between Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House.
The White House declared on Sunday that an important meeting between Donald Trump and Rod Rosenstein, assistant state prosecutor, could be “re-released by one week” now the dispute over Brett Kavanaugh, a nominated Supreme Court judge, continues.
Rosenstein supervises the work of Robert Mueller, a special prosecutor, who investigates Russian elections, links between Trump’s assistants and Russia, and possible obstacles to the progress of the President’s justice.
For weeks stories have been going on in Washington as to whether Trump will run an assistant state attorney and thus jeopardize Mueller’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times said that Rosenstein had discussed carrying a recording device to open a conversation with Trump and the possibility to roll the president out of office using the 25th additional section of the government file.
Rosenstein denied these statements.
Last Monday, however, he visited the White House, among other things a report that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump on Thursday, then he was with the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that he wanted to run Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed so that he was not heard at the same time by the Senate Judicial Committee, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who filed for sexual assault, witnessed both.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation by the FBI into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which postponed the vote of the Senate.
Sarah Sander, the media agent for Trump, was on a broadcast on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “There has not been a date for him, it could be this week, and I think it may be postponed for a second week because of everything else going on at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I'm always happy to inform the media."
Some reporters disagree with this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
The correspondent Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that a small number of meetings were not because of dissatisfaction with television reporters who had “visualism, ” but she said:“ I don’t disagree with the fact that they have vision. ”
It then indicated that direct communication between Trump and the media would increase.
'The President answers more questions on the media than any other president has ever done before,' she said, without referring to the sources: 'We have gone over these figures.'
According to Sanders, “if the media have the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it is far better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot of it and you've seen us do a lot of it over the past few weeks and it'll replace media meetings when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions as he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or media meetings with other leaders who visit him.
Media meetings with him alone are rare.
The president may have shown why in New York this week, when he showed himself out of control and in times of strange behavior in front of a group of reporters.
Minister of Health writes to EU health care professionals in Scotland because of Brexit concern
The Minister of Health has written to staff from the EU who work within the healthcare system in Scotland (NHS Scotland) to express their gratitude for the nation and wish it to continue working after Brexit has gone through.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter within six months until Britain leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already promised to face costs due to requests for EU staff working within the public service sector.
Ms. Freeman wrote in his letter: “For the summer, discussions between the UK and the EU have continued due to a decision and are expected to be decided in the fall.
The British Government has also prepared a contract if it is not possible.
I know this must be a lot of uncertainty for all of you.
That is why I would like to state again how much I value the work of all the employees, no matter what their nationality is.
The European Union and its Member States have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health services and provide benefits for the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we want you to stay here very much."
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after having had a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a lineman for Tennessee State Tigers, had to undergo emergency surgery after having had a head injury in a 31-27 losing game against the team Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, according to a report from Mike Organ, journalist Tennessee.
Rod Reed, head coach of Tennessee State, told the reporters that the injury had happened shortly before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and fell down there," said Reed.
Coaches and paramedics gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before he was placed on the sideline and carried out for closer observation.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris, radio operator of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had an operation at the hospital in Vanderbilt.
Harris added that there was “no information on the type or severity of the impact yet ” and that Tennessee State was trying to find out when the accident occurred.
Abercrombie, who is last year at school, plays his first season with Tennessee State after leaving Illinois.
He had five totals on Saturday before he left, which raised his total number of hits to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp fees when they buy real estate in Britain
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamping fees when buying real estate in Britain.
The operation will undo the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
Raised stamps will be placed on those who do not pay taxes in Britain
A government fund estimates that it will raise 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamping fees when they buy real estate in Britain. The excess will be used to assist the homeless. Theresa May will report this today.
The operation will be regarded as an attempt to undo the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters by promising housing for the available price and taxing higher - rankings.
Individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in Britain have to pay higher stamp fees, and the excess will take action by the government to assist the homeless.
The increase - additional to current stamping fees, including the increase that was made two years ago in an additional home and real estate purchase for rent - could be up to three percent.
Government funds estimate that the increase will produce up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of new London buildings are purchased by foreign partners, which increases prices and makes property purchases for the first time harder to enter the market.
Many rich areas in the country — especially in the capital city — have become “dream towns ” because of the number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamping fees to help other young people to have their first home.
He accused a large construction company of keeping property prices high by buying land but not using it, and urged May to withdraw from the homes at a manageable price to fix the “household ” Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a number of significant renovations in housing, including the lease terms and the end-of-day outsources from the flat.
He also wants to give more authority to build a new home.
Theresa May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate myself to the restoration of the British dream in my first period of time — that each new generation should enjoy a better quality of life.
And that includes fixing our useless real estate market.
The door of Britain will always open to those who want to live here, work and build up their lives.
However, it may not be right for foreign parties to be as easy as for companies with foreign headquarters to buy a home and suitable for British nationals.
For many, the dream of their own dwelling is far too far, and the shame of homelessness is still too real."
Jack Ross: 'My main goal is to train Scotland'.
Jack Ross, coach of Sunderland, says that it is his “most important goal ” to become a coach of Scotland at one time.
This 42-year-old Scotsman is now taking advantage of the challenge of blowing new life at the North-East Club, which is now in third place in the first division, three points from the top.
He moved to Sunderland in the summer after returning to the Scottish high school in the last season.
“ I wanted to play for my people as a player.
I was injured on my knee and so it was over," said Ross in an interview with the BBC Scotland Sports Sound.
“ But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father, as a child, and it’s always something that has pulled me back.
But that's only a chance if I'm doing a good job of training the department."
The predecessors of Ross as trainers of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of the Alloa Athletic Club said there was no fear of following in such a famous name by such a big club, but he had previously rejected training positions at Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“ Like this, I will measure my success by thinking, ‘ Can I get this club back to the prime? ’
He said, "This club is definitely home in the prime department because of its structure and situation."
“It’s not an easy task to get him there, but I would probably only look at me as a success here if I came the club back up there. ”
Ross has only three years of experience as a coach after a period of training as assistant coach for Dumbarton and 15 months as part of a coach for Hearts.
He helped Alloa recover from falling down to the third division, and changed St Mirren, who was about to fall for division, into the next season of the department.
Ross claims to be more confident now than he ever was at his acting career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real time meeting," he said about the period when he became Coach Alloa.
“ I really believed that my training was even more convenient to me than playing.
It sounds strange, because I was doing well, I had a decent income from it, and enjoyed a reasonable success.
But changes can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot of things every week.
I am still going through it with stress and pressure from my work, but the training work seems simply right for me.
I always wanted to train, and now I do, I've never felt better about myself in all my adult years."

The best time for beer is at 5:30 on Saturdays, according to a poll
The summer heat wave has proved to be beneficial for a British bar that has a bass, but it has increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
The sale at pubs and bars increased by 2.7 per cent in July, but sales at restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent, according to figures.
Peter Martin, from CGA’s business advisory firm, who collected the figures, said: “The continued sunshine and unexpected success of England in the world cup meant that July followed a similar pattern and June, when a battle increased by 2.8 percent, except for what a restaurant sold even less.
Salan fell by 1.8 percent at restaurants in June and again worsened in July.
Pussies and bars, which mainly refer to the sale of beverages, were the best for a larger upturn during the downturn of restaurants.
Puppies who sold food also had problems in the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to go out to drink.
Drinks should be marketed in pods and containers increased by 6.6 per cent a month, but food sales decreased by three per cent."
Paul Newman, from the RSM reporting firm, said: “These results remain on the curve we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social events or sporting events are still the biggest factors in the retailing of markets outside the home.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups are still experiencing difficulties, even though sales reductions of 4.8 percent between months are particularly painful on top of continued cost pressure.
This long and hot summer could hardly come at a worse time before the grocery store and only time will tell whether to temper the temperature, as we have had in August, will improve the condition."
The total sales volume in the pubs and restaurants, including those in newly opened places, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting how the openings were possible.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the monitoring company with sales in the British pub- bar- and restaurant store, collects and reports data from 47 operational groups, with a combined range of 9 billion pounds and is the industry standard for the sector.
One out of every five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents
One out of every five children, up to 11 years old, have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 students showed an increase in 'genuine Insta' pages
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual material
Twenty percent of students claim to have a "primary" account they show parents
One out of every five children, up to 11 years old, make secret accounts on social media that they keep secret to adults.
A survey of 20,000 students showed a large increase in the 'real Insta' accounts - which is a reference to the Instagram website.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual material.
Twenty percent of students said that they had a clean “primary ” account to show parents, as well as keeping secret bills.
One mother, who fell down on her secret website at the age of 13, found a teenager who urged others to “encourage me. ”
The study conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Congress of the Private School Manager (HMC) showed that 40 percent of children 11-18 years of age had two accounts, and half of them admitted to having a secret bill.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of HMC, said: “It is a concern that so many youths are tempted to create an area on the Internet where parents and teachers cannot find them. ”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "red athletes" of the Scottish Athletics Sports Committee
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as executive without executive authority at the annual general meeting of the government.
Doyle is the most successful freelance woman in Scotland and Ian Beattie, chairman of the committee, said that the appointment was a great opportunity for those who led the sport to benefit from her great experience in the international field in the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect within a sports community in Scotland, Britain and internationally, and we are sure that sports in Scotland would make a lot of money to get it to the committee, ” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am very interested in speaking on behalf of athletes and hope that I can do my part and help to continue my sport in Scotland. ”
The U.S.A., who won among the 400 - foot [200 m] and 400 - foot [400 m] races at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, but a total of four Olympic gold, now enjoying a regular visit to the BBC, was paralysed after a transient ischaemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “One month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time would tell if I was okay and how much.
It's been a hard job, but I got used to it, learned to walk again, and did sports today!
Thank you for your encouragement!"
The breast pump lighting, which compares mothers to cows, causes network differences
Enterprises producing breast pump are now listed on the Internet for advertising to lactating mothers in lactating cows.
The company Elvie published an ad to highlight what is said to be “the world’s first portable breast pump. ” The ad is inspired by music videos and should show the freedom that the new pump gives mothers who are breast - feeding.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cum with songs such as, "Yes, I'm milking, but you don't see any tails on me" and, "If you didn't notice it, it's not a mound, it's my chest."
The supplement continues: “Pump, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, I pump milk from the July. ”
However, the advertisement, which appears on the company’s Facebook page, has caused publicity on the Internet.
With 77,000 viewers and hundreds of comments, the video has received varying reactions from spectators, many of whom say that it was “the horror ” of the dairy industry.
“A really bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Just as we do, they have to become calves and bear to produce milk, except what the calves are taken from them only a few days after they are born," said one of the speeches.
The Elvie breast pump fits comfortably in the infantry holder (Elvie/Mother)
Another audience wrote: “Really difficult for both mother and child.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another added: “This advertisement is totally out of date. ”
Others came to the defense of the advertisement, and one woman admitted that it would be “disciplined. ”
“ I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would have bought this if I still had a baby.
I felt exactly like a cow when I was pumping milk out of me.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took her the way she is.
It's a genius," wrote one of the audience.
Another said: “This is a fun advertisement, which is directed to mothers who pump milk (often at work or inside a toilet) and feels like “coum. ”
This is not an advertisement that commends or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the advertisement, the women’s group shows that they were all dancing with the breast pumps hidden in their breasts.
The idea behind the advertising campaign is based on the fact that many women say they feel like cows when they pump milk out of them.
The Elvie pump, however, is completely quiet, has no wires or wires, and fits comfortably into the chest holders, which give women the freedom to move, hold their child, and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, a partner and boss at Mother, said: “The Elvie pump is so revolutionary that it deserved a prominent presentation that would give a talk.
By likening women, we wanted to focus the spotlight on breast - pumping and all of her challenges, even showing in a fun and familiar way how much freedom the new pump would provide.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has been reported.
In London’s fashion week, a two - childed mother was presented at a fashion show to the designer Martha Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children moved quietly to camp at the Texas border
The number of immigrant children in custody has increased suddenly, even though the number of people crossing the border each month has remained somewhat the same, for the reason that hard words and policies put forward by Trump’s government have made it harder for children to be temporarily placed on the market.
Usually, the foster parents have been unregistered immigrants themselves, and they have feared that they might continue to be at risk in the country by offering to foster a baby.
The risk was increased in June, when the government announced that potential foster parents and other adults in the home had to provide fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the immigration authority.
Last week Matthew Albence, the head of immigration and customs, witnessed before the Senate and said that his institution had arrested a number of people who wanted to feed single children.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested were not on a criminal record.
“ Nearly 80 percent of those who are either foster parents or in the home of foster children are illegal in the country, and a large part of them are illegal immigrants on a criminal record.
'That's why we keep looking for them,' said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to speed up the handling of the children’s affairs, representatives reported on new rules requiring some of the children to appear in a courtroom within a month of their imprisonment, rather than after 60 days, which was former standards, according to those working in the field.
Many of them will face a video meeting, rather than a personal meeting, to argue for their legal position before judges in immigration matters.
Children who are judged unfit for entry into the country are quickly sent out of the country.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent or fugitive attempts, according to the workers of the shelters and reports published by the system in recent months.
Speakers said that these problems were even more likely to occur in a larger institution, such as Tornillo, where no one is likely to notice that a child is difficult because of the number of them.
They added that the transportation of children to the camp city without sufficient time to prepare them for spiritual or greeting friends could add to the shock that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria says the US, France and Turkey “retires” immediately
Mr. Walid al-Moualem, Foreign Minister, also said in his speech at the General Assembly that Syrian refugees should return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also plays the role of Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign army was illegal in Syria, under the false condition of fighting terrorism, and that “they will be treated accordingly. ”
“They have to withdraw immediately and without any conditions,” he said to the Senate.
Moualem firmly stated that “the war against terrorism was almost over ” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have had to flee from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue “to wage this sacred struggle until we clear all Syrian territory ” of both terrorist groups and“ all illegal foreign parties. ”
The United States has about 2000 soldiers in Syria, where most of them train and advise both Kurdish troops and Syrian Arabs who are fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in this war - torn country.
In the case of refugees, Moualem said that circumstances were good enough for them to return and taught “some Western countries ” to spread“ reasonless fear ” that encouraged refugees to stay away.
“We have called on international society and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return, ” he said.
“They make politics out of something that should be purely human. ”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide any funding for reconstruction in Syria unless there is a political agreement between Assad and the resistance to end the war.
Erindrekar S.D. says that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a neutral area at the last major battlefield created the opportunity to continue political conversation.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a great deal of attacks from being waged by the Syrian troops of Russia, in the region where three million people live.
Moualem, on the other hand, stressed that the agreement had a 'significant deadline' and expressed the hope that military operations would be directed towards the jihadists, including the Nusra Front fighters, associated with Al-Qaeda, and that they would be 'annihilated'.
Staffan de Mistura, Ambassador S.D., hopes to be able to attend the first meetings with a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition, to prepare a postwar regime for Syria and to pay the street for elections.
Moualem put forward conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that her work should be limited to “overcoming the current government’s rules, ” warning all interventions.
Reasons for Trump to win another election period
According to that reasoning, Mr. Trump would win the awards in 2020, unless the charges and scandals put an end to his presidential career, as many liberals probably hope.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic end of Presidentialism ever! ”
At present, the audience has no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the best-time perspective has doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and nearly triples to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers at the best time, which is an increase from 1.7 million spectators four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the share of MSNBC, The Rachel Maddow Show, has peaked with up to 3.5 million viewers on important news events.
"This is a fire that people are attracted to, because this is something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, director of ABC's dramatist "Designated Survivor" about a government employee who will be president after the House of Commons is destroyed.
Nell Scovell, an experienced columnist and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys ” Club, has a different rendering.
She remembers going in a taxi in Boston for the 2016 election.
The cab driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why?
"He said, "Because he makes me laugh," said Miss Scovell to me.
There's an entertainment value in the mess.
Unlike TV, however, stories from Washington may determine the fate of Roe v. Wade, whether the families of immigrants can join together and the health of the international economy.
Only those who enjoy the greatest privilege can afford to stop watching.
And yet this is more than being an enlightened citizen when you look at a group of experts in the sixth hour using Bob Woodwards on the “very close” sources for his book “Fear,” or a $15,000 jacket made of ostrich leather that Paul Manafort wore (“a garment born with pride,” said Washington Post) and the consequences of accurate biological descriptions of Stormy Daniels on Mr Trump.
At least I'll never look Super Mario the same way again.
"The end of what he does to make you feel like a reality factor is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the author of the "Pawn Stars", discussing the work force in Trump's exhibition and the daily changes in the narratives (e.g. starting a fight with N.F.L. and commending Kim Jong-Un).
You can't miss one factor, or you'll lose your heart.
When I got in touch with Mr. Fleiss, there were 26 degrees of heat and sunlight outside his home on the northern shore of Kauai, but he stayed inside and looked at MSNB while he took up the CNN.
He could not break away, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to testify before the Senate Judicial Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we were creating all these crazy things in the old days, and people said, “This is the beginning of the end of Western civilizations,” said Mr. Fleiss to me.
“ I thought it was some sort of joke, but it turned out people were right. ”

Outflows in the Nearest Elections of the Middle Period
It is not surprising that the 17th run of Pennsylvania will see the money flowing to it, thanks to the reorganization of territories that resulted in two representatives competing for the same seat.
The newly reorganized Pittsburg area will present the democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another selection area in special elections last summer.
Lamb invites himself against other representatives, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is now a representative of the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is very close to the new 17th district.
The maps of the chosen areas were reorganized after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old territories were organized for the sake of the Republics and that they violate the Constitution.
The race in the new 17th electoral area has been launched to compete in campaign funding between the main investors of both classes, the Democratic Committee on Elections (DCCC) and the Committee on Elections (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a short victory in a special election in March before the 18th elections in Pennsylvania, many of whom followed.
The Republicans had previously heated it down for more than a decade, and Donald Trump, President of the Electoral Region, won a 20 - degree victory.
Political experts have given a little advantage to democrats.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for support of China, but then they stopped.
In fact, the Dominican Republic and Panama had already admitted Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Juan Carlos Varela, president of Panama in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the co-owners ran away the management team of the Trump corporation.
Representatives of the U.S. Department decided to call back the U.S. ambassador in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama for “new decisions to accept Teavan no longer, ” said Heather Nauert, the council’s spokesman in an early statement.
However, sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received USD 140 million from the United States for relief work in 2017, including for drug monitoring, development work and economic support.
The penalties imposed, including a reduction in financial support and restrictions on residence permits, would have been painful for the Central American country, where unemployment is high and the rate of murder is high.
As internal meetings continued, the United States and Central American representatives postponed the Security and Economic Progress Conference and were scheduled to follow a similar meeting that was held in the past and was considered to be a step forward in efforts to prevent people from moving to the United States.
By mid - September, however, representatives from the upper ranks made it clear that they wanted the convention to take place, and as a result, they ended all mischief in punishment against El Salvador.
Vice - President Mike Pence is now to address the conference, which will be held in the middle of October, as a symbol of the importance it attaches to the government, said the congregators.
The three U.S. ambassadors also quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, with no new heavy messages or punishments from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton refused to discuss in detail the discussions described by the three American representatives, including two errands, who agreed to discuss the preliminary discussions against being anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outsider who works closely with the government and also spoke about the matter against anonymity.
Learn the History
The next scandal could be the report by Robert Mueller, a special prosecutor, of possible actions by Mr. Trump to prevent justice, but before that accusation there are numerous official evidence.
It is also said that Mr. Mueller also pointed out whether Mr. Trump’s campaign had worked with Russia in its attack on our election.
If the Senate is controlled by another group, Trump may have to bear responsibility for it, at the time he prepares to meet his electors again, and perhaps his fellow equals.
However, this is very unwise and I do not want to insist that Trump's fall is clear, nor does his colleague in Europe fall.
We all have to choose, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the battle will be.
In 1938, German authorities were ready to rob Hitler of power, only if Western countries had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovak people in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the calamities that followed.
History revolves around such important points and speeds up or slows down the unstoppable process of democracy.
The United States is now faced with such an important sentence.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires District Attorney Rod Rosenstein, the man in charge of the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a bad position since this magazine reported that last year he had proposed to make secret recordings of the president and discussed whether he was unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is wrong.
“How will we react if the new investigation by the FBI at Brett Kavanaugh is not detailed or reasonable, or if it is confirmed in the seat of the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote for Congress in the mid-term that will allow Mr. Trump to assume responsibility?
If we fall on these tests, democracy will have to endure a long winter.
But I don't think we're going to fall, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother, a Jew from Czechoslovakia, was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime and was formerly assigned to my missionary home.
She survived, moved to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the table with the crosshairs.
With such an inheritance, how can I look beyond our positive eyes to the future?"

Graham Dorrans, Rangers teammate, optimistic for the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory against the Austrians will take them to a strong position to get out of the European Union's G-group. Rangers made a great match in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month.
A knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from playing his first game at the time before the game against Villareal, which ended with a 2-2 draw, but he believes that Rangers can use it as a jumpboard for better results.
“It was good to get this point for us, because Villarreal is a strong team,” Dorrans, 31 years old.
“ We started the game with the belief that we could reach something and end up taking one step.
Perhaps we could have claimed victory at the end, but overall, a fair result was probably a fair one.
They were probably better in the first half of the game, and we got into the second half of the game and played better.
Thursday is another important night for the European Union.
I hope we can reach three points, but it's going to be a tough game, because they did well last time, but with the audience who supports us, I'm sure we're going to endure this and get a positive result.
Last year was difficult, both because of my injuries and the changes that happened in the club itself, but now there is a good feeling about the place.
The team's good and the boys are enjoying themselves. The training is good.
I hope we can go further now, put the last season behind us and succeed."
Women lose sleep because of the fear of losing retirement savings
Even though participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few discussed it with their family members.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide survey said that they discussed the cost of long - term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children.
“People want family members to do it, but it doesn’t take the right step to have those conversations,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationalwide’s Life Insurance Department.
That's how to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for caring for them if you do not make your wishes lightly.
Talk to your counselor and your family about where and when you receive care, as these options can change greatly in terms of expenses.
Include your financial adviser: Your counselor can also help you find a way to pay for this cost.
Among the options you have to pay for long-term care are long-term insurance, mixed life insurance that pays off in cash, to help pay the cost, or self-assurance with your own money--for as long as you have it.
Prepare all legal documents: Prevent legal conflict in advance.
Ask your healthcare provider for your care so that you can appoint someone whom you trust to care for your health care and ensure that healthcare professionals respond to your wishes if you cannot directly express them yourself.
Consider, too, obtaining a source of procuracy for your finances.
You would choose someone you trust to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that your accounts are paid if you cannot do so yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother is in an emergency and is going to a hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and hypersensitivity?
Please enter this information exactly in your written schedule so that you are ready.
“ It’s not only about finance, but also about who the doctors are, ” said Martin.
“Who are the drugs?
Who will look after the dog?
Keep that plan ready."
A man shot repeatedly with an air gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot many times with an air gun when he was on his way home on foot after having had a good time.
The victim, a man in his 50 ’ s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, the abdomen, and the hand.
Representatives describe the shooting, which took place at 2:30 a.m., as “an arbitrary attack. ”
The victim did not see his attacker.
The man was not wounded, and police have called for witnesses.
In Indonesia, earthquakes and flood waves
At least 384 people left their lives behind a powerful earthquake and a flood wave in the Indonesian city of Pala on Friday, said representatives, and it is expected that the dead will rise.
Since all communication is down, relief workers have not been able to provide any information from the Donggala County, which is the northern part of Pala, located near the center of the earthquake, 7.5 on Richter.
More than 16,000 people were left their homes in Palah after the disaster raged over.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi Region and is located at the bottom of a narrow river on the western shore of the island of Sulawesi. The estimated number of inhabitants was 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th birthday when the earthquake and the wave of the flood hit.
Donggala is a county that covers more than 300 miles [380 km] of shoreline on the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The district government had an estimated population of 2,99,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main occupations in the Central Sulawesi region, especially in the Donggala coastal area.
Nickel study is also important in the region, but most of them are in Morowali, which is on the beach in the face of Sulawesi.
River waves have blown up in Pala and Donggala several times in the past century, according to Indonesia’s disaster agency.
In 1938 more than 200 people died when a flood flood struck and hundreds of houses in Donggala were destroyed.
Also, in 1996, a flood on the western part of Donggala, where nine died.
Indonesia sits on the active continent of the Pacific, where earthquakes are regular.
Here are the main earthquakes and flood waves in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake on the western coast of Aceh in the northern part of Sumatra raged over the 26th of December and started a flood wave that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people across the shoreline of the Indian Ocean, of which more than half were in Aceh.
2005: A row of strong quakes crossed the western coast of Sumatra late in March and early in April.
Hundreds die on Nias Island, out of the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The earthquake reached 6.8 on the Richter River, crossing the southern part of Jöva, Indonesia’s most populous island, and caused a flood wave that struck the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: The earthquake reached 7.6 on the Richter River, near the city of Padang, a capital city in the western part of Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: The earthquake reached 7.5 on the Richter River, crossing one of the Mentawai islands, near Sumatra, and raised up to 300 - foot [10 m] flood waves that destroyed a number of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: The foundation of the earthquake raged over the Pidie Jaya County of Aceh and caused the destruction and persecution as people remembered the destruction of the deadly earthquakes and flood waves in 2004.
This time no Deluge was formed, but over 100 died as buildings collapsed.
2018: Large quakes roam the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, and more than 500 people died, mainly on the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings, and thousands of travelers were temporarily trapped on the island.
The eldest son of Sarah Palin arrested for charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and president of the United States, has been arrested for assault.
The 29 - year - old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspicion of domestic violence, for attempting to block the announcement of domestic violence and to resist arrest, as reported by the Alaska State Police, published on Saturday.
According to the police report, Palin picked up his friend’s phone when she tried to call the police to report a alleged crime.
Palin is held at the Mat-Sa station where he is waiting for his hearing before judgment, and he is held against a $500 bail, according to a report from KTUU.
On Saturday, when he was asked to declare guilt or innocence, the news station said that he was “not guilty, not clumsy. ”
Palin is charged with three A - class crimes, which means that he could be sentenced to prison for up to one year and had to pay $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with crimes of class B, punishable by one day in prison and $2,000 in fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been accused.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The issue is now being discussed for the Alaskan surrender court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of preventing the announcement of domestic violence, and of carrying weapons under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend has claimed that he punched her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of surrenderers after she was teaching shocking disorders about his son’s violent behavior, by his military service in Iraq.
An earthquake and a flood in Indonesia, one hundred dead.
At least 384 people died after the earthquake on Friday over the Indonesian island of Sulawes.
The earthquake of 7.5 on Richter set off a flood wave and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications systems are expected to increase in the next few days.
The earthquake got right in the middle of Sulawesi Island, which lies northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos that show when the incident occurred are now circulating on the social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered at the beach festival in the city of Palah when the wave of the flood struck the beach.
Suspects seek a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist in New York City
Prosecutors of New York want a death penalty against Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of having taken part in a terrorist attack in New York City, which killed eight people, which is a rare sentence that has not been used in the state for crimes against federal law since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is thought to have taken a Home Depot truck to hire to attack people on a bicycle along the road West Side Highway in the lower part of Manhattan. He drove down there walking and cycling pedestrians in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the victims of the eight “wilding ” victims and caused serious bodily injuries“ on purpose, ” according to the Declaration of will to execute a death penalty recorded in the New York South District Court.
Both of these defendants can lead to possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, Saipov filed an appeal against 22 members, including eight charges for murder for criminal purposes, usually used by prosecutions against organized crime agencies, and Saipov was charged with violent crime and for destroying the car.
The attack included “a remarkable planned plan” and said the accusers and described Sapiov’s actions as “abominable, cruel, and immoral.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov suffered physical injury, injury and loss for families and friends Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," said in the will statement.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the southern part of New York was the last to deal with the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but was ultimately sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last carried out in a New York court case in 1953, against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were killed after being convicted of spying on the Soviet Union in the Cold War two years earlier.
The couple were both killed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no evidence of the days and months after the attack, according to court records.
He told a detective that he was comfortable with what he had done, said a police officer.
Saipov told the authorities that he had got the idea of the attack after watching videos from ISIS on his phone, as stated in the charges.
He also asked to show the flag of ISIS in his hospital room, said a police officer.
He has declared his innocence in all 22 members of the trial.
David Patton, one of the public defenders of Saipov, said that they were “unquestionably disappointed ” by the decision of the prosecutor.
“We believe that the decision to ask for death penalty instead of accepting a life imprisonment declaration without the possibility of a probationary period will only prolong the shock due to this event for all shareholders,” said Patton.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the prosecutor not to seek the execution of the death penalty.
Congressman says that NIGEL FARAGE should conduct negotiations for Brexit.
Nigel Farage promised to “act the forces of the people ” today at protests at a conference of conservatives.
This former leader, Ukip, said that politicians would have to be “found under pressure” from skeptics about the EU, at the same time as one of Theresa May’s members suggested that he lead the negotiations with the EU.
At the protest march in Birmingham, coworker Peter Bone said that if Mr. Farage was the leader of Brexit, Britain “would be out. ”
However, the challenge facing May to settle a deep conflict between her own teammates became even more evident when other protesters against Brexit participated in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Chequers programme on track and is critical of those who are opposed to Brexit and the EU.
The Americans claimed that they will continue to fight to reach agreement with Brussels despite opposition - and force those opposed to Brexit and the Workers' Group to choose between her plans and 'disease'.
Mr. Bone said to the Leave Means Leaf protest march in Solihull that he wanted to “get rid of the Chequers plan. ”
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been involved and assume responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were with the government, we would have gone out now," he said.
The Senator from Wellingborough added: “I will support Brexit, but we must get rid of the Chequer plan. ”
He explained his opposition to the EU and said: “We were not fighting to serve others during world wars.
We want to write our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone referred to evidence that the public opinion had changed from the 2016 elections: “The idea that the British public had changed their opinion and that it wanted to stay is totally untrue. ”
Andrea Jenkens, a conservative supporter of Brexit, was also attending the protest march and told the reporters: “I just want to say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular among the public, and the opposition will not vote for it, and it enjoys unpopularity among our platooners and activists who are on the streets and choose us.
Do it, stop the Chequers plan and start listening."
In her direct messages to May, she added: “Prime Minister, when they fulfill their promises, keep the job. ”
Mr. Farage said that politicians would have to be “found under pressure ” if they were to deviate from the decision that was made following the vote in 2016.
“ This is now about trust between our people and our political group, ” he said.
"They want to try to betray Brexit and we're here together today to say to them "we won't let you get away with this."
He added in his messages to the crowd: “I want you to put pressure on your political party, which is cheating on Brexit.
We activate the army of the public in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and we will never rest until we have become independent, self-governing, proud Great Britain."
At the same time, protesters from the EU held a protest in Birmingham, which ended with a two-hour protest meeting in the city.
After the group was set up this weekend, a small group of operatives waved against Brexit.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Workers ’ Group, made a mockery of the safety problems that arose in the group’s phone program when the convention was opened.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have all the computer systems okay and all the technology for Canada plus, for borders without barriers, for free trade with Ireland without borders," he added.
“ It’s a total scandal.
There is nothing that can be called good Brexit," he said.
Warren is going to "consider seriously" to present himself to the President.
According to U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, following the November election, “there is a serious presentation to the office of President. ”
According to a report from Boston Globe, the Massachusetts democrat discussed his future at a civil meeting in the western part of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has rarely criticized Donald Trump U.S. President of the United States, invites himself to the November election against the Republican Geoff Diehl, who was in charge of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been the focal point of the grievances that she could volunteer against Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke's afternoon on Saturday was her 36th meeting in the form of a civil meeting with residents of her district, since Trump took office.
One attending the meeting asked her if she would intend to present herself to the president.
Warren said it was time for “women to go to Washington and join our government, and a woman as a leader is needed. ”
Arresting following a fatal attack on Sims from LSU
The Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced on Saturday that she had arrested one suspect in the LSU basketball player's game Wayde Sims, but he was shot to death on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police reported that Dyteon Simpson was arrested at a 20-year-old news conference at 11 a.m.
She had previously released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for assistance in identifying a person on the tape.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot to death near the University of Southern University early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims got shot in the head and died because of it," said Murphy J. Paul, police officer, at the newspaper on Saturday, according to a report from 247 sports.
Wayde came to his friend's defense and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to having been at the scene, with weapons in his course, and admitted to having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested uncomplicated and in custody at Baton Rouge's East Police Department.
Sims was two feet tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, he played 32 games, of which 10 in the starting team in the last season and played an average of 17.4 minutes, scored 5.6 points, and achieved 2.9 returns each game.
Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship after Sebastian Vettel gives him the victory seat after an order from their team.
It was clear from the beginning that Valtteri Bottas had a seat in front of Lewis Hamilton before launch on Saturday, that orders from Mercedes team would play a major part in the competition.
Bottas got a good start at the start and nearly left Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to fight his teammate.
Vettel first went to the pit and had Hamilton drive into the traffic at the end of the group, but it should have been able to determine the outcome.
The Mercedes-vehicle went into the pit one lap later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton emerged from a short battle where the driver Ferrari was forced to leave the inner side after having been at risk of being left, following defense attempts in the third turn.
The Max Verstappen started in the back of the group and was in seventh place at the end of the first ring, on his 21 - year birthday.
He then led the majority of the competition when he delayed changing tyres to try to finish quickly and move ahead with Kimi Raikkonen and reach fourth place.
He finally went to the pit in the 44th ring but could not increase the speed of the eight remaining rings, and Raikkonen took the fourth seat.
This is a difficult day, because Valtteri stood by all weekend and was a true gentleman to let me go.
The team has been great to achieve this success," said Hamilton.
It was really bad body language.
Donald Trump, U.S. president, laughed at Senator Diane Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday, claiming that she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, with an accusation against Brett Kavanaugh, appointed Supreme Court judge, on sexual assault.
The president spoke at a meeting in Western Virginia, but he did not address the witness of Ford to the Senate Committee of Elders, who said that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were “bad and cruel and untrue.”
“ The only thing that could happen and the wonderful things that have been going on in the last days of the Sanhedrin, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and bad and cruel and cruel and untrue, ” he said.
“ When you see the releases and leaks, and then you say, “Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you lick this?
Remember her answer... you lashed the document - “Oh, ha, what?
Oh, no.
I don't paint it."
Now, wait a minute.
He said, "No, we didn't do it," he copied the senator.
The letter was sent to Feinstein in July, where the charges from Ford against Kavanaugh were made, and it was leaked early in September.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't explain her story," said Feinstein to the committee, according to a report from The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it confidential, and I did as she asked me to. ”
But her denial did not seem to go well in the president, who said at the meeting on Saturday: “I tell you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't leak anything, but this was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued his defense of Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, and insisted that democrats should take advantage of their accusations.
“ They are determined to regain power, no matter what method is needed.
You see the cruelty, the evil, no matter who they hurt, who they must choose to gain power and control," said the president, according to a report from Mediaite.

A pilot is making life to ensure that hundreds of passengers on a plane escape an earthquake
A pilot in Indonesia has been hailed as a hero after he died to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers could take off completely.
More than 800 people have died, and many are missing from the fact that on Friday a great earthquake came upon Sulawes Island, and a flood wave followed.
Large aftershocks continue to plague the area, and many are trapped under ruins in the city of Palau.
The 21 - year - old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave, despite the fact that his associates had fled the control tower that moved violently at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palau.
He stayed to make sure that the Batik Air aircraft number 6321, which was on the runway when the earthquake was over, could certainly take off.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was falling.
He died later in a hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision could have saved hundreds of lives, as reported by ABC News in Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to move it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
"We are very sad to hear this," he added.
The authorities fear to speak the dead could go over a thousand, when the country’s disaster agency says that access is restricted to the towns of Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong.
“The point is that the number of people who are dead is still rising, because many bodies are still under ruins and cannot be reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Institute.
Up to six feet [6 m] high waves have caused tremendous destruction in Palu, where a mass funeral will take place on Sunday.
The military and the passenger aircraft are working to provide relief equipment and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, interviewed Sky News: “Every minute a ambulance comes with a body.
There's little clean water.
The small markets have been robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said in an interview with CNN: “The Indonesia Red Cross strives to find survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, came to Palestine on Sunday and told the army of the country: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation - related tasks.
Are you ready?" said a CNN report.
Earlier this year, the earthquakes of Lombok, Indonesia, killed over 550 people.
Air Niugini: Air Niugini is now saying it's missing after the plane crashed into the loon
The airline, which had a plane that crashed into a lounge in Micronesia, now says that one person is missing, after saying that all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini announced that from the afternoon on Saturday, it did not know about the effects of a single male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Boats in the area helped save the other passengers and the crew after the plane crashed into the water when she tried to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, representatives said that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all stable.
It is still unclear what caused the accident and what precise sequence of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said both that the plane had landed in the loon just before the runway.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane had crossed the runway too far.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the approach was extremely low.
"It was really good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others could wade the water in the middle and find emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the pilots were afraid and cried and that he had suffered minor head injuries.
The Navy of the United States said that sailors who were working late from the time of docking also helped in the rescue by using an bloated boat to carry people ashore, before the plane sank to about 20 feet [30 m] of deep water.
The Air Safety Agency's data show that 111 people have been killed in the crash of PNG-registered aircraft in the last two decades, none of which were related to Air Niugini.
An expert describes the timeline of the evening when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, prosecutors closed a case against a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, expert from the U.S. Department of Justice, was in the courtroom for hours as a specialist in information analysis.
He explained how he used cell records to collect the 29 - year - old Quinton Tellis and the 19 - year - old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several cell phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers' night of death, on the contrary of his previous statements, according to a report from The Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that his cell phone was at Chamber at the same time as he said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, a police officer went to Sanford to talk to him.
Sanford witnessed on Saturday and said that he had not been in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s car that night, Sanford said that it was “a lie, because my car was in Nashville. ”
Another disagreement was that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records showed that they had only known for one week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers died, Tellis would have deleted text messages, phone calls, and her contact details from his phone.
"He took her out of his life," said Hale.
It is estimated that the defenders will move their final address on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the matter to be settled later that same day.

Another black person?!
Nanny in New York, a couple's attorney for expulsion following a 'prejudiced' text message
Nanny, in New York City, is suing a couple for illegal abortion after she received an unexpected text message from her mother complaining that she was “another black person. ”
So the couple refuse to be prejudiced, and they liken the prosecution to “breathing. ”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed dissatisfaction when she found out that her new foster, Giselle Maurice, was black when she first came to work in 2016.
“NEEEIAIIIII OTHERS AGAINST MANNESKJA” wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in text messages.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent them twice to Miss Maurice.
After discovering their mistakes, Mr. Maurice, the former nurse, who was black, ran a “old-fashioned” Plasco-Flaxman, and said that their former nurse, who was black, had suffered badly, and that she expected to have a Filipino woman, according to a report from the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for one working day and then sent home to Uber's car.
Maurice now sues the couple and wants compensation for the removal, that a sum of $350 a day for the six - month job she had been originally hired, even though no contract was signed.
"I wanted to show them that you shouldn't do this," she said in an interview with Post on Friday and added, "I know this is a difference."
The couple have objected to their accusations that they are prejudiced, saying that it was the right thing to run Maurice because they felt that they could not trust her after insulting her.
“ My wife sent her a message that she was not going to say.
She's not prejudiced.
We're not prejudiced people," said the husband Joel Plasco to Post.
“ But who would trust their children to someone after having shown this foolishness, even though it was a surprise?
His newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco likened his application to a “trafficking,” saying that his wife had arrived seven months on the way and was in“ very difficult situations. ”
“ Are you going to attack someone in this situation?
It's not very nice," said Plasco, who works at the investment store.
The case is still in court, but the public has spoken harshly about the couple on the social media and shamed them for their behavior and reasoning.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers might find it hard to like a talking bear, says a new letter.
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, who was born shortly after the book was approved, said of the letter: “It’s hard to follow someone who reads it for the first time before she was published.
"It's very funny now that we know of the tremendous success of Paddington."
She said that her father, who worked as a BBC taker before he was inspired to write a children’s book about a small toy bear, had taken away his works with a calm positive attitude, and added that his sixty - year - old edition was “good ” after his death in the past.
As far as Paddington is concerned, which she describes as “a very important member of the family, ” she added that her father would have quietly shown pride in his final success.
"He was a very quiet man, and he didn't get used to showing off," she said.
“ But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when you have a child who does something, you are proud of it even if you have done nothing yourself.
I think he looked that way on Paddington's success.
Though Paddington was a creation and his imagination, he always gave Paddington himself the honor."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye through the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been transferred to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors did everything in their power to save her life, but without success.
"Nad called regularly and told me that the situation was very bad, that she was not expected to survive," said Ednan-Laperouse.
“ Then Nad called me and told me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given her to keep the heart beat up were gradually losing their activity and getting out of the body.
She had died shortly before, and this was the body giving up.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that this was all going on.
I couldn’t scream or scream, because I was surrounded by family and other people.
I had to control myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned his dead daughter, went on board the plane with the other passengers who knew nothing of the difficulties she had experienced.
"No one knew anything," she said.
“ I drank my head, and my tears fell all the time.
It is difficult to explain, but during the flight, I felt a great deal of sympathy for Nad.
That he would need my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women submit messages to prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women who had loved ones who committed suicide are now trying to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted messages on a bridge in Wales, with encouraging messages and phone numbers that people can call and get assistance.
Tyler, a son of Miss Davis, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I have to go every day, ” she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, lives in Lydney, and said that her son had been a successful cook with an infectious smile.
“ He was known for his smile.
Everyone said his smile could light up any room."
He stopped working before he died, for he was “sucking in a very dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s 11 - year - old brother died after taking his own life.
Ms. Davis said: “I am constantly concerned that there will be consequences. ”
Ms. Davis made the message “to let people know that you can go and talk to others, even a friend.
Don't sit down and say nothing - you need to talk to someone."
Ms. Humphreys, a friend of Miss Davies’ age, lost his spouse Mark to 15 years of age shortly after his mother died.
“ He didn’t talk about his suffering or being depressed or anything like that, ” she said.
“ A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his temper.
He was at his worst on Christmas Day, when the children opened their gifts, he didn't look them in the eye or anything."
She said that his death would be a shock to them, but that they would have to work out: “This rips a hole in the family.
It'll tear us apart.
But we must continue and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs on a thread when the FBI has its own investigation.
“I thought that if we could have something similar to what he asked for — a limited amount of time and scope — maybe we could achieve a bit of agreement, ” said Mr. Flake on Saturday and added that he feared that the committee was “driving apart ” in the middle of a conflict between the groups where everything was in the backlash.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate the case?
Their reluctance is due to the timing.
The mid - term review is in just five weeks, on November 6, and if Republicans fail, as expected, it weakens their serious efforts to get their own people elected to sit in the Supreme Court of the country.
George W. Bush has been calling Senators to encourage them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and met Ashley, his wife through him, but she was a private secretary, Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI publishes its research report?
A vote will be taken at the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are sitting at the same time.
It is not yet certain that Mr. Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes on the floor of the Senate, but it would enable the Vice - President Mike Pence to break up the legal system and confirm him as a Supreme Court judge.
Number of people fleeing North Korea “decreases” under Kim’s command
The number of those fleeing North Korea and going to South Korea has decreased from Kim Jong-un's birth to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean senator.
Park Byeong-seug, quoted data from the South-Korea Association Council and said that 1127 people had fled last year, compared with 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that a sharper border sign between North Korea and China and higher charges charged by smugglers with people were key factors.
Pyongyang has not issued any official statement.
The vast majority of those fleeing North Korea are invited to receive South Korean civil rights.
Seoul reports that more than 30,000 people from North Korea went illegally across the border from the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee to China, but it has the longest border of North Korea, and it is easier to cross them than the neutral area between North and South Korea.
China regards refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, often forcing them to return to their homeland.
Communication between North and South Korea, which is still at war, has technically improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for discussions mainly on delayed nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This was after a historic meeting in June between Donald Trump, President of the United States, and Kim Jong-un, in Singapore, where they agreed to work together in a rough manner towards a nuclear-free Korean war.
On Saturday, however, the U.S. Secretary of State of North Korea, Ri Yong Ho, taught the American commercial prayers for lack of progress since then.
“Without confidence in the United States, there is no certainty about our country’s security, and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to take one side down our nuclear weapon first,” said Ri in his speech at the United States General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "the mother-sick" and says he is incapable of performing the work of Supreme Court judge
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority at the Congress, called Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court judge, “the mother - in - law, ” and told him too frantic to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made those words fall on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“ I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had ever acted like this, she would have been called a mother’s disease,” said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied with great emotion the accusation that he had sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both youths.
In his opening talk, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and he sometimes cried out and had a cake in his throat when talking about his family and his school years.
He also publicly condemned democrats in the committee and called the accusations upon him “deployed and organized genocide ” organized by liberals who were angry at the loss of the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court, for he showed that he was partial to democrats.
"I believe that these statements and how he attacked the Clinton couple and the Democrats show that he is unfit for the job," she said.
Pelosi did not answer when she was asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh expelled from work if he is certified and if Democrats reach the majority at Congress.
“I’ll say this: if he’s not telling the Congress or the FBI the truth, he’s not only unfit to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he is now,” said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh now serves as a judge in the appeal court in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she was concerned about the possible decision of Kavanaugh against the health law enforcement of the Portable Care Act or the abortion of Roe v. Wade, where he is thought to be a conservative judge.
At the hearing, Kavanaugh wondered if he would be overreacting to certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“This is no time for the motherly, partial person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘ That’s wonderful!’ ” said Pelosi.
And women need to take advantage of it.
This is righteous speech, months, and years of fierce flow out of it, so it does not come forth without weeping.
"We cry when we get angry," said Miss Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's uncommon, but you?"
She continued, “I got a lot of help from a woman who was a manager somewhere and said that she was crying too when she was angry, but she had developed some technology so that when she got angry and cried, she said to her householder, “You think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm mad."
And then she just kept crying.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed to express anger in part because they are misunderstood in principle.
One of my clearest memories of my previous job that I had in my office with men in the majority, where I began to cry out of the rage that I couldn't express, came an older woman and took in the head trauma on me. She was a cold boss who I had always feared a little and she dragged me into the stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
They don't know you're mad.
They think that thou art sad, and rejoice that thou hast entered into thee.
Patricia Schroeder had worked with Gary Hart when he was serving as president, but she was then a senator from Colorado.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was captured with a glow of cheating on board a boat named Monkey Business (Apaspil) and withdrew his presentation, Ms. Schroeder, felt that there was no reason why she could not consider offering herself to the president.
“ This was not a well - thought - out decision, ” she laughed at me 30 years later.
“ There were already seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone gave this name, "White Snow and the Seven Dwarves."
Since the campaign had gone a long way, she was behind in terms of funding, so she promised not to go forward unless she managed to raise $2 million.
There was a lost fight.
She learned that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
“Do they think I’m going to get a discount? ” she wondered.
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not formally offer herself, she was so overcome by feelings--thank you for the people who had supported her, resentment of the system, which made it so difficult to raise money and direct her eyes to the electors instead of the representatives, and anger of the gender difference--that she burst into tears.
"It might seem that I had a nervous breakdown," said Ms. Schroeder, recalling how the media reacted.
“ Kleenex could be thought to be my sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will be written on my gravestone?
"She cried?"
The reasons why business wars between the United States and China could be good for Beijing
The first shots in the business war between the United States and China were raging, and although the war is far from over, the gap between the countries could be beneficial for Beijing for a long time, experts say.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing China’s main export goods, including solar batteries, steel, and aluminium.
This week, the highest level of inflation came with new customs duties that exceed the value of $200 billion (150 billion pounds), taxing as much as half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has answered in the same coin each time and recently imposed 5 to 10 percent customs duties on American goods at $60 billion.
China has vowed to respond to the U.S. taxation, and it is unlikely that the world’s second largest economic system will be abandoned in the near future.
To get Washington to hope, demands have to be met, but it would be too humiliating for Xi Jinping, the president of China to officially bow down from the United States.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing is right in the game, business war pressure with the United States could have a positive effect on China for a long time, reducing the mutual need for both economies.
"The fact that an expeditious political decision in Washington or Beijing could lead to the situation that leads to the economic downturn in one country is actually much more dangerous than the audience has previously admitted," said Abigail Grace, an investigator who focuses mainly on Asia at the New American Security Center.
State Secretary for Foreign Affairs said that Syria was 'ready to prepare itself' for the return of refugees
Syria claims to be ready for refugees to return to the country willingly and look for help to rebuild the country, which is now in bad condition after seven years of war.
Walid al Moualem, a foreign minister, spoke at the UN General Assembly and said that conditions in the country were improving.
“Today the conditions on earth are more stable and secure, thanks to the fight against terrorism, ” he said.
The government continues to operate in normal circumstances by building up areas destroyed by terrorists.
Everything is now ready for refugees to return willingly to the land they were forced to leave because of terrorist acts and unilateral economic decisions that opposed their daily lives and employment.
IT IS estimated that over 5.5 million Syrians fled the country from the start of the war in 2011.
Six million more people still living in the country need help.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian authorities would gladly accept assistance in rebuilding the country.
However, he stressed that they would not accept assistance dependent on conditions or assistance from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by winning the United States with the final result 16.5 against 10.5 points on the Le Golf National Field outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on a European basis and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its crown when, under the leadership of the Danish leader Thomas Bjorn, it reached the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who was in trouble most of the race, struck his initial strike into the water of the 16th hole, which is par 3, and lost his game against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shone brightly in all his games and became 1 out of 4 players to get the result 5-0-0, since the race started using its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost 5/4 against Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, but he was at the bottom of the line of the European team players.
Dustin Johnson, who is at the top of the list of the best golfers of the world, lost 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter from England who played the most possible in his last race for Ryder Cup.
The Spanish player Sergio Garcia, who has played around the Ryder Cup eight times, became the most successful European player in the 25th race.
“ I don’t cry at all, but that’s all I can do today.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing and believing in me.
I'm so happy to get the cup back.
This is about the team, and it was my pleasure to be able to help," said Emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He marched his countryman John Rahman to the torch, but he won the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in a solo game on Sunday.
“ I was incredibly proud to have won the Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching him, ” said 23 - year - old Ramm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and is now registered with 13-21-3 in the competition around Ryder Cup.
This is a strange conclusion for one of the best players in history, who has won 14 big titles and is only second in place after Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had a hard weekend finding themselves in the field, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played a good game throughout the race.
Reportedly, the United States leader Jim Fury was disappointed with his team’s performance, “I’m proud of them, they fought.
It was at some point in the morning that we put pressure on Europe.
We lost him.
I'll take it from here for Thomasi.
He's a great leader.
All 12 of his players play very well.
We'll get back together, I'll work with the PGA in the United States and call the Ryder Cup and we'll continue.
I love these 12 men and am proud to be their leader.
You have to take it from above.
They played better than we did."
