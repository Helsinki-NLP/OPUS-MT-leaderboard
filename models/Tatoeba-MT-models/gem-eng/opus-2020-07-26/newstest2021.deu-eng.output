Biker reacts with lightning speed and prevents worse
On Friday evening a traffic accident occurred on the road between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured due to his rapid reaction.
Car driver oversees biker
A 44-year-old car driver wanted to take her VW from Merklingen to the country road in 1230 towards Machtolsheim.
She oversaw the 24-year-old motorcyclist coming from the direction of Nellingen.
Hand and foot brake levers fly away from the collision
The biker still tried to avoid the car, but ran it at the rear of the vehicle.
Due to the strip operation, the hand lever and the foot brake lever were torn off on the Suzuki and the driver was no longer able to brake.
Presently, he controlled his motorcycle in the green stiffs next to the road and let it roll out there without falling into the trap.
Biker suffers leg injury
Through the collision with the car, the biker still suffered an injury at the Bee and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvest helpers infected
After a Corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in the Lower Bavaria Mamming, almost 500 people are under quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
A security service monitors the outing.
A total of 174 harvest helpers were tested positive on the Corona-Engine Sars-CoV-2 during the series investigation, as the Landratsamt Dingolfing-Landau announced on Saturday evening.
"In order to avoid further spread, we have to take this step to protect the population," explained Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Seven employees had previously been infected in the plant - this was the reason for the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable garden, which grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and red beet - but the cucumbers only for leeches.
Mamming is a rural municipality with over 3300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to keep calm: "According to our information, it is a closed circle of persons".
In the yard, infected workers were separated from non-infected employees, the grounds are now surrounded by a barrier fence.
Greens and SPD gave co-responsibility to the state government.
The two opposition fractions accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting the control of the accommodation of seasonal workers.
"This can be bitter if such local infections have to take off and regional lockdowns have to be arranged," said Jürgen Mistol, Parliamentary Director of the Greens.
This is very similar to the SPD: "After the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof-Schlaghof in mid-May, we have already called for a special control programme for farms with harvest helpers," said Florian von Brunn.
"The hygiene conditions at the workplace and living conditions must be strictly controlled from our point of view.
This has obviously not happened".
The outbreak had come with an announcement.
Aidenbachstraße Metro Station: Dangerous dispute: 19-year-olds fall into the trackbed after Schubser
In a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße U-Bahn station, a 19-year-old fell by a pusher and slipped into the trackbed.
Obersendling - On Friday, there was a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße Metro Station against 4:15 p.m.
A passerby alerted the police with several stripes.
According to the first investigation, a Municher (17) pushed a 19-year-old to the ground.
The young man slipped over the platform edge and fell into the track bed.
Persons from the 17-year-old group helped the crashed to climb out of the track.
There was no danger of a entering train.
As reported by the police, there were then again conflicts between the two people.
The 17-year-old fled the scene of the crime, but his personnel could be determined in retrospect.
He accompanied his father to the police inspection 29.
Against the 17-year-olds is diagnosed for body injury.
Report: Seehofer insists on longer storage of data
The stock data storage is currently suspended.
Federal Minister of Interior Horst Seehofer, however, calls for an extension of the storage period after a media report.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Minister of Interior Horst Seehofer (CSU) calls for an extended storage of data for the media - instead of the ten weeks planned for half a year.
As the "Picture on Sunday" reports, Seehofer Minister of Justice Christine Lambrecht (SPD) asked for a letter to amend the law quickly.
Seehofer thus intends to strengthen measures against child abuse.
He thinks it makes sense to "take urgently needed adjustments to the law now," the paper quotes from the letter.
The stock data storage is currently suspended.
A decision by the ECJ is expected.
However, Mr Seehofer wants the amendments to be applied immediately after a possible positive decision, the report goes on to say.
A spokesperson of the Ministry of Justice said that it was only possible to consider whether legal adjustments would be necessary if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the countries, had already decided to store stock data in June.
NBA: Strip club scarring clippers star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), basketball pro of the Los Angeles Clippers, is said to have left the tournament quarter in Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to the U.S. media reports, he went to the "Magic City" strip club in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who should have admitted the visit according to ESPN data, is again in isolation, is being tested daily on Covid-19.
His reason for the visit: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, "Sweet Lou", as he is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for exactly these Wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, Note R) have the best wings in the city".
NBA-Insider Shams Charania announced on Sunday at Twitter that NBA Williams has ordered a ten-day quarantine.
The clippers star thus misses the first two official games after the test game phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to play the Corona season.
At present, the best 22 teams with training games are preparing for the season finale starting at night on Friday.
Soder expresses itself after mass infection to the Corona-Location
Munich - Minister of Health Melanie Huml (CSU) announced a tea table for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has alarmed authorities and politics.
At the large vegetable farm, almost 500 harvesters from several countries are currently working, over a third have been infected with the Corona pathogen.
The farm is now under quarantine and is closed with a building fence.
No one is allowed to leave the premises, food is delivered.
The authorities now offer free Corona tests to the well-known 3300 inhabitants of the municipality.
Since the harvest workers had little contact with the local population, so far the Landrat Office assumes that the infections have not spread beyond the farm.
"Knowledge": Consciousness of the suspected arsonist of Nantes
"My client has shown himself to be cooperative," said lawyer Quentin Chabert of the newspaper.
The defender added: "He greatly regrets the actions, the confession was a liberation for him".
His mandate was "pamped by conscience and very much taken away from the extent of destruction".
In the case of a conviction, according to the prosecutors, the man threatens ten years of imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The gothic St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes had been badly damaged during a fire on Saturday of last week.
The fire had broken out in the church at three distant places.
Laboratory investigations hardened the suspicion of arson.
The suspect now in custody had been arrested just a few hours after the fire.
But he was released after one day.
The man worked as a volunteer for the diocese of Nantes and was responsible for the closing of the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no trace of a violent invasion of the church, he quickly entered the perspective of the investigators.
Discussion on abolishing the 50+1 rule
The former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended that we consider abolishing the 50+1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates completed facts," said Grindel of the "Picture on Sunday".
He stressed: "For the associations that can become dangerous at first Bavaria and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work at all: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, the debate is not about whether it is not necessary for associations that wish to break into this Phalanx to facilitate the involvement of investors".
However, he has doubts as to whether the German Football League is prepared to allow majority participation which is prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rules.
"It remains a legal risk to move investment fences around the Federalliga economic location in a European internal market," said Grindel.
The former DFB boss sees the danger that "at the end of the day attempts to achieve a more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but will not lead to any more tension in the championship".
Even equal distribution of TV money will not have a decisive effect.
"The FC Bayern makes sales of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
The differences are therefore already immense among the first three clubs alone.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million," said the 58-year-old.
With a view to the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who have noticed this mistake and have gone through the press instead of addressing me," said Grindel about the adoption of an expensive watch that had led to his resignation in April 2019.
"That has already occupied me humanly."
The gift worth about 11,000 euros had been received by a Ukrainian official.
"I have committed a compliance breach, and it was right to draw the consequences from it," said Grindel.
"With the ominous watch present, I have been completely transparent and merciless.
Many in the DFB knew about this".
He never made a "heel out of the present", the 58-year-old insured.
"That may be naïve, at any rate this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption".
"Black Lives Matter": Victims and a Death
The protests against police violence in the United States have intensified through Donald Trump's use of federal police in several cities.
On Saturday there were clashes between demonstrators and policemen in various cities.
Three people were injured in Louisville, 16 in Seattle.
In Austin, a person was killed by shots while a demonstration move just crossed a cross.
Previously, protests against racism and police violence in Portland had once again collapsed.
The security forces, including federal police officers, used tear gas during the night and violently drove demonstrators apart.
Hundreds of armed demonstrators marched through Louisville in Kentucky on Saturday and demanded that those responsible for the death of Breonna Taylor be held accountable.
The 26-year-old student had been shot in a drug raid in her home in Louisville in March.
The aim of the raid was someone else who did not live there at all, and no drugs were found.
On Saturday, when a member of a group called himself a armed alliance of black Americans gave a shot, three people were injured.
According to the NBC station, they were taken to the hospital.
None of them were in danger of life.
The police set up barricades because there were also local protests of a white militia.
At a meeting between the two groups, it did not come at the end.
In Texas Austin, a person was shot and killed in the course of a "Black Lives Matter" demonstration.
The police, according to their own information, took custody of a suspect.
She has not yet made any further details of the circumstances of the act.
Mayor Steve Adler told us, according to the New York Times, that he was, like many in the city, "unspeakable and unconvinced" because of what had happened.
On Saturday, demonstrators collided with the police in the American city of Seattle.
They were in front of a youth prison building car in Brand, the police used blending grenades and pepper spray.
According to the Seattle Times, 16 people were arrested for resistance to police or physical injury.
In the city of Oakland, California, a courthouse was set on fire.
A small group of demonstrators had opened windows, shot down fireworks and blinded police officers with lasers, the Oakland police told them on the late Saturday night (local time).
The fire could quickly be wiped out again.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver in Colorado, a car drove through a crowd that demonstrated on a highway.
As the police reported, one of the demonstrators fired a gun and at least one person was injured in the hospital.
In addition, there was also a window in a courtroom and a fire was laid, as the police reported.
Investigations have been initiated.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defiant Corona
Although the big sauce in the spa town was missing, visitors and actors enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: The Rakoczy Weekend without Rakoczy Fest.
But: Although the big party mile in the city center was missing, people's masses and program highlights such as Saale, Rakoczy Ball or Festzug, many of them were at their expense in the Corona-compliant alternative program.
"I think we've managed to spread Rakoczy-Flair," says spa director Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have taken it very well.
In principle, one returns to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, while the historical were in the focus of the festival alone.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser has been visiting Rakoczy-Fest Bad Kissingen with her husband for more than 25 years.
So also this time in the Corona year.
The couple made it comfortable at Luitpold-Casino, observed the historical while flaning and listened to the Cuban live music at the Spielbank restaurant.
"I like it so much," Konhuise says.
She doesn't miss the human masses that otherwise belong to Rakoczy.
But you miss the usual program highlights, first and foremost Saale burns on Friday evening as well as the historic celebration and the final fireworks on Sunday evening.
"That's too bad.
The weather would have been great this year," she says.
Rakoczy Reiturnier is scheduled to take place again
For the actors of the historical guests, the alternative program meant some more work.
About for Christina Gold, who takes part in the celebration in a normal year and can be seen there on the carriage of the Kurgartencafé.
This year she was traveling on Saturdays and Sundays in Kostum on foot in the city.
"It's already more strenuous, otherwise we'll have it easier," she says.
The Reiterverein had less to do, even if some riders were on their way to the park.
"We very much hope that the horse-quadrills will be held again next year," says the chairman, Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years of break in 2021, a Rakoczy Reiturnier will be held again.
28 Corona Falls in Fuenlabrada, Spain
The Spanish football player CF Fuenlabrada is increasingly deeply involved in the crisis because of a Corona outbreak.
Since the newcomer from the vicinity of Madrid despite the first Corona Falls on July 20th had flown to the city of A Coruña, a low hit follows the next one.
By Sunday 28 players or team members had been tested positively, one came to the hospital as the club announced.
Fuenlabrada from the southwestern city of Madrid has so far had the chance to reach the ascent playoffs.
Now even the descent to the B-group of the Second League threatens.
The game against Deportivo La Coruña last Monday was canceled at the last moment, the prosecutor's office determined because of a possible crime against public health, the highest sports authority CSD considering the forced departure of the club.
Players and other team members are sitting in a hotel in quarantine.
"Up to the sixth day of quarantine, they did not receive a fresh towel and no gel," wrote the sports newspaper "AS".
You can see in photos how players would have hung underwear and club clothes in their rooms for drying in the hotel after they had to wash them themselves.
The bed linen had not been changed for five days either.
Another problem was food.
Neither it was good nor sufficient, wrote "AS".
The club manager, on the other hand, told us that you are happy with the hotel.
The allegation of deliberately endangering public health was rebutted by the club’s attorney Javier Tebas Llanas.
The Spanish Primera Division's son, Javier Tebas, stressed how the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper "Marca" reported that they did not violate the Corona rules set up by the football association.
Before the departure, there had been four infected persons until July 19, but all of them were isolated and not left with them.
All players and team members had been tested again immediately before the flight to A Coruña on Monday.
When the team was already in A Coruña, there would have been a positive "five or six" team members in the Corona test.
The game was cancelled 60 minutes before the attack, said Tebas Llanas.
Police have to catch horses that have been torn out in steam.
Two animals were on the road.
The police led her back to her owner.
On Sunday morning, shortly before 6 o'clock, a passenger told two free-riding horses on the carrier between the mouth of Donnersdorf/Steinsfeld and the motorway junction Theres.
When the officials arrived, the horses were already between the porter and the village of Steamach.
After the officials were able to gain the confidence of the horses shortly before steaming, they each had a rope carried in the chariot.
Radprofi Tony Martin: Careers-Continue imaginable
Time travel specialist Tony Martin thinks about a continuation of his career.
Frankfurt/Main - The seven-time world champion Tony Martin can imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I'm just with the team about the conditions, how and in what form it could go on," said the 35-year-old of the "Frankfurter Generale Sonntagszeitung".
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered finishing his career after this year before the Corona break.
In the negotiations with his team it was also about the number of racing days, he said.
Or about other problems that would plague him as a family father, Martin said.
Earlier he had risen after a fall, and the first thought had been, "Quickly back on the wheel.
Today I think as the father of a little daughter: what would be if".
The cyclist admitted that there are many aspects with which he is increasingly struggling.
"But it was good for me to remember from the time of Corona, what I am doing at cycling and how much fun he is doing to me."
The time-travel specialist will return to the competition at the Tour de l'Ain (5 to 9 August).
Bavaria: At least four dead on Bavaria's streets on the weekend

For at least three people, the tour with the motorcycle ends deadly.
An 18-year-old pedestrian dies too.
Schönthal - In the case of accidents on Bavaria's streets several, mostly young people died on weekends.
An 18-year-old motorcycle driver was picked up on Saturday at Schönthal, Cham County Council, by a car that came to the counter-track.
Why the car got to the counter-track was at first unclear.
On Saturday, in Upper Bavaria, a 22-year-old met on his machine with a horse-drawn carriage.
According to the police, he was downhill at Beilngries.
In a left curve he jumped against the carriage.
His injuries were so severe that he died at the scene of the accident.

Kovac tests with Monaco against Frankfurt
Frankfurt/Main (dpa) - For football trainer Niko Kovac there will be a reunion with his new Club AS Monaco with Eintracht Frankfurt soon.
On August 1, 18:00, the French Master hosted the Hessen, the former club of the Croat.
For the Bundesligists it is the first and only hard test before the replay in the Europe League against the FC Basel (6 August).
Because of the Coronavirus pandemic, the encounter is conducted without viewers.
"We are especially looking forward to this game.
It's always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends," Kovac explained.
Sporty, that was an interesting test, said the 48-year-old.
Prior to his change to FC Bayern Munich, Kovac had trained the Hessen from 2016 to 2018 and led to victory in the DFB Cup.
"A high-ranking opponent like Monaco is a good test for us in terms of the game against Basel.
Like all Frankfurters, I am looking forward to seeing Niko Kovac again," said Eintracht-Trainer Adi Hütter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had begun the succession of the Croat.
In March, the Frankfurters lost the eighth-final hint against Basel in their own stadium at 0:3.
Almost 50 New infections: Landkreis Hof just past the Lockdown

All villages are under water.
The farmers have lost their crops.
Panzerna horn in National Park Dies by Erdrutsche
In the Kaziranga National Park, several of the 120 Panzerna horns died from landslides.
They are protected and valid as being at risk of extinction.
This year, the floods are particularly bad, which is a consequence of knowledge-creators in terms of climate change.
Bangladesh, according to United Nations, is one of the countries most affected by global warming.
New apartments are empty
In the village of Cox's Bazar in the south of Bangladesh, the state has built apartments for 650 by the floods displaced.
So far, only a few people have moved in.
It is difficult to bring people to Cox's Bazar.
The enthusiasm also persists in Grenezn.
Those who used to have a house, it was also so small and similar to a cottage, often do not want to spend their lives in a large housing block.
Many apartments are empty, but should - as the government wants - be taken soon by those who have lost their house through the floods.

Argentina refuses the offer of the creditors
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Buenos Aires announced on Saturday.
"It would not only be irresponsible, but also unjust," said one opinion.
"While 50 percent of the children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors".
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer sustainable under the current conditions.
Therefore, Argentina calls on its private creditors to waive part of its claims of approximately USD 66 billion (about EUR 59 billion).
If there is no agreement, the country threatens the state's affairs again.
It would be the ninth non-payment in Argentine history.
Last time, the lenders had called for higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine government maintains its last offer and is not prepared for any further concessions.
Argentina is facing a serious financial and economic crisis.
The most recent inflation rate was more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect about ten per cent of the economic power to decline.
At the end of May, Argentina had failed to meet US$503 million interest receivables and was therefore caught in a limited default in payment.
Professionally arrived - not yet private
"It runs super good" - this conclusion draws Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days in the Notariat in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: in the middle of May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will take up the succession of Lutz Feller at the Eggenfelden Notariatsstelle.
Already six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctoral lawyer took up the job, the normal daily business is long on full tours.
"I still have to arrive privately," she explains in conversation with the Rottaler Ann teller and laughs.
Of course, the short lead time had not been enough to transfer the food point from Regensburg completely to Eggenfelden, reports the native Dingolfingerin.
Currently, she and her husband, who is working as a judge at the Landgericht in Regensburg, are looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband has been able to apply for a short-term parenting period in order to ensure the care of the two daughters (31⁄2 and 11⁄2 years old).
In order not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, they sometimes also have an accommodation opportunity with their parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Growing up in the neighbouring country circle, the city of Eggenfelden has of course long been a term to her.
When visiting the local family in the past few months, she said recently: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town".
She was all the more pleased that she had made the race in the selection procedure about the free place.
In Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career, her home in Lower Bavaria also plays a central role: after the law school in Passau, she completed her reference period and the second state degree in Regensburg.
After several stations as notarassessorin, among others in Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen im Unterallgäu and Regensburg - at this time she also trained the doctorate in labour law - she entered her first position in 2012 as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau.
She moved to Regensburg in 2016.
Since then, she has taken over representation services in various notarial offices.
When the job had been advertised in Eggenfelden because of the nearby retirement of Lutz Feller, she saw the right time for full re-entry, the 39-year-old explains.
Dr. Stefanie Kramer has taken over completely the team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday delegation at the notarial station in the future, and has a commendation for the law firm's team: "It's going super good!"
The fact that she can rely on recorded processes here makes it easier for her to take care of the forthcoming relocation of the private food point.
She has already made contact with a local institution in the fields of kindergarten and cribs.
And if everything works as desired, she hopes to be able to follow her hobby here too soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging-streets of the rat valley.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15.000 viewers
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled at the start of the season in the case of a fan return.
"Due to the distance regulation which is mandatory, we are planning to have 12,000 to 15,000 viewers at present," said Carsten Cramer, Managing Director of Borussia Dortmund.
Normally, the arena in the district town at Bundesliga plays slightly more than 81,000 spectators.
In the last season's ghost games caused by the Corona pandemic, the BVB had lost about four million euros per game.
The Cramer, responsible for marketing, digitisation and internationalization, hopes that in addition to the normal audiences, some of the approximately 4000 seats can be opened in the hospitality area: "It is of course a blow to the office if these revenues completely break away".
In view of the continuing Corona crisis, all would be "well advised to take a stable length of time for the first time".
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are in short-time work alone in Germany, then the need for entertainment is limited," said Cramer.
Dortmund's marketing manager praised the BVB's pros for their salary waiver, which is intended to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, players know that their salary waiver has a different effect than if we put 100 people working in the Merchandising process on short-term work".
Little wonder: Early start to life with a few hundred grams
Harder than a packer butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The Bub is one of about 400 years old, which is taken care of annually at the children's clinic in Graz.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extreme lightweights with not even one kilogram birth weight.
They are born so small and so early that neither lungs, nor intestines, nor muscles are fully trained.
Their skin is sometimes so tender that they could damage the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and especially made for them mini winches.
But not so small that they wouldn't be by voice - "and like," Berndt Urlesberger smiles.
"Even if, of course, they don't scream as loud as big babies."
When the whiteboard becomes the stage
Despite Corona Theater in the Classroom: The Whiteboard as a stage was just before the start of the holiday, the 9th classes of the Sankt-Jakobus-Gymnasium in Abtsgmünd.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the Theater der Stadt Aalen presented the production "The Home Dress" to the students - per video.
Afterwards, the students were able to share the piece and performance with the actress and the director Winfried Tobias via Skype.
The idea for the performance format from the current Corona situation had been born.
Teacher Teresa Nar was happy about the enrichment of teaching.
Even if all the participants agreed that the direct encounter in the theatre and stage room would offer additional excitement, the theatre also sees the potential for contact in the schools.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the game," said director Winfried Tobias.
First round: The TSV 1860 would meet at Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB Cup
If the TSV in 1860 qualify for the DFB Cup, the lions meet at Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This resulted in the release on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty possible opponents in the first round of the DFB Cup stand firm.
The lions would meet in a successful qualification at Eintracht Frankfurt.
This resulted in the release on Sunday evening at the ARD sports show.
Because of the Corona pandemic the field of participants is not yet complete, the placekeepers were released.
Due to the voluntary waiver of half-final opponent FC Memmingen, the TSV 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto Cup (4th or 5th September).
There the lions meet either the Kickers of Würzburg or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
If Würzburg were to reach the finale, Sechzig would already be qualified for the first round in the DFB Cup.
Otherwise, the Giesinger would have to enforce itself in the final game against Regionalligist Aschaffenburg.
The first round of the DFB Cup will be held between 11 and 14 September and a week before the third round.

De Havilland was well known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in the South-State Department of "Wine Weaves" (1939).
Born to British parents in Tokyo, Olivia de Havilland moved to California as a grandchild.
The Austrian theatre man Max Reinhardt discovered the 19-year-old in the role of the Hermia of Shakespeare's "Summer Night Dream".
The Warner Brothers film studio signed her for seven years and brought her out big by the side of Eroll Flynn.
Eight films shot her with the heartbreaker.
In 1946 she won her first Oscar in the lead role of "To Oak His Own".
The film ran in Germany under the title "Motherheart".
Three years later the award came as the best actress in William Wyler's "The Heiress" (Die Erbin).
She was also awarded much recognition as a neurotic eccentric in "Der dark Spiegel" and "Die langengrube".
In 1952, Daphne du Maurier proposed her leading role in the filming of her novel "My Cousine Rachel".
The play has become a global success.
With her long-standing girlfriend Bette Davis she played in "Wiegenlied für eine Leiche".
From the marriage to the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946 to 1953), the son Benjamin emerged.
In Paris, de Havilland married journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had the daughter Gisèle with him.
This marriage also broke.
However, rumors of an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath have never been confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beachvolleyball: Thole/Wickler miss finale at Comeback
The second round of the World Cup Julius Thole and Clemens Wicker have missed the finals at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, they submitted their national teammates Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21) in the semi-finals.
Last time, Thole/Wickler played at the World Tour Final in Rome in September of last year.
In the final game on the Rhine, their Ehlers/flies cast a defeat against the surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde with 0:2 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German championships were played in Timmendorfer Strand at the beginning of September: Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers secured their tickets.
Kalbitz-Rauswurf from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "Feigenblatt"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is from the point of view of the FDP only a "fig leaf" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the right extremes in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD," said FDP national politician Benjamin Strasser of the news agency dpa in Berlin.
The Bundesschiedsgericht der AfD had confirmed on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of negotiation the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Executive Board had decided most frequently in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD Group in the Brandenburg Landtag.
"If the AfD were really about removing right-wing extremists consistently from their party, functionaries like Björn Höcke and his followers would have been excluded for a long time," said Strasser.
"However, there is no political will for this in the AfD, because right-wing extremism is now part of the party".
Similarly, CSU Secretary General Markus Blume said: "That Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded, says nothing and changes nothing," he said the "World on Sunday".
"It rather speaks volumes, how many frenetic supporters still have a right extreme in the middle of the AfD".
Blume expects the AfD to land below five percent in future elections.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are counted".
Kalbitz was one of the spokespersons of the now officially dissolved "wings" around the Thuringian AfD-Landes- and Group President Björn Höcke; the constitutional protection defines the string as "secured right-wing extremist pursuit".
In May, the Executive Board of the AfD had thrown Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz had not indicated an earlier membership in the now banned right-wing extremes "Heimattrauen Deutschen Jugend" (HDJ) and in the Republicans.
Kalbitz contests membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the left-wing group in the Brandenburger Landtag, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Bundesschiedsgericht did not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf only devoured chalk.
The AfD remains an extreme right party, whether with or without Kalbitz".
With this decision neither the Federal Party nor the right wing were weakened.
"The maneuver of the muskets is transparent.
One wants to avoid further observation by the constitutional protection and tries to get through under the radar," Walter said.
"The AfD will not release the spirits she called.
There's no change in a rough spot," commented Brandenburg's SPD Secretary General Erik Stohn on the decision in the case of Kalbitz.
"Here the AfD-Landesverband and the Group held to this day as their right leader".
The legal dispute over Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
On Saturday he announced that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Bundesschiffsgericht.
North Sea wind farms deliver well 21 percent more electricity
The wind turbines on the German North Sea fed electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year 11,51.
This is well 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, the network operator Tennet announced in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which do not belong to the net area of Tennet, fed in another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
The total wind current from the North and Baltic Seas is 13.73 TWh, compared to 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
This makes up almost 19 percent of the total wind current in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms provide higher production capacities
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy is due, in addition to the wind conditions, to higher production capacities, because new wind farms have been set up over the past 12 months.
If the 1270 wind turbines in the North Sea were all running at the same time with full power, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; it is 7.1 gigawatt according to Tennet.
By 2030 it will rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and the Netherlands we are investing up to 20 billion euros in the expansion of the offshore network connections," said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind farms cannot use their capacity at sea, but they reach about 40 percent.
This year's record day is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind wheels produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
Thus, almost seven million households could be supplied with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition of the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
That was almost a small anniversary celebration at 130.
Gmünder Kunstverein's birthday: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold exploded the usual setting after the Corona break.
Much more art friends than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Kunstverein, Professor Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent delivered the volume "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern Kornhausplatz.
In the north of the gallery, the club "Sandtogether" became involved.
Freital: Windbergfest for Corona cancelled
This year the Windbergfest will not take place.
The city of Freital cancelled the three-day celebration planned in September.
In other years, more than 30,000 people had visited this city festival.
"We have certainly not made this decision easy and, knowing how difficult it is economically for the parties, we hope it will be until the last minute," explained Mayor Uwe Rumberg (partyless).
"But in the end, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people."
For if tens of thousands of people had flocked to the mainland and to the main tent, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracking could not be complied with in accordance with the current Corona protection regulation.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that not much was left of a popular festival.
Moreover, the organisational and monitoring burden would increase disproportionately by a number of times.
Rumberg voted for next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100th anniversary with, among other things, the Winterbergfest from 7 to 9 May 2021 as well as the day of Saxony from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Don't beat dressage Olympic champion Werth in Achleiten
Achleiten - The six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressage tournament in the Austrian Achleiten.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg won four victories at the weekend.
After winning a Grand Prix at the start with consecration gold and Quantaz each, she was also in the Grand Prix Special on Sunday and was not to beat in the choir.
On the 15-year-old Stute Weihegold, Werth competed significantly on Abegglen against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Sunday.
On Saturday, the Germans were also on Quanta in Kür before their 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer.
Werth's winner horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The world's most successful dressage rider is to establish the ten-year stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quanta it was the first round at all.
Already at the first Achleiten tournament three weeks ago, Werth had won all four tests.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for 14 to 16 August.
Future air traffic controllers in Worms
Wormser Hochschule continues into the air: The "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" is setting up a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and started in 2021.
With the professorship there is the possibility to enable the start of the study not only in the summer but also for the winter semester.
Thus, twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, the capacities of both the university and the DFS Academies are equally exploited.
The DFS will advise the university on the establishment and appointment of the professorship.
Since 2019 represented at the university
Since the summer semester of 2019, the first students in their training for air traffic controllers at Worms University have been in the Air Traffic Management programme.
Nine students already started this year.
So far, the experience of the DFS is very positive, the services of the students are excellent.
The combination of study and pilot training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the lotsen profession.
"In these times, economic support is not easy.
However, we firmly expect air transport to recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to be able to fulfil our statutory mandate in the future, we need highly qualified staff," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman of the Managing Director of the DFS when signing the contract.
"For the DFS, the foundation professorship is a future-proofing investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, cross-cutting knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue our good cooperation with the university and at the same time underpin our attractiveness as an employer".
This also underlines Professor Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University: "The Stiftungsprofessur is an important bridge between science and business.
With it we would like to link to the existing cooperation with the DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual Bachelor's degree in Air Traffic Management".
The trust of German air traffic control was for the University of Worm's motivation and commitment to further developing its teaching and research competence in the future fields of air transport.
In use for tomorrow's air traffic controllers, the university can set special highlights and innovative priorities for its students with the first professorship for a dual course of study.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary of the Ministry of Science, Education and Culture, emphasises: "The University of Worms, with its focus on air transport, has a unique character in Rhineland-Palatinate.
The signing of the cooperation agreement today strengthens the profile of the university".
Rescue helicopters land on the A 45
The A 45 motorway was fully closed on Saturday afternoon towards Aschaffenburg, as the rescue helicopter was in operation after a traffic accident.
A 76-year-old drove with a Ford around 12.40 in the Alzenau-Mitte exit in the curve straight ahead and landed at the control board.
Due to the impact, the front airbags triggered, the driver suffered slight injuries on the face and had to be brought to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old passenger were provided by the emergency doctor and the patient flew to a hospital following the rescue helicopter.
At present, however, the police assume that there is no risk of life.
The damaged vehicle, which caused damage of about 2000 euros, had to be towed off.
Heil intends to check other industries according to meat industry
The Corona crisis brought the situation back to light in parts of the meat industry.
Law enforcement is imminent.
But are they right - and will it remain?
Federal Minister of Labour Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other sectors of the meat industry in accordance with the strict rules currently in place.
"We will look at the industry for industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," said Heil of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employers are already warning against generally restricting works contracts.
After the mass outburst of Corona at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet intends to pass a law of salvation on this Wednesday.
Large-scale slaughterhouses are no longer allowed to use foreign personnel during slaughter, cutting and meat processing.
To this end, the use of contract workers and temporary workers is to be prohibited there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer said the dpa: "Finger away from a general restriction of work contracts and employee transfer if you do not want to completely abolish the economy".
For example, works contracts were the basis for their value added to the customer for large areas of the craft, the construction industry and plant construction.
"The failures of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument".
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban works contracts everywhere in the German economy".
Work contracts would make sense.
"When an industrial company instructs a craftsman to install a safety facility, this is a very normal work contract".
The German meat industry considers a ban on works contracts and rental work to be unconstitutional in its sector alone.
It was not possible to explain why, in the future, other labour law than that of sausage should apply to the Portioning and Packaging of cheese, according to an opinion on the legislative project, as the "New Osnabrück Newspaper" (Saturday).
Thus, in the case of a ban, the consumer price would increase by 10 to 20 per cent per kilo and product.
Many Eastern European employees from contract companies worked in the industry part 16 hours a day after the results of an examination of the NRW occupational safety management.
They often didn't have a break.
Pay has been retained for protective equipment or rent.
It was also found that the situation at the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively sharp law had already entered into force for the meat industry in 2017.
But by "tricky constructions" these had been bypassed.
"Now must be thoroughly cleaned up."
The politician announced: "In the Labour Protection Act, which we intend to adopt at the end of July in the Cabinet, also measures which not only concern the meat industry - for example, higher labour protection rates or clear criteria for Community accommodation".
This draft contains amendments to the Law on the Protection of Workers' Rights in the Meat Industry and the Labour Protection Act.
Brandenburg's Minister for Consumer Protection, Ursula Nonnemacher (Green), believes that more intensive controls are needed.
"I would like us to be able to do even more controls in many areas of supervision: food control, animal welfare, everything possible, for example animal transport," said nunnemacher on Sunday at the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg aktuekt".
However, for more controls, more personnel stations are needed.
Three dead at the crash of ultra light aircraft in Germany
When an ultralight aircraft crashed into a multifamily house in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, three people died, according to police reports.
A child was easily injured.
Two more people were injured in the accident, said a spokesman from Wesel County Executive.
A parachute had been found at the scene of the accident, according to the police.
The "Rhine Post" reported that the plane had collided with a hot air balloon before the crash.
The house is a one- or two-family house.
Further details were not known at first.
Raumung von Frankfurter Opernplatz run peacefully
A week after the openings in Frankfurt, the rooming of the opera place during the night on Sunday is also peaceful.
Finally, a few dozen people stopped in the square, but left him at 1 a.m. before the start of the lock-up.
The police have been in service since the early evening with numerous officers, and there was a greater police commission throughout the city area.
For the first time this weekend, from midnight, a restraining order was passed for the opera place, on which Krawallen had arrived a week ago.
Policemen had been attacked with bottles out of the crowd of celebrations.
At least five officers were injured after police involvement, several police vehicles were damaged.
The night to Saturday was also quiet.
Car Survives: Young woman seriously injured in an accident on 83 at Hofgeismar
In the event of an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old suffered serious injuries on Sunday, around 13.25.
She was taken to the Kassel clinic.
With thermal cameras, the fire brigade was looking for possible drivers.
According to the police, the woman was on federal road 83 in the direction of her home town of Hümme on the road, when her car came off the road from previously unexplained cause and hit several times.
To save the injured, the fire brigade had to cut the roof of the car free.
Since it was unclear whether anyone was still in the vehicle, the adjacent cornfield was searched by the rotary ladder with a thermal imaging camera.
The Drohnenstaffel from Warburg, which also works with thermal cameras, was also ordered for the search for persons.
However, the workers did not find anyone between the tall corn plants.
The heavy injured was brought to the Kasseler Klinikum by the rescue truck.
Nearly 50 operations of the Hofgeismar fire brigade, Hümme and Schöneberg fire brigade were on site.
The federal road was blocked for two hours because of the accident.
Juventus Turin Master in Italy
Turin - After a redeeming goal of Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has won the Italian championship for the ninth time in a series.
The team of five-time world footballers made the total 36th scudetto of the club history perfect with a 2:0 (1.0) on Sunday night in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo met at 1:0 a.m.
With 83 points, Turin, which, without the last long wounded ex-national player Sami Khedira, did not have to displace two days before the end of the season of the series A.
The Inter Milan table range is down by seven points.
Juventus was harmless in spite of optical superiority in the first half of the time, and Ronaldo met with the last action after a free kick.
The 35-year-old, Miralem Pjanic, took advantage of the limit of the penalty area directly with a flat shot (45.+7).
Ronaldo was also involved in the 2:0 against the more offensive guests, after having shot Federico Bernardeschi (67).
This ensured the sheer, but decisive success.
The Foulelfmeter shot at the latte in the 89th minute should only have been really annoyed by Ronaldo himself, looking at the goal hunter's valuation.
"It is complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball height for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum changes very easily," said Coach Maurizio Sarri after the 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Especially the mental exhaustion of his players was great, said the Juve Coach.
Because of the defeat, the Turiners had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
Juve’s ultimate calming advantage at the top of the table was due to the weakness of the competitors.
In the eleven games before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team had only won five wins.
It is questionable whether Ronaldo will become the king of goalkeepers.
For while the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, the former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile after his three-pack at 5:1 (1:1) of Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona has already scored 34 hits on his account - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the FC Bayern's winnings.
The record in Italy is held by the current Juve-Profi Gonzalo Higuaín.
In the 2015–2016 season, the Argentinean made 36 goals for the SSC Naples.
In August, the "Old Lady" of Italian football awaits the next title opportunity.
Juventus is in the eighth-final of the Champions League, but on August 7 against Olympian Lyon, he has to make a 0:1 win-win play in order to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next round of K.o, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as an opponent.
Baden-Württemberg: More than 250 illegal car races detected
Stuttgart - In spite of sanctions and court rulings threatened by all, motorists continue to gas many illegal races on the Baden-Württemberg roads: Last year and the first four months of this year, police in the South West have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
Although comparative values do not exist for the years before, the Rassians are increasingly working for the judicial authorities: In the prosecutions between Konstanz and Mannheim, 155 investigations were conducted in 2018 for illegal races, one year later it was already 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June 151.
The race was less about organized events, as indicated by the response of the Ministry of the Interior to a request from the Landtags SPD.
In most cases, drivers would have been spontaneously opposed to each other or they would have taken the escape from the police - this too is shown as an illegal race.
At the tax, mainly German men between the ages of 18 and 60 were employed.
113 Penalties - 15 times imprisonment
Only in a small number of cases are the shavings caught and also asked to pay: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 imprisonments have been imposed.
However, there is no indication that the number of illegal car races is actually rising.
Rather, because of the tragic accidents and processes of past years, other drivers reacted more sensitively than before and showed more often, said a ministerial spokesperson.
Rasern is especially popular with the highway 8. Time and again Automobiles brake out traffic there to make room and use the free route for a race.
Last August, a dozen riders were caught near Kirchheim under Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 at Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular racetrack
On the A81, the police even registered more races than on any other highway.
With a tempo limit, it is tried to slow the shave on the particularly affected section between narrow and geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and uplifted sports and luxury cars often have Swiss distinguishing marks, because the drivers avoid racing to Germany because of the high penalties for driving too fast and driving in the neighbouring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit should not be reduced on a few lines: "With a general speed limit of 130 km/h, we would create this problem on motorways of the body," says Martin Rivoir, the traffic expert of the SPD Landtag faction.
"Raser's inhibitory threshold would be significantly higher if one were not here and there legally at 200 km/h and more on the move".
From information or image campaigns, Rivoir holds less: "He who in such a way travels over all the rules and not only puts his own life at risk, but also the lives of other road users is scarcely accessible with reason."
ADAC calls for more police intervention
However, this is not enough for the ADAC: "We assume that Raser will not be deterred from the tempo limits," says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at the ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and even harder controls on the routes concerned.
Three people died in the race nationwide since January 2019 and until April 2020, two of whom were not involved in a night crash in Stuttgart's city centre and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men were supposed to have delivered a car race there in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, rang against a garden wall and remained on the side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
21 other people were injured in the races of the last two years.
However, sharper penalties are not necessary in the opinion of Interior Minister Thomas Strobl: "Legal requirements for sanctioning illegal motor vehicles are not seen in the paper of the Ministry of the Interior."
Blue light of 23 July: thirsty burglar steals drinks from snacks
Rohrdorf: A man broke into an snack on Thursday in Rohrdorf (Kreis Calw) and stole drinks and cash.

According to the police, the burglar also used a cash register and stole cash in the low three-digit area.
The suspect is described as follows: He is about 1.75 to 1.80 meters tall and of strong stature.
In fact, he wore a black hooded sweater, black pants and bright shoes.
Further evidence is received by the police.
Ackermann sprints to win at the end of Sibiu Tour
Radprofi Pascal Ackermann won his second day victory at the end of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old platter from the Bora-hansgrohe team went through the 109-kilometre-long section with start and finish in Hermannstadt in the mass print after he had already won a stage on Saturday.
It was the season victory three and four for Ackermann.
Gregor Mühlberger, an Austrian teammate in the overall ranking of the team.
The 26-year-old had chosen the mountain-time ride for himself in the morning and thus took over the top in the class.
Only 104 riders had arrived at the end of the evening.
Not less than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit during mountain time travel.
"I'm really happy to start the new season with a victory," Ackermann explained after his success on Saturday.
"The sprint was really hectic," said the 26-year-old.
300 meters in front of the target he just put on his sprint, "and it also worked perfectly".
In accordance with the rules of the World Federation UCI, a Corona test was conducted six days before the start of the race for all race participants and their companions.
During the complete tour, drivers and supervisors were separated in isolated hygiene bubbles from the organization team and from the media.
Spectators at the start and destination were not allowed.
Leading point gave instructions for lay reanimation
Düsseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in Düsseldorf-Garath.
In a multifamily house, a child (4) was suddenly in the water when bathing.
According to the fire department, the emergency call arrived shortly before 3 p.m.
"A commanding officer immediately gave instructions for lay reanimation," said a fireman to BILD.
The incoming rescuers took the resuscitation measures a little later.
The child who lives in danger has been transported to the Uniclinic under re-animation.
Why it failed is unclear.
The police routinely took up the investigation to investigate the accident.
The fireman: "We're going out of a tragic accident in the apartment".
Nürnberg: Unapproved Tuning Meeting - Police are gripping in, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and occasionally over 1000 people participated on Saturday night in a "tuning meeting" in the parking lot of a furniture house.
The police made their announcement to monitor such events more closely.
A big Tuning meeting came on Saturday evening (25 July 2020) in Nürnberg South City.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the Central Franconian police, an increase in vehicle traffic in the area of a large parking lot in Ingolstadter Straße had been recorded by the Nuremberg Transport Police about 10:30 p.m.
As a result, the police carried out a variety of vehicle checks there.
Only recently the police had announced that they would like to step up against so-called car bags.
Illegal Tuning Meetings in Nuremberg: Only a small part from the "Scene"
At the top, the officials numbered over 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, accounting for the police.
However, only a small proportion of those present in the "Autoposer" and Tunningszene are associated with this.
Apparently, the majority of the scene in question followed the police's appeal.
On the basis of the vehicles and persons present on the spot, it was assumed that they were mostly eye-catching.
In addition, the majority of those present remained in the current rules on protection against infection, in particular the minimum distance and the wearing of a mouth-nose protection.
The control measures carried out on site were completed at about 1:00 a.m.
In total, officials in 10 vehicles noticed structural changes that the operating permit had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No Car Racing
Illegal car races did not exist.
"The police bureau will keep an eye on the situation and will continue to carry out increased control measures, including in the context of the emergence of constables," it said.
The News5 agency spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger about the involved tow company: "They have all beautiful rims, we must not scratch them," says Schrödinger.
Special tapes would be used for this.
Also, because the cars are wider, the company had to be careful not to make any damage.
"The young people should finally keep their cars intact".
Work agency figures: 900 suspect cases of abuse in short-time work
Berlin - The Bundesagentur für Arbeit (BA) reports that around 900 suspect cases are committed to abuse of the short-time working wage.
"This is extremely little for more than 880,000 companies that have indicated short-time work," said Daniel Terzenbach, Managing Director at the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung".
When at the beginning of the Corona crisis a lot of companies suddenly applied for short-time work, the BA had to react quickly.
Usually the test lasted up to three weeks.
"So much time was not available to us in this hot phase.
All the more precisely, we'll look at the final calculations.
I'm sure there'll be something else.
We are not naive and have a long breath".
Evidence of abuse often comes from the employees or trade unions concerned.
In addition, use BA analysis software to identify abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible insolvency wave in autumn.
"Will there be much more insolvency than in the previous year?
The assessments differ, but in the case of the case, we prepare and already train our staff in the employment agencies to process applications for insolvency funds".
Terzenbach said that the figures were still inconspicuous.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party dissolved in the New Garden
Potsdam - On Friday evening, about 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
At 8:48 p.m. the assembly was dissolved by the Revierfahrers of the Prussian Castles and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the foundation informed on PNN request.
The young people would then have left the park.
On Saturday night some young people would have played in the New Garden Rugby.
The meadow had been cleared by reindeer riders, said SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee on Sunday.
It always comes to illegal celebrations in the parks
In the parks of the foundation, there are always collections where the distance and hygiene rules Covid-19 bypass regulation are not complied with.
At the end of June there was a celebration with about 300 people in the Babelsberg Park, one week later about 150 people celebrated in the New Garden.
Even without the Corona regulation, the parks are closed at the time of the collapse of the darkness.
Camping on the meadows is prohibited according to park regulations, there are only a few exceptions.
The Foundation has been complaining for a long time that visitors would leave more and more garbage and destroy protected biotopes.
At the same time, illegal park parties in Berlin have reached a different dimension.
In the Hasenheide district of Neukölln, 5,000 people celebrated an illegal techno party on Sunday.
The event was dissolved by the police.
Austria: mass tests to Corona outbreak in tourist resort
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a Corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist town of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases increased to 48, as reported by the national authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still available in the evening.
Thus, many of the infected young interns are in tourism establishments, but at least one holiday guest has also been tested positively.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodations on Saturday evening.
The lock-up time was set at 23:00.
"There are cancellations and cancellations there," said the head of the Wolfgangsee Tourist Association, Hans Wiser, the dpa.
Also, guests who are alone are early departures.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist destination in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 nights last year.
In a normal season, around a third of the guests are German.
On Friday the first infections had become public.
On Saturday, the head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended the behavior of practitioners who had celebrated in several localities and who might have been infected there.
"We all liked doing this in our youth," he said to the Ö1 radio station.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The tourism association launched an information campaign to raise awareness of young employees about the dangers of Covid-19.
From Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from 15 July onwards were contacted.
The outbreak evokes memories of the Austrian ski and party resort Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a center of Corona spread throughout Europe at the beginning of the pandemic.
A total of more than 1500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
The new infections focus on Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - The English football record champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after one year of absence.
On the last day of the Premier League, the Red Devils secured the third table seat by a 2:0 (0:0) success against the direct competitor Leicester City.
The Foxes must now be satisfied with the Europe League, because FC Chelsea was still passing and qualified as a fourth for the king's class.
In the fight against the descent, Aston Villa was allowed to rejoice.
Manchester United was led by Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in the replay time, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) came to an end.
Chelsea, in the Champions League eight-final opponent of the FC Bayern, won thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4) parallel with 2:0 (2:0) against the Wolverhampton hikers.
"This means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who is also standing in the finals of the FA Cup against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea Coach.
Tottenham Hotspur also benefited from Chelsea's victory against Wolverhampton, which with a lean 1:1 (1.0) still passed the Wolves at Crystal Palace and started as a sixth in the Europe League.
Aston Villa chose Fernduell with the FC Watford and the AFC Bournemouth for himself, but had to tremble for a long time at West Ham United.
The late leadership of Jack Grealish (84th) against Andrej Jarmolenko (85th) immediately.
The 1:1 (0:0) was enough because Watford lost 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.
The club, which has had three coaches in the season, rises after five first years.
Just like Bournemouth, who couldn't save himself through a 3:1 (2:1) at FC Everton.
At the end, a point was missing.
FC Liverpool, who has been established as an English champion since the end of June, secured a record with a 3:1 (1:1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 meters are the highest value the Reds have ever achieved in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp barely missed the score record in English football with his team.
The best-brand holds Manchester City at 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle lead in the first minute Virgil van Dijk (38.), Divock Origi (59.) and Sadio Mané (89.) turned the game on Sunday for Liverpool.
"For this wonderful club it was an extraordinary season," said goalkeeper van Dijk after the game, "that should encourage us to defend the title.
It's going to be hard."
In the end, the Premier League bosses are also likely to be satisfied.
Due to the Coronavirus crisis, the football operations in England had been interrupted from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, even a premature breakdown or the completion of the remaining games on neutral ground was discussed.
In the end, however, the season could be ended without special incidents - but as in Germany without viewers in the stadiums.
Arrested and violent in demonstrations against Netanyahu
Israel’s protests against Netanyahu’s head of government are becoming increasingly fierce.
There have been violent clashes in the night.
The Israeli police took violent action on the night of Sunday in Jerusalem against participants in a demonstration against the right-wing conservative head of government Benjamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people had been arrested for attendance at unrest, police spoke to Micky Rosenfeld.
The police, among other things, used pitchers to dissolve the rally.
According to media reports on Saturday evening, around 6,000 people had gathered near Netanyahu's county seat.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's dealings with the Corona crisis.
The protesters struck drums, blew horns and called Netanyahu to resign.
There were also participants in an area demonstration who supported Netanyahu, reported the news page "ynet".
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the private villa of the head of government in the coastal town of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested after police reports near Tel Aviv because he was suspected of spraying pepper spray from a driving car on demonstrators on the roadside.
Another man was arrested after a trade fair attack on a protester in the south of the country.
The demonstrator was slightly wounded.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv there have been repeated demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The rallies accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Netanyahu was also criticized for his handling of the Corona crisis.
Among other things, he is detained for quick relaxation and a lack of preparation for a second Corona wave.
The Corona crisis has made the country's economy difficult.
The unemployment rate last stood at more than 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the Corona virus in Israel has recently risen to always new record values.
Accident at Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter force on car - nine injured - Ruhrgebiet - Bild.de
Ahlen - A ride accident called on the B58 at Ahlen nine lightly injured on Saturday afternoon.
One car driver was on his way to Beckum with her two children (3, 5).
The police said, "Perhaps she had suddenly slowed down because she wanted to turn down."
It must have been too late for the driver of a Mercedes transporter who drove behind her.
He was powerful on the back of the car.
Three passengers in the car and six in the transporter were slightly injured in the accident.
Several life cars brought them to an surrounding hospital.
North Korea locks border town to Corona case
So far, North Korea saw a "lighting success" in its own anti-corona virus defence measures.
Now, for the first time, the country is reporting a suspect case.
Because of a first official Corona case in the country, North Korea has completely shut down a large city from fear of a disaster.
Despite the strongest epidemiological defence measures in the past six months, "the evil virus could have been introduced into the country," reported the State media.
For the region around Kaesong the border town, the state of emergency had been imposed.
The Communist leadership called out the highest alarm level.
If the suspicion were confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the gunned down country.
North Korea had so far not registered a single infection according to its own data and described its defence measures as "lighting success".
The data were questioned abroad.
According to the reports, the symptoms were identified by a "outbreaker" who had illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on 19 July.
The person had settled down to South Korea three years ago and had now returned across the border.
There was no confirmation of the cross-border crossing within the four kilometres wide and, for the most part, the still-reduced military buffer zone from South Korea.
However, according to reports from the national news agency Yonhap, South Korea's military allowed the possibility of illegal crossing to North Korea as high.
There were studies of some people.
According to North Korea, on Saturday, an emergency meeting of the Politburo of the Workers' Party, chaired by Maj. Kim Jong Un, was called for.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive disaster".
Kim had already ordered on Friday as a preventive measure "to block Kaesong completely and to isolate each district and region from others," it continued.
The data subject, as well as all the people in Kaesong who had been in contact with her, had been quarantined.
Thus, the party's central military commission is to investigate the "outbreak" and the conduct of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose severe penalties.
In Kaesong some 300,000 people live according to estimates.
Stress in front of the Council meeting: City East and noise protection are still before a big summer break for discussion
"In addition to environmental topics, the members of the board will also vote on the construction plan for the large-scale urban development-East project," said it rather casually in the middle of the city press release at the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 4.30 p.m. in the Grand Hall of the Congress Centre Pforzheim.
Above all, the upgrading of the eastern city is discussed until the end.
The majority of them are scarce, most recently even in individual committees, depending on their presence.
An appeal from the economy (building, real estate, trade and IT), which emerged from the citizenship and then developed by the administration and municipal council, not to be allowed to fail now after almost ten years of preparation, project opponent Reinhard Klein criticised as "extraparliamentary opposition", "inconceivable", "spectulation", "fixion" and "conscious false statements".
"Everybody thinks it's better to know," said Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for a year as the only representative of the citizens' list of Pforzheim.
In fact, according to reading the Treaties, he is in this position: "I know what I am talking about".
The exit is cheaper than the city's technical town hall, contrary to statements by the city administration, according to grants, whose existence small is convinced to renovate for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop quite differently when one predicts in the town hall and on the side of the proponents from the economy.
The city has its own strength and not an investor: that is its plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
In essence, it also provides for the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the opening of the castle, the rental of the ex-Thal for administrative areas and a smaller-sized city-refurbishment ideally with local carriers.
Environmental themes play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
For example, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the population of Pforzheim from noise pollution caused by road traffic, including many temporary reductions.
In a press release, the current German Transport Club welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of this because they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise, according to the VCD, by neglecting the regular bus traffic with thinned paces and by little commitment to cycling.
The City Council also agrees on the participation of the City of the Energy and Climate Protection Agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
In addition, it is on the agenda of the accession of the country of Baden-Württemberg to the Climate Pact, the redefinition of parental contributions in urban day care facilities and the request for inclusion in the state of Smart City funding.
Citizens are welcome but must take care of Corona protection measures.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
Tim Zimmermann starts his premiere season in the ADAC GT Masters with almost half a year's delay on July 31st.
Before the league of super sports cars can start operating on a regular basis, the first test runs started.
For Zimmermann it was mainly about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 closer.
The Corona crisis has prevented Tim Zimmermann from taking on his first service in the new Lamborghini Huracan of Grasser Racing for a long time.
Under special hygiene conditions this was now possible.
The 23-year-old Langenargen filmed his first rounds on the Lausitz ring and got used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
"There are a few things that are different from the Porsche from the previous season," says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go differently to the curves.
But it has really been a lot of fun."
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite his only 25 years of experience in GT sport, the Dutchman has been able to help his new teammate in many things.
"I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series also brings new challenges," Zimmermann says.
"Steijn and I understand us dazzlingly and we made tremendous progress at the Lausitzring also from session to session".
Right there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also perform his first race.
From 31 July the 33 super sports cars will race through the Lausitz.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 series newcomers, knows the route.
In 2015 he was a guest in the Motodrome.
"It worked fast and I had to get used to the distance little," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafener Renngemeinschaft Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to meet optimally in order to be fast".
How fast Zimmermann is then really that turns out in two weeks.
"The teams poker in the tests of course a little," he says.
"In the end, however, we are very satisfied and looking forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring".
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a densely crowded calendar.
There are seven races until the beginning of November.
Currently it is that no viewers will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In the middle of August at the Nürburgring, ex-formel-1-pilot Niko Hülkenberg will take to the GT-Lenkrad.
British Minister of Transport of Quarantine Decision caught cold
According to press reports, the UK Government's decision to quarantine Spain holidaymakers for two weeks after their return caught the Minister of Transport of the country coldly.
Therefore Grant Shapps is currently on holiday in Spain, while his colleagues at home decided on Saturday to take the action.
Because of the ever-increasing Corona numbers in Spain, the London Cabinet deleted the country from the list of countries from which entry without quarantine is possible.
The new regulation applies from today, Sunday, so that Shapps will also have to return to quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the rule applies to those who are only on holiday on the eve of the eve, only from Saturday, 1 August, and were not introduced overnight.
Spain, by the way, has so far become one of the "safe countries" for which no quarantine is required in Austria.
"Numerous ministers should have known in advance that there is the possibility of a quarantine for holidaymakers Spain," said Labour member Diane Abbot.
"But apparently no one has made the effort of telling Grant Shapp's message."
Nearly one month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the expiry of the strict curfew, the infection numbers in the country are rising again.
Virologists are mainly responsible for the nightlife for the recent spread.
Spain is one of the most popular countries in Britain.
From unnecessary trips to the Spanish mainland, the British Government is currently consulting, with the exception of the Canary and Balearic Islands, which are particularly popular in British holidaymakers.
So far, more than 272,000 infections with the novel Coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths have been registered in Spain.
Russia: Marine Day: Putin Announces Weapons of Hypersonics for Warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced to the Navy’s day in his country an equipment of warships with the most modern hypersonic weapons.
With these weapons, unique in the world, the fighting possibilities of the Russian sea forces would be expanded, Putin said on Sunday in St. Petersburg at the Central Marine Park.
According to the Interfax Agency, the Ministry of Defence also informed about successful tests of the hypersonic rocket Zircon built for the Marine.
The hypersonic weapons exhibit a multiple of the sound speed of about 343 meters per second.
They are considered weapons of the future.
Underwater tropicalo is being built further
It was also built on the nuclearly fitable underwater torpedo Poseidon, it was called.
The planned sea drone is planned to destroy coastal targets.
The president, who himself used a military boat, said that this year alone, 40 new ships would be deployed by the individual fleet associations of the largest country on earth.
Russia has such a vast coastal area as no other country in the world.
For 300 years, the Navy has been protecting Russia reliably, said Putin on the day celebrated by sailors across the country.
Even on many other Russian coasts, the sea forces began the sea day with parades.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside the power of Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated at a gun show in the Mediterranean port of Tartus strength.
Munitions were also fired there.
In a video published by the Ministry of Defense not only were warships, including a submarine, but also combat helicopters and jets.
Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: Help for Corona is difficult
Washington - The first hurricane of this year's season across the Atlantic has landed in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and heavy rains now threatened parts of the U.S. state, announced the National Hurricane Center of the US Air Warrior NOAA at night on Sunday (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott called out to the rescue for many districts.
The Corona pandemic grazing in Texas made the work of the helpers difficult, Abbott continued to say according to the US media.
Evacuated to be cautious
"Every hurricane is a huge challenge," said Abbott, according to the newspaper "Houston Chronicle".
Looking at the cyclone in Texas, he added: "This challenge is complicated and is even exacerbated, considering that it is sweeping through an area that is the most affected by the Covid-19 area of the state".
According to Johns-Hopkins University, as a result of the Corona pandemic, around 5,000 people have died alone in Texas.
Abbott called people who had to leave their homes to be careful.
They should not ignore "the practices we used to", such as wearing masks, said the Governor according to the CBS transmitter.
It was important that all distances were kept.
Therefore, hotel rooms were also provided in some places.
In addition, emergency accommodation should be tested on Corona.
First, damage had only been reported from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm Warning Revoked
At wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, "Hanna" was hit on the island of Padre Island just off the Texan coast on land, according to authorities.
The tropical storm had previously been raised to the hurricane of the lowest level.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm flood warning had first been issued and later taken back.
The authorities expected a weakening while "Hanna" continued to move into the interior of the country and to the northeast of Mexico.
"Douglas" moves on Hawaii to
In the Pacific, Hurricane "Douglas" was on the road on Sunday with wind speeds of around 150 kilometers per hour towards Hawaii.
The Hurricane Center, however, expected it to weaken further.
The prediction is that he will be on Sunday (local time) near the largest islands of Hawaii - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
Over the Atlantic this year, after a May forecast, NOAA expected an above-averagely active hurricane season.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes are expected, of which up to six could become very strong hurricanes, the authority had declared.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year across the Atlantic, three of which develop into storms of great strength.
In view of available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season was only 30 percent, which one below average was even at ten percent, it was then called.
US President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that his government closely watched the storms and was in contact with the states concerned.
Four goals aberkannt: Video assistant "punished" Sassuolo
Sassuolos Filip Djuricic were awarded two goals
Naples - Four goals scored, four goals won: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a rough evening at the 0:2 (0:1) at the SSC Naples in the Italian football league Serie A - and was really angry at the video assistant of the referee.
"A festival not given gates for Sassuolo.
Never before has the VAR been so hard on a team," commented the "Corriere dello Sport".
Host Naples was led by a gate of Elseid Hisaj, an outside defender, in the 8th minute, in which Filip Djuric initially cheered the compensation.
The Video Assistant Reference (VAR) took the hit back because of an abstinence position.
Five minutes later, Djuricic shot the ball into the net again - again the VAR entered.
Also the gates of attackers Francesco Caputo (50.) and Domenico Berardi (61.) took the referee team back after mentioning the VAR.
In the aftermath, Allan perfected the 2:0 end for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo.
"The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the street and punishes Sassuolo like no team before.
The new technology provides records", writes the "Gazzetta dello Sport".
FC Bayern München: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start to the hot preparatory phase for the Champions League began for Double Winner FC Bayern with a setback.
After a short vacation and a few days of training, Hansi Flick recovered well, he must already consider how he can rebuild his successful defenses after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who was behind Captain Manuel Neuer and Central Field Chief Joshua Kimmich, had the third-highest minutes of deployment, suffered a injury to the left footroot and threatened to be missing in decisive royal-class duels.
In the Muddelwetter in Munich, the Right Defender broke off a training game and was driven with a golf card from the square.
How long the unrestricted regular player has to pause in the fight for the title is open.
A match against the FC Chelsea on August 8 is likely to be difficult, with the final tournament starting in Lisbon on August 12th, the 24-year-old.
However, Bavaria does not want to be stopped by the bad luck from training on Sunday.
In his personal triple formula, Flick named the three attributes that he wants to see from his stars on his way to Portugal's capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration should show his victorious collectors in the 28 days to the end of the king's class on August 23rd.
"We have just mastered the duties with mastery and trophy.
Now it's time to make the special one," said Flick.
Until the Munichers can specifically deal with the final tournament and before a training camp at the Algarve, the eighth-final plough against the FC Chelsea is at issue for the first time.
After the 3:0 in the playoff before the Corona break, the Londoners in the domestic arena should not become the Bavarian nightmare again as in the lost "Final dahoam" in 2012.
"We have to go through the door for the first time.
We want to win, create good conditions and trust with a good game," demanded Flick.
A vote test will be held on Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn his stars, who had 13 days of vacation after the double, to a one-off August.
He welcomed 31 players on the Zäbener Straße, including the new players for the noble purchase of Leroy Sané, who met all the new colleagues on the square for the first time after his change from Manchester City.
"Leroy has put himself in good shape like all the new ones," said Flick.
But instead of talking about the new season, if Sané & Co. can no longer only train, Flick preferred to talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of single and small group training, the Londoners will now be trained in team strength, which are in contrast to the flick ensemble in the play rhythm.
After that, the Munichers could face a quarter-final against the FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi; in the semi-finals, real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are possible opponents.
A way to the finale in Lisbon "is not quite easy," stressed the chief coach, who can rely from Tuesday on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training.
The Klose and Flick World Championship Recorder knows about so many joint tournament preparation, which is especially important in the 0-on-100 tuning.
With his current team, the work was "a pleasure", she praised.
"The focus on winning" was an impressive feature of his team.
At the tournament with Neuner teams, it also went ambitious on Sunday.
Of the service providers were all involved, including the emigrational Thiago and defender David Alaba, whose stay is not guaranteed beyond the king-class season.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to vote for its world champion
Since the required number of continents cannot be driven, the FIA must improvise in order to award the World Cup title.
All America races were cancelled.
Race calendar is getting more and more concrete
The race calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
Three more races were added to the ten confirmed Grand Prix during the week.
In October the Nürburgring in Germany and in Portimão in Portugal is to be driven.
On the first of November Lewis Hamilton and Co. are fighting for World Cup points on the Italian traditional route in Imola.
The 2020 race calendar thus includes 13 races according to the current state.
"We are pleased that we continue to make great progress in completing our 2020 plans," said Formula 1 Boss Chase Carey.
In total, 15 to 18 races will be held in the king class of motorsport in this exceptional season.
Formula 1 wants to finish its season in Asia.
The final race calendar will be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
According to media reports, media performances in Vietnam and Malaysia could take place at the end of November before the already officially targeted race in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December.
Rules of Procedure requires racing on three continents
The rules of Formula 1 require at least three continents for the award of the World Championships.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents will be driven, there should be a world champion.
With the help of a special rule, the FIA intends to award the titles under "extraordinary circumstances" because of the Coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be cancelled in the short term due to the start-up Corona crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not a topic.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Absage goes to Brazil for criticism
Due to the tense Corona situation, the races will not take place in Canada, the United States, Mexico and Brazil.
"We look forward to being with them again next season," said Carey.
The rejection of the America races was particularly critical in Brazil: "The rejection did not come as a surprise to us, but we cannot accept the reasons for it," said Tamas Rohonyi, Promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
Thus, infection figures in the São Paulo region were significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
Moreover, the concerns of some teams not to travel in Brazil would not justify rejection.
They were prepared for the security measures required.
Greta Thunberg: Evil look against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her encounter with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest at Stephen Colbert's famous Lamentight show via video switch and told in an interview what she had in mind during her encounter with Donald Trump.
Klimatkivistin Greta Thunberg was a guest by video switch in a popular US Saturday show.
Among other things, she told of her struggle against the mighty of the world.
The teenage girl also spoke about her famous "bad look" during her encounter with Donald Trump.
New York City - For the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has been paying attention to herself with her tireless commitment to the Fridays For Future movement.
Now she talked about her plans in the future in a well-known Lamentight show and her encounter with US President Donald Trump at the UN Climate Summit last year.
Lamentight moderator Stephen Colbert welcomed the 17-year-old Thunberg on Tuesday in your show and conducted a longer interview with the Swedes.
She talked not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world's powerful.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to divert the focus from the climate crisis," she shook.
"Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats, just because a group of children is going on the streets," she experienced.
Head of State and leading politicians who ridicule them in social media or even try to silence them find them "successful" because they show the reactions "because they have no other answer to it".
It was particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a famous scene in which she threw a bitter look behind US President Trump.
At the 2019 UN climate summit in New York, for which the actress sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive view was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip created a GIF, i.e. an animated image that ultimately became one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the US President at that moment?
To Stephen Colbert's relatively open question, she answered briefly and dryly: "To be honest, I don't think that needs any further explanation."
With the turnkey response, the experienced Satiriker Colbert had probably not expected and disappeared laughing from the picture.
With her "How are you?" talk about the principles of climate protection, she kept many in mind at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmunder Immobilie with triple pack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobile is now located in the race around Europe's Golden Shoe on the same footing as Bavaria's Robert Lewandowski.
The former Dortmunder Ciro Immomobile has continued to have the best chances of becoming goalkeeper king in the Italian football championship.
At 5:1 (1:1), the former BVB-Profi contributed three hits to Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona, including two eleven meters converted into both halves.
Thus, the 30-year-old has now 34 seasonal gates in his account – just as many scored by FC Bayern Munich in the end of the Bundesliga season.
In Italy, Cristiano Ronaldo follows with up to 30 goals, the Portuguese superstar met with the top rider on Sampdoria Genoa in the evening.
Fleetwood-Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a roller coaster ride: After a rapid ascent with Fleetwood Mac it went down steeply and then slowly up again.
Now Bluesrock guitarist Peter Green died at the age of 73.
Ingenious guitarist, drug junkie, cult followers: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in sleep at the age of 73, family members announced on Saturday in an official statement that another statement would be announced for the next days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton honored Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional response of a "monumental loss" for all former and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had since founded the legendary band in London in 1967, so far his dream instrumental hit "Albatross" is forgotten.
The life of the musician ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") is similar to a roller coaster's ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid ascent - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
Among other things, there should have been a dispute because Green wanted to donate all the Group's winnings for charitable purposes.
He began to appear in wide robes and with a large crucifix.
Mental problems should also have played a role.
Green left the band three years after it was founded in 1970.
It followed a social descent.
The Bluesrock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as cinemas reported.
Green was treated in psychiatry for a long time.
During most of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the picture.
He should have lived on the road for a while, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent a long time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 as the son of a Jewish working family in the London district of Bethnal Green.
In his early years, he was enthusiastic about American blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At eleven years he learned the first guitar grips.
At the age of 15, the teenager started playing professional guitar and five years later was given the chance to be on stage as a lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
He was soon involved in the Bluesbreakers as a replacement for his Idol Eric Clapton.
In the middle of the Blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 together with his bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green, the group created the first number 1 hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted it to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid ascent soon showed its shadow sides: Green did not take hold of the media cluster, his experiments with the drug LSD became ever more extreme.
He later commented on the life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is drugs - the best thing was to land a number 1 hit".
Towards the end of the decade, in 1979, Green was surprisingly successful with a record inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac swims on a success wave without him in new formation.
Her 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Despite several small solos, Green didn't make a big comeback until in 1996 he started a new group of friends.
The British "Daily Telegraph" spoke of a rock star returning to earth at that time.
Free from drugs, Green released some albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band disbanded in 2004.
For music experts he was already a blues legend at the time of his life - and with his gentle sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
