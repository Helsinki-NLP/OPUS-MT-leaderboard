Crying to the World
The market campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland seems to have started off well and shouts and calls out in the wild are now pulling people wide and wide around the world.
"You own the tunnel, I need Iceland," says one woman in the big world in comments on the advertising from the YouTube marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland.
Another spectator said goodbye will keep Iceland in its heart for all eternity and a young woman says she must get to Iceland first and foremost is her fiancée living there.
However, in the United States, she is unhappy and expects to wait for another month.
Another audience asks if the walk to Iceland is good, because there are no planes.
It doesn't tell us if he's from another time zone.
Egill Thordarson of Peel, the advertising office that created the advertising together with the international advertising office M&C Saatchi, says the reception has been hoped again.
“I came across many Inspired By Iceland campaigners who have gone very well, but this new campaign is already being evaluated.
In the foundation this is about creating a PR value, it's getting foreign media to deal with the campaign, and it's been going amazingly well.
Over a relatively short period of time, we have received a worldwide coverage of about seven hundred media, reaching over two billion people.
The value of this coverage is worth $1.8 billion.
It's not that bad."
The main market is the United States, and the campaign has gone very well, even though the Americans are not on their way to the country in the near future.
According to Egils, such markets as Denmark, Britain, and Germany have also welcomed such Russia as a pleasant surprise.
Then there have been reactions from foreign areas, such as India, that were not specifically addressed.
“These ads have gone far beyond what we expected, ” says Egill, who may have seen over four million people watching YouTube.
“We couldn’t have wished for a better start. ”
The pictures here on the opening took the Year of Sea Mountain, the photographer of the Morning Paper, to take pictures of advertisements that bear the title 'Let It Out' in the middle of the month.
The roofs went on wide and wide, such as in the high tower in Reykjavík, in Reynis far, at Forest Phoss, in the Ark of the Sun, and in a cave at the Head of the Brain.
The directors were Samuel Bjarki Petersson and Gunnar Paul Ólafsson at Scottish productions and the taker of the son of Fear of God.
The roles of former Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, from Cuba and Hungary.
While tens of Icelandic people were making the commercials, at the same time as recordings were made in the South, there was another group in the West and West.
According to Egils, "Let It Out" is only the first team in the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, which is aimed at a winter campaign in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
"This is just the first phase of this work for the Icelandic office," says Egill, adding that the cooperation with M&C Saatchi has been extremely successful.
“ Working with them is great.
In such projects, it is very important to have foreign collaborators with knowledge of the markets we are talking to."
Explosive sands: discuss job market positions, income and much more
Mr. Einar Daðason, Minister of Social Affairs and Childhood, will be arriving in Explosive Sand, which will start at 10:00 today on the Wave.
He is also a labour market minister and discusses the position on the labour market as such, the Icelandair and other issues.
He also discusses rural issues and transportation to poor countries that have been controversial in recent years and decades.
Ragnar Thor Ingolfsson, chairman of VR, will also be present, but he will discuss his criticism of investment in life insurance funds and present ideas that labor movement and employers will withdraw from the funds to reduce the risk of economic conflict.
Then will be discussed with Ivar the son of Ingimars, a traveling minister in the East, and with the daughter of Árnhei, the manager of the market place in the north, about the places in the country.
They will look forward to the fall and wonder if summer’s success is a misleading command of what to do.
You can listen to the section below, but it starts at 10:00.
That's what she looks like today 25 years later.
The playwright Elisa Donovan had a successful career in all aspects of youth.
World famous, however, was she played as Amber in Clueess 25 years ago.
Then she also played in Sabrina: The Teenage Witch along with Melissu Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury, and in Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married to one child.
Although she had a look at it recently, she was moved to look over the road and talk about Clueless in an English television on the days.
She talks nice about Brittany Murphy who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she's been a great person.
“ I have to admit that I was mostly based on girls I met at school who were not good to me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who this person was," said Donovan about his game in Clueess.
Didn't want to leave the police station after nightfall.
Today, about fifty cases came at police level in the capital area and reported in the police ’ diary that matters had changed.
The day of the neighborhood police station began with police involvement of a man who had been recently released from a prison cell after staying there because of drunk driving.
The man did not want to leave after he was released and did not obey police orders that told him to leave.
The man earned a continuing stay at the police station because of his progress.
Then a man was arrested in the morning, suspected of burglary in a Copavogi company.
Police also had to be involved in two men in Breiðholti because of reports of a physical attack.
Then, too, a woman who was sitting at the shopping mall in Copavogi could not pay for the bill at the end of a meal and was therefore called to the police.
A stolen car was also reported in the downtown area this morning.
For a moment, a driver of white Renault’s vans looked after her and was then taken without a hand.
The car hasn't been found.
The Curse of the Glee Club - The Horrible Destiny of the Glee Mountains
That theory has been used on the Internet as a curse against the band, but actress Naya Rivera drowned in California on the days and thus became the third major player in the show to allow life to live long before an age.
The components of the joyous band (E. Glee) are a popular series of songs, dances, and joys.
The factions focused on the so - called Jubilee Youths ’ College, their Love, and Destiny.
It was not always taken with the happiness of being in the band, but through singing and dancing, the characters of the elements seemed to overcome any situation that arose in their lives.
But outside the scene, there has been a great deal of disaster over the actors and the employees of the actors, so much so that the teachings have awakened that the curse lies on the parts.
Naya Marie Rivera played a role in Lopez’s role in cheerleaders, who did not call all of their grandmothers.
After the series had run its course, Rivera went to own Ryan Dorsey and had his first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and subsequently understood them.
However, Dorsey refused to file a complaint, and home violence was dropped.
On July 8, last, Rivera was reported to be missing after her four - year - old son was found alone on a boat on Lake Pira, California.
The boy found himself sleeping on a life jacket on board the boat and was able to report to the police authorities that he and his mother had stabbed themselves to death, and Rivera would have brought him back to the boat but would never return to the boat.
Started the extensive search for Rivera.
On the next day, the police chief in the area reported that we were looking from the time Rivera drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and was officially executed.
It is thought to have suffered a great deal of power in the water and to use its last requirement to save the Son.
The cause of death was recorded as drowned by accidents.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith took on the role of Finn Hudson in the role of the American football player with the angel’s reputation, which played a key role in bringing the Gloodship to the fore and respect.
On the outside, however, Moneith struggled with personal demons.
From the age of 13, he had struggled with addiction and found it difficult to escape.
In 2013, his associates found themselves in sufficient numbers, intervened, and urged him to seek help.
Moneith then went to treatment and seemed to look all the way to a better path.
Only two months after finishing treatment, Moneith found himself dead in a hotel room after having had a good time with friends.
Banamein was a fatal combination of drugs and alcohol.
It was not thought that this was a willful act.
Moneith had been treated and his tolerance for drug donors had decreased so much that the dose he had previously tolerated was fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His death was heavy on his associates, but his hostess, Leah Michele, was determined to continue his activities and devoted them to the memory of Moneith and his character Finns.
Mark Wayne Salling took on the role of Noah “Puck” Puckerman, an American footballer, like Finn, and had little respect for his teammates in the Gloods, or until he gained the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his home in Los Angeles and suspected of child pornography.
During a home search at his home, a huge amount of child pornography was found, and soon the matter was publicly questioned.
Apparently, Salling was gone.
As a result, he was accused and convicted of his crimes.
He had a four - to seven - year - old prison in addition to what he would come to have to keep a record of sexual offenders and seek treatment for child - abuse.
Before deciding on the punishment, a judge found Salling, who was then free from bail, left his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It was not just actors of the elements that had fallen from a long time ago.
Jim Fuller was an assistant director of the show.
In 2013, he was in an acute state of sleep, only 41 years of age.
A woman named Nancy Motes was also involved.
She was the younger sister of the great star Julia Roberts and did not carry her sister’s beautiful story, but she accused Roberts of great control and disrespectful behavior.
Motes, who suffered from severe depression, took her own life in 2014.
She left a letter for her fiancé, including her mother and sister, who was responsible for her actions.
“ My mother and my so - called siblings get nothing but the memory that they caused my worst depression. ”
Lea Michel was the star of the elements.
She has recently been accused of using her fellow actors as a bully and a bully at the scene and of having an abundance of stars.
Jesse Luke had a visitor’s role in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with drunk driving in 2019, which was highly scandalous.
Heather Morris, a playwright, played a major role in the program.
It happened in 2010 that tainted computer failure came into nude pictures of it and appeared on the Internet.
The players Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner played both in the parts and had a love relationship outside the parts.
Benoist later reported that Jenner used violence in her relationship.
You can put flowers on almost everything.
Growing up in the garden with their parents will increase the development of their children and help them to grow and thrive.
It is also endlessly possible to do with flowers as the Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just spending time with the children in the park is something that will never be forgotten.
They will remember the blossoms, the aroma, and, of course, the precious time they received with their parents.
Purchased a boat after the tenth grade
"I don't think we're a lot of sailors working in the country's playgrounds," says Axel Eagle Gudmundsson, who is fishing in the summer while taking up psychology at Iceland University during the winter season."
Sea fishing is a very comfortable summer job when you are studying.
If you fish well, you can make good money, and I think it’s great that you can let go of a study loan.
The income also works well for me in the winter," said Axel Örn Gudmundsson, a 25-year-old psychologist who fished for the summer like the last summer.
Axel was the newest to dock at Tálknavärt when a journalist reached a talk from him late in the evening at the beginning of the week."
“ The tenth - grade race I took a boat - management privilege that is less than ten feet [12 m] long, and I bought my boat the summer after finishing primary school.
I've been fishing on my boat all summer ago.
I bought the boat from my acquaintance, Hartmann the son of Jon, and I named it his name.
Hartmann had grown up when I bought the boat and stopped being at sea, and he was very happy when he saw that the boat bore his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took the boat," says Axel, adding that he bought the boat in three million.
“ I made a deal with Hartmann to pay half a million at the beginning of the summer, but the other half at the end of the summer when I had fished.
So at the end of this first summer, I had a boat without debt."
But how could a boy spend a million and a half on a boat when he had just graduated from an elementary school?
“ I had been laying down and collecting money, I had been working with my dad at sea when I was a boy, I was all summer fishing with him, and I had my share.
I also put my square money in my boat fund."
Axel was born at Izaphael, from where all his mother's people are, but he has lived in Copavogi since he was a boy.
“ I can hunt here in the west because I have a legal residence at my grandmother’s home on the Ice Age.
I learned in these areas west of rowing with my dad.
I move from one feather to another, depending on how I feel, because this fishing area covers all over the West.
Although I feel best to be in the west, I have also been around Snowflakes and other areas.
I've also given south, but that's the best of the greys," says Axel, who always beats one fire in the morning and says sometimes talking to the seagulls and singing to the sky, in the solitary hours together out on the ball.
“ The Internet on the ocean is good, so I can call, listen to radio shows, and music.
I don't think it's a good idea to be alone on a boat.
Of course I try to avoid falling into danger, but certainly occasionally something has been weathering, but never much danger," said Axel, who is lucky with the fact that he is never seasick.
He says the length of the working day depends on how the fishing goes.
“ I’ve never been fishing for more than 14 hours at a time, but I’ve also been fishing in other systems, for example in the rent quota, but then I’ve been fishing for a day and a half in the bait in the sea. ”
The beach fishing arrangement says that he is allowed to fish 70 pounds [770 kg] a day, which he considers to be an obstacle.
“ Other restrictions are that I am not allowed to fish Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, and I can only hunt twelve days a month, these four months of shore fishing, in May, June, July, and August.
In my opinion, sailors should choose their hunting days for weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is to be calmed instead of having 48 days throughout the summer and able to choose by its head.
So could the circuit break go for me too, and a television lock that is well located by the fishing grounds should enjoy it," says Axel, who draws the greatest thirst from the salty sea on his shores, but also only wild and unique other species flow with.
Axel works over the winter period with his college degree at Nupi School in Copavogi.
“I don’t think we’re many sailors working in the country’s playgrounds, ” says Axel proudly, adding that he was only going to work temporarily at the playground.
“ I got stuck there because I think this is a great job.
"I hope that my psychology studies will benefit me in the future," says Axel, who also has a long history of business studies.
Registration error prevented you from getting home.
An error in the registration form that people fill out when they arrive in the country caused an individual, resident here on the country, to not be called back to show.
It is not required to file an identification number if the person fills in the form in English, as is the case when doing so in Icelandic.
"This will be examined this week," says a specialist in the field of veterinary medicine.
Three domestic outbreaks were detected at the National Hospital’s viral ward yesterday.
One positive came to the land on July 15, two days after the rule of so - called return protection came into force.
Those who lived in Iceland are then screened at the arrival of the country and again announced in the show four to five days later.
However, on the afternoon news from RUV, it was stated that the person had followed the old system.
The incidence on the borderline was negative, and it was not recalled in the screening for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, a surgeon - in - law expert, says in a conversation with a news agency that this can be attributed to an error in the electronic registration document.
Filling out the registration page in English is not a condition to install a number like the one in the Icelandic version.
After all, it has been thought of primarily by foreign travelers.
Therefore, the person did not receive an automatic invitation to participate in the show.
Kamilla, however, says that many have followed rules on homecoming media, although they have filled the registration form in English, and in some cases employers have also been alert to send people back to show after they arrived in the country.
“This will be examined in the week how to make it easier for people to access them in order to draw their attention to the process. ”
The man is isolated, and six have been hospitalized.
They all go on show, but two of them were starting to show symptoms.
The three infections detected yesterday are now infected, mostly due to two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, the sequence analysis of Ísland gene assays has shown that this is a variant of the corona virus that has not been detected before.
In the second case, the bond has focused on Israel, although it is known that the person who transported the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says it should be there tomorrow when the other virus was coming.
A total of 15 are now in isolation according to the tissue COVID. is.
135 are sick.
Four out of five infections unrelated
Five domestic infections have been reported here in recent days.
Of these, the four alphas are not connected and are not found in the origin of the infection that occurred at the Rey Cup yesterday.
I'm still on the move.
Originally, about three tens of them were sent to the hospital, but they were reduced to sixteen.
Overall, 34 of these new infections were detected yesterday.
This is the second time in a short time that infection is diagnosed at a sporting event and has raised questions as to whether such events should be held.
John K. Johnsson, Chief of Staff at the National Police Department, says it slowly, as long as people follow guidelines and rules.
“We are constantly pressing for all those who live here that individual protection needs to be maintained.
We also need to make it urgent for people who are having an event that there are certain rules that need to be followed.
"Then there's an event," said John.
He says that the air of individual pesticides can prevent infection.
In addition, the rules and standards are subject to constant review.
“What needs to be done, and what the Department of Civil Protection and the National Medical Association are constantly pressing for people, is taking into account these individual vectors.
Both at home and also at service agencies.
People wash their hands and use alcohol.
This prevents the infection from continuing," says John.
“We need to urge people to continue on the good path we were on in order to keep up the results we’ve achieved here.”
40% victimlamba COVID-19 had diabetes 2
Devon Brumfield heard on the phone how difficult her father was going to get the spirit.
Her father had diabetes, so she encouraged him to seek medical help.
The next day, he was dead.
Death was accompanied by sudden breathing difficulties due to coronal viral infections.
Diabetes mellitus was reported on the death certificate as a underlying problem, and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is terrified that the same will happen.
Reuters says fear of Brumfield is not for no reason.
The numbers of new studies conducted by the United States authorities show that almost 40% of those with diabetes 2 died as a underlying disease.
When the proportion of those who did not reach 65 years of age is considered to increase to half.
A study of the U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) included more than 10,000 people in 15 countries who died from the coronin virus during the February to May period.
Jonathan Worthham, a CDC infectious disease expert, says that the results are striking, not least for those diagnosed with diabetes 2 and their loved ones.
Hidden in a slow growth, Reuters conducted a survey, pointing out the answers from the 12 countries that responded to comparable proportions.
10 countries, including California, Arizona, and Colombia, have not yet reported underlying diseases.
“Sickness was already a epidemic of slow growth.
Now the COVID—19 has broken through like a powerful age," Reuters, led by Elbert Huang, president of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes mellitus is more common among blacks and people of southern American origin, who have also become worse out of the coronae virus.
One of the best protections for those with diabetes 2 is to keep the disease in check with a diet that is well - trained, healthy and healthy.
On the other hand, the Korean virus epidemic has made it difficult for many to keep a routine.
In this case, high insulin prices have forced some to continue to be at work and stop exposure to the virus.
Reuters points out that the United States authorities have been able to be aware of the risks that the virus could pose to those with diabetes 2.
When SARS was reviewed in 2003, more than 20% of them had the disease, and in 2009 this group was three times more at risk of hospitalisation.
When MERS did so in 2012, one study revealed that 60% of those who died or were enrolled in intensive care had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a scientist at Yale University, says that because the effects of the COVID-19 virus could be longer, the epidemic would have removed the cover from many previously unknown complications.
“ I fear we will see a flood wave of problems when this is over, ” says Andrew Bolton, president of the International Sugar Association.
Physicians have warned that the CVR may indirectly lead to an increase in diabetic complications, including renal disease and renal dialysis.
Similarly, new studies will focus on increasing the number of cases of diabetes that may result from the coronation virus.
Reuters says that scientists are trying to understand the relationship between the coronin virus and diabetes 2.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs, and kidneys, organs that are already weak in many people with diabetes.
In this case, the high rate of glucose and lipids in diabetic patients can induce a real “cell - signal storm, ” as it is called when the immune system reacts too hard and attacks the body.
Damaged endothelial cells may also lead to inflammation, which in turn may cause fatal blood clots.
“This is all one big puzzle, ” says Dela Cruz.
"It's all connected."
The story has been corrected.
"We were invited to champagne, so they left the room"
The husband Ásrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason made the unusual request of the artist Ragnari Kjartansson to engage in sex in front of a camera for a work that the artist was installing in Paris.
“We loved each other so that it wasn’t complicated.”
Atli Bollason never forgets that when he first met his wife and grandmother, Ásún Magnúsdódur.
“ It made me very fond of her.
It was, of course, just the radiation, but then I thought it was totally unheard of, too.
And still thinks," he says.
At the same time, Ásrún remembers the end of his first meeting regularly.
“ I’m always hearing this story.
The last time was just the weekend," said she, who was also drawn to the husband at first sight.
“I felt and feel so excited around Atla, which I’ve been working on.
There's a lot going on and a lot to do, and I was fascinated by it."
Atli says that he and his wife have stressed their relationship with each other in going their own way.
“ We don’t tie our bags to the same knots as our fellow travelers.
We avoid routines that we detect around us."
This is possible because they took the errand of the Ragnar Kjartan son of a artist only with joy, although it was said to be unusual.
"Our common friend, Kristin Anna, will contact us and ask if we can come and eat dessert with ourselves, Ragga and Ingibjörg of Ragnar's wife, on Snaps."
They accepted the invitation, met the triplet on Snaps, and got a dessert and a dessert.
They listened to Ragnar, who led them through his plans at a picture show that he thought would set up in the Palais de Tokyo in Paris during the fall.
“He had a variety of knowledge shifts called Scenes from Western culture.
He explained it in a simple way."
Ásrún says that he described the work as a banal and decadent late from the everyday life of Westerners.
“He had sketches of all the tendons he was going to shoot and the last time he told us about what he wanted to know if we were interested in participating in.”
Later, Ragnar asked the couple to join in showing a young midwayer to love in a minimalist room.
"It's dating from the beginning and the end," says Atli.
The couple did not know Ragnar very much, although they knew about him, and he “but they knew us and felt fit for this.
They said that they did not want to advertise people.
Maybe they thought that they would not get the right people, but people who had sexual abuse from performing for others."
They voted for Ragnar and agreed to think the matter over, but it did not take long.
“ When we walked out of Snaps, we said, ‘ Aren’t we just ready for this? ’
It was just like that.
I trusted Ragnar as an artist and his entire team," says Ásrún and Atli.
"This is about love and neighbor"
Senan was taped in a fine apartment on the Muargåt.
There was a very small film studio; a cameraman, Ragnar, and a musician, and the couple.
After the recording had been set on, everyone left the room to wait outside in a car except Atli and Ásrún.
“We didn’t decide what we should be like.
We received some advice, but we tried to forget time and place.
To be unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
It wasn't a game, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated," said Ásrún.
But was that romantic?
"Yes, it was a bit romantic," says Atli and Ásrún.
“ We were invited to champagne before they left the room.
It was a little bit like being on vacation at a nice hotel in Paris."
The team was pleased with the couple’s performance in the work that moved them.
“ When Tommi was watching this, he cried, he thought it was so beautiful, ” says Atli.
“It’s as much about love and closeness as it is about intercourse, ” says Ásrún.
The couple’s parents saw the work and told Atli that his mother heard the voice in the Son of the Reykjavik Collection, and they realized that he was part of the work.
"Then she turns around and starts thinking about it," says Atli.
“ Mom and Dad saw this in Paris.
We hadn't told anyone that way, but then my dad sent me a message and said, "Fucking the little family in Palais de Tokyo," Ásrún recalls.
And do you think participation in the work has deepened the relationship between Ásún and Atla?
“At least we’re still together, so maybe it got deeper.
This at least deepened my relationship with the family in-law," said Ásrún and laughed.
Ásrún himself saw the work in Copenhagen with his colleague.
“I felt so hard not to be with you but someone else,” she says, turning to her husband.
“But it was nice to see this, because it’s just one late in a much bigger job, and when you saw it with the other effects, it’s really cool.
I was able to get away from it a little bit and was just proud.
And there was the little beans in my stomach," said Ásrún, who was pregnant by one of the couple's children when the tendon was picked up.
"It was just beautiful."

Swansea with victory in the first game
Swansea won a 1-0 win on Brentford in a dramatic game.
This was the first game of the team in the lead in the review to get up into the original English section.
The game took place at Swansea’s home site in Wales.
Half-game position was 0-0.
The home of Swansea received hell in 64 minutes, but Andre Ayew failed the bulwark of the white spot and was protected.
Just two minutes later, Rico Henry, actor Brentford, received the red card.
So Brentford played the rest of the game less, and in 82 minutes, Swansea’s new team member.
Andre Ayew then added up the plumbing by cutting a great mark and securing Swansea 1–0 victory.
So Swansea leads 1-0 in the monologue, but the second game will take place next Wednesday at Brentford's home.
Free of charge for five years from 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the U.S. ambassador in Iceland, is in the spotlight of the media after CBS reported this morning that he wanted an armed bodyguard where he feared for his life.
However, it has not been difficult for the President of the United States to appoint ambassadors here on land.
Since Carol Van Voorst left the U.S. ambassador’s office at the end of April 2009, the country has been left entirely unsolicited for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voort was out of office in exceptional circumstances, but Kastjous reported in 2009 that she should have received the Falka word.
During a farewell meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a call from the Presidential Office that she would not be honoured.
After leaving Iceland, she taught international relations with Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until Van Voorst, in September 2010.
Somehow, Robert S. Connan was appointed as a ambassador, but then he stopped.
At last, Loius Ariega had served in the foreign service for decades.
In the fall of 2013, he took up the post of ambassador in Guatemala.
At that time, another period of unsolicited missionary service took place.
Robert Barber received the agreement of the United States Congress in January 2015 and arrived shortly later, but no ambassador had been there for 13 months.
Barber was appointed politically but not diplomati, but had served as a lawyer and supported Barack Obama’s campaign fund.
He resigned as Donald Trump took the office of President, January 20, 2017, as his habit is with a politically appointed ambassador.
Trump’s government was unusually long to appoint both ambassadors and senior officials in the Washington government.
So it took two years for the U.S. Congress to announce to Jeffrey Ross Gunter a meeting to ask him out and finally confirm that he was a ambassador in Iceland.
In his testimony at Congress, he said he never came to Iceland but often to Western Europe, but his late wife had been broken by a Dutch mountain.
Gunter was a former skin doctor in California and has been prominent in the Jewish community in the Republic group, Republican Jewish Coalition.
The gambling owner Sheldon Adelson founded them as an organization, but Adelson is an intense supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, but then no ambassador had been in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest case in the country.
The reason for this is both how long Trump’s control was to appoint key officials who have worked very hard in recent years, including the confirmation of ambassadors in office.
As of 2009, therefore, Iceland has been unsolicited for more than five years.
However, this has not prevented projects by the embassy that opened a recently opened headquarters at Engageg.
The operations are estimated to have cost about 6.5 billion, but knee thick safety walls surrounding the building and bulletproof glass are in all windows.
However, it does not seem to have enough to fill the current ambassador’s sense of security, for he is said to be afraid of his life and has wished for an armed bodyguard.
IBV's former player was racist in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland"
Tonny Mawejje, former IBV player, claims to have suffered racism when he was in Iceland and that he regrets having come to the country.
This is seen in an interview with Tonny, which appears on the Daily Monitor in Uganda.
Tonny recently joined Uganda Police FC, which plays in Uganda’s top division.
During the interview with the Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about a lot, including his time here on land, but he played with IBV, Val and Trätti in Iceland.
“ When I came to Iceland, I didn’t play in the middle like I used to.
The leader of the team was in that position, but in addition he also had the jersey number that I wanted so I didn't get any of what I wanted," said Tonny, but he played on the right side of the season with IBV.
Among the things that Tonny talks about is the racism he experienced in Iceland.
He says this is a problem many black players face when playing in Europe.
“ This happened to me once, but since I didn’t understand the language, I just ignored what was being said to me.
Later I heard about the matter, and then I asked my friend what it was all about.
Then he told me that my adversary caused a racist speech to fall upon me after I had taken him."
In 2014, Tonny went from Iceland to Norway, where he joined Haugesund.
That's where he says he's made the biggest mistakes he ever notices.
Tonny hadn't gotten into Haugesund's first team but he wanted to play more to get into the national team.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland on loan, but he went to help Val.
“It was a mistake to come back to Iceland for a loan.
I think that if I had been longer in Norway, I would have had the opportunity I wanted," said Tonny but he hoped that if he would play well in Norway he would probably get further.
He wants to mean that the loan to Iceland has done away with his dreams of getting into the big league in Europe.
Find worms in the neck of a woman
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8-bit black worm in a woman's neck gland that searched there.
Doctors were able to pull out the worm by pliers.
A study showed that parasites were involved.
CNN will report this.
A few days earlier, the woman had eaten sashimi, which is thin cuts.
The woman soon improved after the worm was removed, but parasites such as these are often in raw meat or fish.
According to CNN, after sushi knocked herself into bed in the West, there have been cases where parasites have spread to people.
Fear of another wave emerging in Europe
Spain is now on the verge of worrying about another corona virus wave in Europe, where governments have taken action to reinvigorate the spread of the siron virus epidemic.
In Catalonia, all entertainment has been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where infection is increasing.
Other European countries have also taken action to increase infection in Spain, but in the United Kingdom, everyone has to get sick of returning from Spain, as in Norway, and France has been warned about travelling to Spain.
In France and Germany, the government is also trying to find a balance between reinvigorating the virus and reintroducing its economy.
The situation in Europe, however, is good from elsewhere in the world, but the prevalence of transmission worldwide is approaching 300 thousand a day, with the highest rates of transmission in America and South Asia.
According to John Hopkins University, confirmed infections have reached 16 million worldwide and have been confirmed to be viral-related deaths to 644 thousand.
At Last, Mosaic Works Will Enjoy Their Fullest
In front of the House in Reykjavík, there's a big deep hole.
It contains orange helmets.
There's a big grave there, too.
And more smaller machines.
The street is closed for traffic.
However, the footstep is a good one, and many people now stop and respect the work of millions of Moosaic tiles — as they have never seen before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At least it doesn't matter.
The work here has been hidden quite a bit, right in front of it was a parking lot that was always surrounded.
People put it there, locked the car in a hurry, and then set out to take care of their business in the city center.
'Live and diverse public spaces' and 'attractive urban centres' are a guiding principle for the current redevelopment of the Security Road.
The goal is to please the area and allow the mosaic work of the Holy Daughter of the House to enjoy a better view.
In front of the job there will be squares, and since the area is well situated at the sun, it is thought to be suitable as a sleeping area for passersby.
The work of art will be illuminated, and now the material tree will enjoy itself better than before on this 142 - square - foot [122 sq m] surface.
In the area, there will also be tiny fogging sprayers, some kind of water bulwarks, that offer a game and give the area some cover.
In this way, the improvements are described by the city of Reykjavik, which is being carried out together with the Witnesses.
The layers of water, heating, and electricity will be renewed.
Many of them have come to their age, but since 1925 they have served local residents and businesses in the middle of the century.
When the road is reopened at the end of the project, cars can rerun it.
However, it will be a unique street and, at the same time, a quieter and accessible space for walking.
In a fraternity about the Toll House on the customs director’s website, the house was used in 1971, an architect named Gísli Halldórsson.
Because of the damage to the harbor through the house, 250 square feet [250 sq m] of window - free wall panels were formed to the street.
The building committee and the architect agreed that such a flat would adversely affect the overall view, if no special arrangements were made to adorn the appearance of the house.
Thus, members agreed to do the math by having a permanent work of art set up there.
At that time, a great deal of words went out of the Holy Father’s daughter, an artist, says in the summary.
Had she done much of the mosaic work in Germany and elsewhere?
It was decided to first contact her before deciding whether or not to compete.
The work had often been discussed as to the need for a mirror of life at the port, since Reykjavík had been a vessel’s nest ever since it was built.
When talking to the artist, she had to keep her mind on such a work.
It was agreed that she would get plans and other assistance before she left the country, where she would work on the foreign proposals.
Made up of the time she had to decide for herself, and when she returned home, she made some suggestions for discussion.
It was agreed without delay to ask her to do the work.
In addition, it was desirable to enter into an overall agreement with her and the famous art trade firm in Germany, the Brothers Oidtmann, who had long worked with them to set up famous works of art in all parts of Europe.
The contract was concluded, and Gerður performed the work of art in the work of the brothers, who then performed the work at the House of Customs.
The whole work was extremely well done, both by the half of the Holy Father and by the Oidtman’s brothers, says in the summary.
Ever since then, it has resisted a harsh Icelandic weather.
It took him about two years to do the work, which was performed and installed in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after completion of the Tollhuswerk, only 47 years old.
Preparing to move more organizations to the country
Minister of Social Affairs Ásmund Einar Dadason announces that more public institutions will be moved to the country in the near future.
This was said by a minister in the program Explosive on the Wave at noon.
It has recently been reported that the Home and Human Resources Office burnout area will be moved north in the fall of the Flanders in the fall.
Six experts in the field of fires work at the Agency, but none of them intend to follow the Agency north and have criticised the migration of livestock by firefighters and medical workers.
“ I think we should take another step in this creature.
I'm preparing for another step in this creature.
"More transportation," said Ásmundur.
If he is convinced that the vast majority of the nation wants to see greater distribution of public institutions around the country, he is convinced.
"I think it's necessary to make further political decisions on the transport of public services to the country, as I was doing with the Ministry of Housing and Humanities," said Ásmundur, who also took examples of other institutions that have been transferred to the country and was very important to communities in the country, such as the Transport of Food Agency to Selfos, Iceland's measurements to Akranes and the unemployment insurance company on Skagan.
All the most important things from the second day of the Meisteramot
94th Iceland's Grand Prix in Free Sport ended today at the Thorsvelt in Akureyri.
A few conventions were held on the second day of the contest.
An exciting competition in women's besieging at Thorsvell was calculated, while Vigdi's daughter of FH put Icelandsmet in a strike in 2014, which lasted until Elizabeth Rut Rúnarsdóttir from the IR added to his assessment in May last year.
Vigdis won Iceland's last summer, but she's been doing Iceland's final assessment of what's left of the summer.
Elizabeth Ruth has been wrestling with injury and has not recovered today.
She had only one large, five - tossed roll of 25,69 feet [25,69 m], which is far from her best.
Vigdis threw the longest of all today, or 60.08 meters in her last attempt, and as a result, he countered.
She put her Icelandic record earlier in July of 62.69 meters and was therefore a bit from there.
Gudrun Karitas Hallgrím’s daughter from the IR had the second best shot of the day, but she improved her best performance with a throw of 50.18 feet [50.18 m].
In a men's group, Hilmar Örn Jonsson, Iceland's best player, won a safe victory, but he threw 73.84 feet in his next last throw and put a countermeasure.
His Iceland record in the article is 75.26 meters.
Guður Gudnason, the Olympics, and the Iceland Meteoric in the round, won a competition on a radio at Thorswelt yesterday, but today he competed in a roundabout, his main feature.
The Icelandmet Gudna Vals is 65.53 meters, but he threw a maximum of 59.13 meters today and secured his victory.
Valdimar Hjald son of Erlendsson threw at the second end of the day, but he had one match that worked at the 2nd, a quarter - foot [49.43 m].
Hafdi's Victory Daughter, Iceland's Long-Sleeved Sea, won the Long-Sleeved Long-Sleeved Race, but Hafdi's leap reached a maximum of 6,25 meters today, which is about 40 cm from her Icelandic record.
In the 200-metre run of women, it was the IR Gudbjörg Jona Bjarnadfóttir who was the hardest, but she scored 24,04 seconds, but her Iceland record in the article is 23.45 seconds.
Gudbjörg Jona won a prize in Akureyri, where she won two gold prizes last night, 100 yards [100 m], and 4 x 100 meters [100 m], including 4 x 400 meters [400 m] today.
In a male group, the first goal of the 200 - foot [200 m] race in 21,57 seconds, was to be met by Colbeinn Höður Gunnarsson from the FH, a 0.3 - seconds pre - Oliver Mona Samuel Son of the Year.
Like God - saved Jona, Francis Håder won gold in 100 yards yesterday as well as in the 400 - foot [400 m] race.
Does not receive a fine for a $27 million bitcoin crop
A tax committee has rejected the tax investigator’s requirement that you be fined for misappropriating your financial resources that were available for the sale of an electric coin Bitcoin.
The committee concludes that the tax investigator had not provided clear evidence as to why it was necessary to fine the man.
The Committee’s decision states that the tax investigator considered the person to be eligible for materially incorrect tax returns for the financial years 2016 and 2017.
He would have unprovoked his financial resources, which were available for the sale of an electric coin of Bitcoin of 27 million, either willful or of enormous carelessness.
The guilty man is guilty of his conduct.
So the man refused in a letter to the committee.
He did agree, however, to have sold electric coins for 27 million in 2016.
He would have had his inheritance in 2009 and 2010, when such things would have been both easy and unencumbered with a normal home computer.
Then he pointed out that when he sold the electric coins, tax executions for such sales had been far from clear and unpredictable.
It would have been foolish to expect public citizens to appreciate such arrangements on a tax return.
He would not have avoided paying taxes on the harvest and would have recognized his property as a contribution in a price - tax bill.
He would have asked both the experts and the government’s tax administrator how this was going to be done and how it would be ineffective.
Then he thought he would have to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he began digging for Bitcoin.
Thus, he would have been in worse position than others to study complex rules that tax authorities would not have made clear.
The man rightly felt that his taxes for those two years of income would be readjusted and burdened, but otherwise no penalty would be imposed.
Then he withdrew from his job in Iceland and paid taxes here from 2012 onwards.
He never intended to get away from his duties in an improper way.
The requirement for a fine would be out of the ordinary and would lead him into debt.
Brynjolf says, "This man understands what football is"
Andersen Willumsson's Brnolf has been a lot between his teeth on people, but he has also been impressed by his performance of the time spent at the Breitzeit in Pepsi Max.
Blinks will be in the fire line tonight when they receive the IA on live broadcast at Station 2 Sport.
Then, for four reminders of the season, Brno will not be played with a new clip like in summer’s games.
He had “blah, blah, blah” written on his head for the game at HK last Thursday, which HK won from 1 to 0.
“ I don’t know who exactly he was answering with the payment, but speaking of character, this one was more trying in the game.
He didn't hide.
He wants to get the ball every time and if there was someone going to equal this game then I thought he would do it or make it," said Gudmundur Benedictsson in the Pepsi Max booth, when it was considered to have arrived at Bryn Christmas.
"I'm supposed to be here for the people."
“ It’s hard at times to figure out where he is.
He looks a little out on the left when it's going to suffer the game, but he's got a very free roll in the team," said Hjörvar Hafländason.
Dreckell Máni Petersson says Brynjölf’s real fun and rejoices to have such a colorful man in the department: “No one argues that this is character.
This is a fun type and I love this with my hair, and being always ready to show up and answer interviews.
There's an amazing amount of people occupied by him, who tell me that this man understands what football is.
“ I’m an entertainer.
I'm supposed to be here for the people and enjoy it."
The people are reading the interviews with Brynjölf, people are paying in and watching what is next to his hair.
This man is just a genius," said Monny.
Player KR says he wants to leave the partner - "I've been in contact with a couple of B-departments"
Tobias Thomsen, KR player in Pepsi Max, seems to be leaving the team.
According to Bold, Tobias is ready to go back to Denmark.
Football.net also reported the case.
Tobias wants to get to the beginning of the period in his native country, but for this he must first cancel his contract with KR, where the Danish department begins before the Icelandic odds.
The company knows I miss Danmark and has shown me a lot of understanding," said Tobias in conversation with Bold.
“I’ve been in contact with a few members of the B division and will probably switch before the Icelandic period ends.
There are not many people in Denmark who can afford to pay up my contract with KR."
Then he says that he is likely to have to take on an increase in wages in Denmark.
"It is likely that partners in Denmark have felt more about the economic impact of the virus than in Iceland."
The Witch of the Wheel has recovered a wheel for millions - Now answers for itself after discussing DV
For over a year, unlike most others, Bjartmar Leosson has had interests.
He smells and saves lost and stolen bicycles, electric bicycles, and wallets.
Bjärtmar has earned the name “the biker ” for this purpose.
Yesterday, as one published an account of one’s dealings with Bjartmar, there became so much complacency.
DV then referred to the Facebook group of Westerners, where it was noted that Bjartmar had taken the man to speak in the East and said that his purse might be stolen.
It was not possible to read from the original writings of the electrician but that Bjärtmar taught him to be a thief.
The text has now been changed on Facebook and the title of the original news DV has been updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says that the original news of the matter is not at all descriptive of what really went on yesterday in the East.
He said that he had been informed by a victim of electric bats that these were really his electronic kittens.
The information received an alleged owner from another, but the information proved to be incorrect, says Bjartmar.
“ I saw the guy, and I knew about the shuttle, because with information that there was a bugger who had been missed for a very long time and was looking for it.
I hesitated, of course, first, but when I saw him preparing to drive on the shuttle, I decided to go and talk to the man.
The owner was certain of his fault, so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general, I do very well in such a case, but before I finished what I had to say, the man had taken away me."
Bjartmar says that the man in the electric cauldron immediately invited him to show him the receipt for the bike and called the police themselves.
"Yes, great," said Bjartmar, "let's just get this straight."
Then the owner of the electric school proved ownership at his electric school and set out.
Later, the owner’s court told his story on Facebook, as reported in the previous report.
In this more than one year of his work, Bjartmar claimed that he could count the times he faced people with fingers of another hand.
“I have had peaceful relations with the most difficult men of Reykjavík, ” said Bjartmar, pointing out that the most common among the smallest of the brothers and sisters in the community, fiends, insane people, and other people on the street for some reason.
“The addiction is hard on a master, and somehow the next dose needs to be financed, ” says Bjortmar.
“ My relationship with these people is really so good that I’ve brought many of the good people with me.
For example, people went to treatment and then approached me and helped me with what I am doing," he says.
In general, Bjärtmar’s dealings with wheelchairs are based on polite notes.
Some know about him and what he is doing and offer him peacefully in order to show him receipts, wheel dials, and so forth.
The issue of bicycleft is a major problem that has not been addressed.
Furthermore, Bjartmar says that police have even begun to point out that they are talking to him because of stolen bicycles.
Brightly opposed to previous news coverage, DV claims not to be some sort of self-directed police force in a personal search for justice.
Asked if he is still not on the heel of his activity, and whether this is not primarily the role of the police, says Bjartmar so certainly.
“ Of course the police should do this, but the fact is, the police are simply not doing this.
I've been looking up at policemen driving away from a huge pile of stolen wheels.
She's plainly said without a grudge in these matters."
“When the cops don’t do anything about it, and this is just in front of your nose, and the experience has shown that I can succeed in this matter, then why not?” asked Bjartmar.
He claims that he has achieved so much success in riding stolen bicycles that sometimes he encounters his “clouders ” on the street that they were only right at the Bjartmar bikes they had previously acquired.
The times that Bjartmar has called after the police's assistance have caused her simply not to come.
“It’s just not working with the police, and it’s not my fault and it’s not the owner of the bicycles to teach,” said Bjartmar and regrets that victims of bicycleft have to suffer for the emptiness of the police in this category.
There is no dispute about the results of Bjartmar.
We can find stories of people thanks to Mr. Bjartmar for having restored their possessions to them.
Bjartmar himself says that he has long lost the number of bicycles he has delivered, but the ups are likely to run on millions, if not millions.
It weighs electricity loads, electric bicycles, and electric bicycles, but an electric wheel can cost less than half a million.
He works day by day at a school, and every other weekend he works in a community.
So his bicycle search is unpaid work that he does in his spare time.
Life insurance funds and long shadows
In 2019, there was a lot of birthdays in Iceland’s island fund history.
True, the government had received a retirement from all the 19th - century Danes, which in 1919 was the establishment of an official’s pension fund that eventually resulted in the retirement of all public employees.
The foundation of the current life insurance fund of general wage earners was then laid with a comprehensive labour market agreement in 1969, with a job-related pension fund with a compulsory and full - time fund allocation from 1970.
In 1974 laws were then enacted on the basis of these agreements, and the ecosystem continued to grow thereafter.
The payroll system was not the only radical change that motivated the labor movement of the 20th century by its nuclear struggle.
In 1955, unemployment insurance had similarly been obtained in a history - renowned strike campaign, as well as the organization gradually advanced its claim for sickness rights and sickness funds, substantial leave rights, the shortening of working hours, the improvement of housing, and more as much as possible.
All these rights cost a great and strict struggle, but they were found to be far greater and more lasting than the increase in the price of the money, which disappeared as quickly as it was in the hot inflation that marked the postwar period and until 1990 as many remember.
The contributor to the establishment of a public pension fund in 1969 was both long and complex.
In the end, although it was decided that the funds would actually be owned by a social partner, the labor force had to agree that their governments would be appointed representatives of employers and social partners alike.
In the next few years after the establishment of the funds, the requirement for the majority of employees in the management of the funds was often discussed in the payroll organisations, but it was never achieved, so we are still faced with the unusual arrangement that representatives of the social partners are not in the majority of the governments of the funds.
The 36th article of Law No 129/1997 on the Liability of Life-Earth Rights and the Activities of Life-Earth Funds deals with the investment policy of the funds.
It says in paragraph 1 that “a life insurance fund should be guided by the interests of partners. ”
The fifth section also states: “A budget for life will set itself moral standards in investments. ”
In the cooperative policy of storekeepers, the following provisions are included, in addition to the aforementioned legal provisions:
The United Nations (UN PRI) rules on responsible investments, along with many of the largest investment funds and professional investments in the West and in Europe.
The rules address how emphasis on environmental and social issues as well as good governance can contribute to improved investment performance in a stock exchange.
This brings together the interests of society in a broader context.
LV considers it important that companies, in particular those registered on the stock market, adopt a public policy: to maintain good governance in order to maintain a working level of social responsibility and environmental responsibility.
The capital stock of Gildi, which has the largest funds in the country, has set itself a 'responsible investment policy' and there are similar provisions.
This is all reflected here as an introduction to the latest fashion term of Icelandic, “shadow control. ”
Since the word is new in the case, it is not hoped that it has been carefully defined, but I now see the following definition as being “most taken”: Shadow control is when a trade union leader says in the media that he is going to send recommendations or instructions to representatives of the company in the management of an island fund or how to take a stand on a specific matter.
If they fail to comply, they will be let go of the government at the first opportunity.
Of course, if the director does not take this to the media and does not speak of resignation, then it is not “shadow control ” because such relationships are always in the financial world as elsewhere.
I leave the reader to meditate on how he feels “more shadowy. ”
There are in particular two men who have tried to shape this definition when it is written, on Saturday, July 25, 2020.
It is the hard man, the hard man, the son of Igi, who is a journalist of the News, and the governor of Ásgeir, the son of Jon, of the bankers.
The proposal by both of them arose after the president of Icelandair, Bogi Nils Bogason, had announced his intention to terminate the company’s contracts with airmen and pilots (saying them out), and Ragnar Thor Ingolfsson, president of the Reykjavík Trade Union, sent them these recommendations to the representatives of the company in the management of the Shoppers’s Lifey Fund not to support the possible purchase of the funds in the partner’s shares, otherwise they might be killed.
Some time later, Bogi Nils withdrew his decision, and then Ragnar Thor made the same recommendation, which naturally reflected on Boga’s decision.
Nevertheless, they saw reason for the increase in Friday’s issue in the newspaper The News, with great words about shadow management, law enforcement, and the need for changes in the law.
There, a small dungeon would certainly have been tossed, even though it had been blessed in the way of annexation and was quickly wiped out.
Since the matter is important, let us consider the material itself at the end.
I outlined the points in the law on an island fund that submits to this matter.
These include the need to safeguard the interests of social partners and to maintain moral standards in investment, and these points are further elaborated in both the Gildis and the Lifey Business Administration, as I mentioned.
On the other hand, life insurance funds should NOT look only at short - term savings banks in their investments.
Such a course would be very dangerous, and it does not have to be a long time to look for examples of such things in the past, as large banks and funds have gone to immoral adventurers and environmentalists, with disastrous consequences.
The head of Icelandair was obviously in the middle of ice when he thought of wiping out a whole group of employees, thus greatly reducing the well - being that the partner has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position toward investors.
Fortunately, he saw and pulled this back.
Time indicates that it will be sufficient for the investment of life insurance funds in the partner to be considered responsible for the existence of social security funds.

One of the infected was not receiving a home invasion
One of the three identified with Covid-19 in the country yesterday came to the land of the Baltic States on July 15, last year, about a week and a half ago.
However, he is not a regular resident of Iceland, so he did not receive clear guidance on how to use so - called home disease after coming to the country and going to another show a few days after arrival.
He got a negative scan at the border.
“But he’s in an Icelandic community and, in fact, he’s supposed to be on that resource,” says Kamilla Josepsdóttir, a country doctor’s nurse’s specialist and a local health surgeon during his summer vacation, in a conversation with the newspaper today.
"He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the ID number and if the ID is not recorded then you are not automatically announced in the later show."
She says that the man could have used the English registration form because he is actually living abroad, but because of his connection with the country as an Icelandic, he should have used it more.
However, he did not realize this.
“ When the idiom is not recorded, you need to apply for the second performance yourself.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realized that this was the right way," says Kamilla.
“ Thus, it is clear that we need to increase the information about this while we find some way to do an automatic preaching system, even if the Icelandic people do not register their teaching numbers.
Or to make it somehow clearer who are members of the Icelandic community in the registration system," she explains.
Happily, though, the person is not allowed to enter the country, although he is defined as a member of an Icelandic community, a resident of Iceland.
Only six have been sent to the hospital after he was diagnosed yesterday and all six have been in contact with him.
They're going to show up, but two of them are starting to show the signs of Covid-19 infection.
The man was negatively exposed to the border on July 15th.
Kamilla is likely to say that he was recently infected with the virus that she was not yet able to detect in him when the test was taken at the border.
But she doesn't want to rule out that the man has been infected here in Iceland, but she doesn't bring the virus to the country.
“It’s not quite possible to claim that this is definitely infected because it’s been a long time since he came to the country that he could have been exposed here like these two who have made a little noise in connection with the sports conventions.”
It says that, though, it is very unlikely because of the few people around here.
“It’s actually very unlikely,” says Kamilla, but notes that it cannot be excluded until an Icelandic genetic analysis has sorted the human virus.
“If we get a virus type that hasn’t been seen here before, it’s almost certain that he carried it to the country.”
Piper Spray and bombs used against Protestants
There was a conflict between the Seattle Police and Protestants tonight.
The Protestants used pepper sprey and nonfatal hand bombs, but protesters broke the windows and set fire to fire.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were injured.
Police violence and racial prejudice were protested in many parts of the United States last night, but the protests in Seattle were in support of protesters in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one Protestant was shot to death.
According to the BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands met in peaceful protests.
A group of people then set fire to a building site and broke a window in the city courthouse.
Subsequently, the protests were denounced by the police, and protests were fought between protesters and police.
Claiming justice In Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, a 23 - year - old black man murdered by the police in August last year, was remembered by Protestants.
A car drove through a group of Protestants in the city, but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of members of the Black National Guards gathered and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26 - year - old black woman who was murdered by the police in her home in March last year.
The group carried firearms and joined forces at closed malls, where the police were in charge of a group of people who protested and also carried firearms.
Then there were 75 arrests in Omaha, Nebraska, where Protestants remembered James Scurlock, a 22 - year - old black man who was murdered by a white barrister in May.
Sunshine: Not the game that defines our season
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, soccer manager Manchester United, does not want to make too much of the importance of the game at Leicester today in the final round of English selection.
If the United loses the game, and the Chelsea does not lose against Wolves, the End of the Sunsk and his men in the 5th seat and thereby lose out of the Master's seat.
Then, however, they should still hope to get to the Master’s Office by working for the European Union next month.
“We haven’t reached the end.
If we reach a point against Leicester, I think people will say that we haven't had a bad time now," said Solskjær.
“But whatever happens, this isn’t the end of our journey because we still have a lot of land to catch up with the two teams above us,” said Solskjær.
Clearly, the nerves of humans will be thwarted at 15 a.m. today, but Solskjärn tried to pretend that every other game was involved.
“ If you want to belong to Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
This isn't new, and it's where the partner lives.
We've created a great opportunity to finish the season well and now it's ours to take advantage of it," said Solskjær.
“This isn’t the most important game of the season, it’s just the next game.
You can ask anyone in the football, the next game is always the most important one.
The outcome does not define our period; we have already had many hours to define this period."
“ Bruno Fernande’s coming changed a lot for us, and I believe that we are in a better shape and much stronger spiritually than in the last period of time, ” said Solskjär.
65,000 infections on a day-to-day basis
65,490 new coronin virus infections were detected in the United States yesterday, according to John Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 infections have been confirmed in the West from the beginning of the epidemic there.
900 died from the virus yesterday than in the last four days until viral death was more than 1,000 a day.
A total of 146,460 viral deaths have been confirmed in the United States.
According to CNN’s forecast, the number of viral deaths will reach 175,000 August 15th.
Fear of a Second Wave of the Epidemic
The government of Spain is now trying to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the country from becoming weaker.
The Spanish health authorities reported over 920 new cases of COVID-19, both on Thursday and Friday.
There have been no more reports in one day since May, and reports are coming at the same time as the Spanish begin to remove one of the most stringent curfews in Europe.
The setback led to British authorities now requiring passengers from Spain to be hospitalized at home.
A week earlier, Spain was on the British list of safe states.
The situation is worse in Catalonia, in northeastern Spain, where governments have taken on more extensive restrictions to try to match the growth rate.
In the capital city of Barselona, entertainment sites will be closed for the next two weeks and wave houses will be closed at midnight.
The curfew is now valid for 200 thousand people in Segria County in western Catalonia.
It is believed that the decision taken by the United Kingdom will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which is very angry at the arrival of foreign travelers and is badly affected by the epidemic.
Tui, Britain’s largest travel agency, canceled all scheduled flights to Spain and the Canary Islands today.
Governments around the world are said to prepare themselves for the second wave of the epidemic, but there seems to be little interest in resuming a massive ban that has ruined the economy in many areas.
To form, British prime minister Boris Johnson has taken such things very badly and has compared them to nuclear weapons that he does not want to use.
Then the Prime Minister of France, Jean Castex, said that the nation “would not survive, economically or socially, ” in the event of a national ban.
Many councillors hope that local resources that will reach the inhabitants of individual towns, cities, or areas will be sufficient to hold back the virus in the next round if it arrives.
Five new infections in Iceland - Three domestic
Three domestic transmissions were detected yesterday, plus two more at the border.
Thus, five individuals with positive Covid-19 infection were identified yesterday in Iceland.
According to a general report, one infection is associated with the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football tournament.
He has been sent to solitary confinement and sixteen who were in close contact with him in a state of sickness.
As part of the social work of a sports association in Reykjavík, the infected person is reported to be “only part of the sports team ” in disease.
Others who were being sent were related in a different way to man.
The origin of this infection is undetected and is fully infected by the National Police Department.
The ReyCUP convention delegates have followed the guidelines and rules of the current and current medical and public safety authorities and have taken appropriate measures.
However, pictures of the convention were last seen in a very close relationship to celebrate the good flow of his team on the field.
Just before 11 a.m. today, the conventioners published the following announcement on their Facebook page.
It reads: “ATH: Parents, please respect the rules for competitors to pick up their own stuff at school.
Parents are NOT allowed to do so.
Thank you for your understanding."
Another infection was detected yesterday, but it is related to the infection reported in the morning.
Says the report: “Icelandic genetic analysis has sorted the infection and revealed a new type of virus that has not been detected before. ”
In this case, it is also contaminated and 12 infected by the infection.
The third infection in question is from a man who came to Iceland 11 days ago, July 15.
He was diagnosed at the southwest corner of the country.
He is now in isolation and six who were in close contact with him as a disease.
Two of them are already showing signs of viral transmission.
In addition, two were identified at the border and are asked for the results of further studies, such as an infectious procedure at the border.
Finally, the report states: The National Police Department and the National Inspector’s Office urge people to take care of each individual vector.
If there is any doubt as to the presence of the signs and symptoms of the Covid-19 virus, the same one is asked to be screened at the nearest health care centre.
Patrey's ferry says the tent area is booked on the weekend of shopping - direct guests other
The tabernacle of Patrech is fully booked this weekend, according to the report of the people of the West.
Visitors should be advised to consider alternative accommodation options.
The names of the West Bildu Valley, Tálknáfjörð, Melanes, Hötel Flokalund, and Hötel Breiðavik as other options in the situation.
There is enough to be at the passover of this weekend; for as in the first years, the city of Skäld, a feast of Icelandic documentarys is held in the city.
It has been held since 2007 and has become a strong tradition in town.
If the weather does not put a line in the bill, a good date can be expected for this year, but DV told us earlier today of a bad prediction.
But the worst of the south weather is to be expected, and the hope of the head of the passover.
The webster bb.is first told me that all other accommodations in town were already fully booked.
A whole multi-detached house caves down to the best place in the city
Romanian workers live free in Dunhaga 18-20.
During the process of obtaining a building permit, the owners of the facility have been rolling over the system for the third year.
In one oldest, grandest, and most expensive neighborhood of Reykjavík, a magnificent three - story apartment complex stands.
On the ground floor of the house is about 600 square feet [600 sq m] of shopping space.
Behind the house are the doors of two stairwells, each holding four or more magnificent apartments.
They range between 93 and 130 square metres, although most of them exceed 100.
The house has a lot of history.
It was built in 1959, including a video store, a bathroom, a milk store, a gunsmith, a fish shop, and now a school portrait.
The house has, to the point of being mild, remembered its fiftieth beauty.
The house is now under severe damage, as shown in the accompanying pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 hf.
The owners of D18ehf are listed among other Magnússon and Gudrunn Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnús served as the owner of the Payup Group and was a defender of the Payup Society.
Among the owners of the Paying Company is Steel Ship.
The steel ship of Haf is a God-run investment company, the daughter of Saint Laarus and her children.
Gudrun is also the owner of the third part of D18 hf.
Gudrun and her husband, Augustus Gudmundur the son of Sigurðð, once launched the steel ship.
In the summer of 2009, D18 hf. bought the house, so nothing has been kept since then.
Neighbors say that the condition of the house has deteriorated steadily since, most recently.
On a Facebook page in the neighborhood, one resident says that the house “did not have been particularly lively in the last few years. ”
There may be a number of years in which owners have sought to change the house and the house.
Other neighbors say that the house has not been okay for a long time.
“ It’s a long time to do something decent about this spot, and I’m sorry it’s been so slow. ”
At the same time, he says that he’s upset with the owner of the house because he didn’t drive to finish it, found some common ground with the neighboring house, and stopped this “legislator. ”
"Just do this in consultation with the community around so that it can be done and finished."
The "Legal Step" that the population refers to is the organisational process of the field that has been under way at least since 2017.
Then the owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 requested a permit to build a hill above the current multistorey building and behind the house, a new elevator house, and an annex on one floor, along with a basement.
The building permit granted for that project was submitted to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, and the Committee dropped it from the scope of the project because it did not support the project in the framework of an environmental and resource decision-making process.
Then, in July of the year, a city of smoke started a dispute - organization work and closed it with an advertisement in the Governing News.
That organization was also supported and dropped it from force in March 2020.
At this point, therefore, nearly three years had passed since the initial application for building permits and the owner of the house at the starting point.
At that time, the house had suffered a great deal, and neighbors had grown weary.
When DV asked neighbors about the situation, and neighbors responded in various ways.
Some had an understanding of the intentions of the house owner, others not at all.
Others directed their anger to the city, others not.
Others were just angry, but nothing was necessarily to anyone.
Still others said that the parking lot was tight, but neighbors have a new unused parking lot called Dunhaga 18 - 20 under their vehicle.
One attorney in the case said that he was tired of the administration:
“ Let’s have to go through the process for three times, it’s amazing.
It's like Reykjavik City couldn't read."
Today the house is empty, abandoned, and neglected.
A memory of the hovery landscape of the city’s administration and noble intentions of the owner and many years’ work of those who are now at the start.
When the newspaper was parked in Dunhaga 18, a broad - open door and a pile of junk.
Playstation computers and a recent television were lying around another garbage on the earth — victims of a summer flash.
It was opened into the old university printing office, and there are a lot of cats in the mud.
Clearly, someone has nestled in one corner, but no one is visible.
Letters of couches and beds, and several boards of physical magazines that were likely to become a book, were intrigued.
The entrances of the house were as open as life in both of them.
A reporter was so lucky to run into one of their own people.
There the Romanians were making potato dishes for dinner and invited a journalist in.
The rooms work for Ztrongforce ehf.
They have been there for some time, and D.V. reports that the company paid for nothing but heat and electricity.
Because of the condition of the house, rent is not justified.
From the position of mail in the front door of the house to judge, it is clear that there have been a number of foreign workers in the last miseries.
The operation of the labour market has not been part of the Covid-19 situation, since the contraction in tourism has led to a contraction in the construction sector and these two industries have been the most successful in using the service of the labour market.
Nevertheless, Dunhaga 18 people seemed to have enough work to do and kept the workgallows and wadings in the joint venture to dry after a long working day in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the poor condition of the house, the apartment shared by the boys seemed to be well maintained.
When a journalist asked the boys out of bed, the sarcasm suddenly became clear to him: In the best place in Reykjavik, 1,500 square feet [1,500 square meters] of real estate are being demolished.
Owners want to change the house for the better and their neighbors want to improve the situation while arguing about the definition of 'benefit'.
Between the city's organizational fields, the victim of endless appeal routes and the choice in the organisational process and the floating chains of the decision-making committees on environmental and resource issues are the starting point.
In the house, bedtime workers, perhaps just those who go to improve the situation, live when the Icelandics stop fighting.
The article was originally published in the July 17 issue of DV.
In response to a coronal viral epidemic
Britain’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, will give 10 million pounds in a campaign against overweight, which will include a ban on quick - cut advertising, following a serious illness, partly due to its weight.
It says that Johnson introduces his best - known campaign, tomorrow, Monday, but with the campaign, doctors are encouraged to prescribe bicycle riding for their clients to overweight and, in addition, fight against the proliferation of bicycle rides.
Advertisers on television will be banned by 21 p.m. on the evening, according to reports from the British media.
'COVID-19 has raised us against the short-term and long-term risks of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined that we must use the time to become healthier, more active and eat healthy food,' said the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
Johnson himself has had weight problems, but he was put into intensive care when he was infected with the lemon virus in the spring, and partly because of his weight, he is thought to have become so seriously ill.
Women Are Better to Lead to Change
She said that the new constitution was the greatest step that the nation can take toward greater distribution of power, transparency, and the fight against corruption and the overall benefits.
“We need to change gear a little now, and each person is more likely to make such changes than the community that has easier to be in these values.
They're women," said Helga.
“Women in Iceland are famous for their women’s union.
To stand together and be united in bringing about changes.
So now it's just time for us to lead these changes."
She said that she was a little worried about Iceland’s emphasis as the “best in the world” in both sex content and human rights.
“ Then we’re not as willing to look at what needs to be done.
Like the Germans, they are very conscious of their history and look into everything that needs to be done.
That's a lot.
We need to know where we are coming from and to know the story and listen.
Listen to the voice of the perimeter groups.
We don't all live by the same rules here," said Helga.
On the other hand, she said that women were in a lot of good things in Iceland, but she added that, as in many other places, the Icelandic people lived by enormous masculine values.
She said that politics turned to form its own interests, authority, and power, which were the forces that were in conflict in all communities.
“ Women have now formed this group and come together and have become a little irritated by the fact that Congress will move to look beyond this national quota since 2012, ” she said.
“ It’s this feminine value that we’re thinking about.
From human rights and nature protection, cooperation and the fact that we're all really sitting at the same table," she said, adding that the aforementioned values were the basic values of the new constitution.
“We are a very rich country of naturalism, and it is ridiculous that there are people living in poverty.
It's ridiculous, we can trade differently," said Helga.
“ It’s ridiculous that there is some natural law that women’s jobs are always lower.
It's ridiculous that flight attendants and nurses will have to stand in the battle forever just to get a decent salary."

You can stay in Monet's house for a weekend at a store.
The house, in which Impressionist Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his practice, is now rented on Airbnb.
The next free night in the house is the hall of commerce.
The house is small and cute, located in the town of Givenry in Normandy, France.
From 1883 until his death in 1926, the famous painter lived in the house.
The house has three bedrooms, two living rooms, and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint his famous gardens in this house.
If someone is planning on renting the house, he must rent at least two nights.
Based on page Airbnb, it is next free after week, on Sunday of the shopping weekend, and therefore might be the option for some shoppers on vacation to book the painter’s house.

Tens and a few of them begin to show the symptoms of the disease caused by the coronation virus
Five have been diagnosed with the siron virus domestically during the last three days and most of the infected are unrelated.
Many are infected because of this, and some of them begin to show the symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three were diagnosed with the siron virus domestically yesterday and two at the borderline.
According to a surgeon’s office expert, growing numbers of domestic infections do not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading widely into society.
“ We’ve been segregated from the first internal mutilation, and there’s a virus that hasn’t been seen here before, so we have no particular reason to think it’s gone into society for some time.
This is probably something that has just arrived in the country, but of course we need to be very careful now," said Kamilla Sigri to Josephsdóttir, a specialist in the field of pest control of the county doctor.
Most of them have been infected with aliens.
More than a few who were in contact with the infected are exposed to the symptoms of the corona virus.
“Now there is no influenza and no mention of other respiratory infections, so we can be somewhat liberal in doing these tests on individuals who have found a reason to do something else first,” said Kamilla.
Most of the infection is complete, but there is no possibility that more people will have to suffer from it.
Two of the infected were diagnosed after attending sporting events.
It has raised questions as to whether holding such events can be justified.
The general manager says it is very slow as long as people follow standards and rules.
Kamilla says it is almost impossible for the infected to become infected at the sports conventions.
“ If there is no more isolation from these individuals after associating with them at these sports conventions, we can claim that our conventions have worked.
But it hasn't been revealed," said Kamilla.
The work of the Public Protection Department is under constant review.
“We need to be ready to intervene with further advice or limitations if it seems appropriate,” said Kamilla.
After a week or so, a thousand people will be cleared up to the limit.
This new situation could influence the inclinations.

Conflicts between police and Protestants in Seattle
City authorities in Seattle, Washington, U.S.A., have declared rebellion following widespread protests in the city center.
The police took hold of fires and pepper sprays yesterday to try to clear a large area that Protestants conquered and stretched over many lengths of houses in the vicinity of the city hall.
The police reported on Twitter that at least 11 Protestants had been arrested and that an investigation was being carried out at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of bomb.
The city and police authorities say that Protestants stoned the police with stones, bottles, whale bombs, and other casual ones, and one police officer was taken to a hospital where his injuries were done.
However, the protests in Seattle remained peaceful for a long time.
The blast was for them to demonstrate a consensus between Protestants in Portland, Oregon, where there has been a violent conflict between Protestants and the heavily armed federal police.
There, like in other cities of the United States, people gather under the banners of Black Lives Matter, remember Georges Floyds, who was killed by a Minneapolis police officer on May 25, protests systematic racism in American society and demands compensation.
Not revoked until after receipt of the request
It is not yet clear whether the statements of the flight attendant Icelandair, who will be valid for the next month, will be withdrawn.
An electronic vote on Iceland's airline agreement on behalf of an airline at Icelandair will end at noon tomorrow.
God only Líney’s daughter, president of the Society, assures us that Icelandair will not decide on the statements until the result of the vote is reached.
"It's definitely hanging together," says Godlaud Liney.
“ There have been no cancellations; this must be done so that human engines can be found.
And of course, people are untiring to know if they'll have a job after the month."
The price is for a contract signed a week ago, on the night of July 19th.
It is assumed to be valid until the end of September 2025 and is based on a contract that had previously been awarded by flight crews.
On July 17th, the Management Board and the Icelandic Air Traffic Management Board agreed to announce a comprehensive cease-fire at Icelandair, which was approved by the members of the team in a vote.
It never came to her, but this was decided following the decision of Icelandair to discontinue discussions with the Air Traffic Management Company, cancel all his girlfriends and look for contracts with another trade union.
At that time, the pilots of the company were to take on the work of insidious forces on board temporarily.
Asking how she thinks the vote will go, Godlaud Liney says it is hard to say.
“People are wounded by this move to Icelandair, when all the airlines of the company were denounced and announced that they would be agreed with another union.
It turns out that it's an effect," she says.
940 flight attendants worked at Icelandair at the end of April, where 900 of them, about 95%, were terminated.
Their release is diverse: he is three months with him that hath the shortest office, and ends it at the juli-august of the month.
That group includes about 90% of aviation girls in Icelandair.
What will the contract not be approved?
“ Then we wish to continue our discussions with our fellow students.
With this deal, we're meeting Icelandair's requirements.
If he is rejected, it is clear that the ladies of the air have gone too far."
A vote on a nuclear agreement ends and Icelandair announces a second quarter of a year tomorrow
A new agreement will end at noon tomorrow.
Source Icelandair for a second quarter will also be published tomorrow, but preliminary results suggest that the company’s income has decreased by 85 percent from the same period last year.
An electrical vote on the agreement between the Icelandic Aviation Association and the Icelandic Association for Employment started on Wednesday, July 22, and ends tomorrow, on Monday, July 27, at noon.
Those who vote for the deal are Icelandair employees who pay social contributions to the Aviation Company.
Icelandair and FFI signed a new nuclear agreement on Sunday, July 19, but on Friday before, Icelandair had broken discussions with the partner after the flight attendants had concluded a previous agreement on a vote at the beginning of July.
At that time, Icelandair had told all the airlines and airlines of the company on Friday, but they were pulled back after a new nuclear agreement was signed.
According to a new agreement, airplanes need to fly more than five hours a month before the same basic fee.
The treaty dates back to 2025, where pilots have been brought together to fly for how long to fly on one watch.
During a meeting at the Hilton Nordica Hotel last Monday, the agreement was presented to FFI’s associates, describing many flight habits that were discussed by a news agency about their dissatisfaction with the contract.
Most, however, seemed to agree that the agreement would have to be approved in order to keep the FIFI alive.
Icelandair's revenue for a second quarter will be presented tomorrow than the EBIT of the company, its operating income for the financial sector and taxes, is negative in terms of preliminary export results of between 100 and 110 million U.S. dollars or about 15 billion U.S. dollars.
Icelandair sent preliminary calculations to the Kauphällen last Wednesday, saying that the company’s income was about $60 million in the quarter or $8 billion.
At the end of the quarter, about a billion dollars have been spent by some 154 million U.S. dollars.
Icelandair also aims to offer the company’s shares in August.
Icelandair aims to conclude negotiations with the 15 creditors, the government and the Boeing aircraft manufacturer by the end of a month before the partial air traffic services are launched.
New variant rather than new type of virus
“ A new virus simply means that it has been an individual who came from abroad.
It's not something that's been grinding here domestically," says Már Kristjánsson, chief physician at the National Hospital's infectious disease department, who reports that "a new type of virus" has been detected here in the country.
Three domestic outbreaks were detected yesterday and two at the border.
One who was diagnosed had participated in the social work of a sports association at the Rey Cup soccer convention, but the source of the infection is unknown and infectious.
In addition, infection was detected in a person who came to the country on July 15 and there are two who were in association with it began to show the symptoms of COVID-19.
In this case, infection was detected in yesterday’s related infection reported in the previous day and after sequencing in an Icelandic genetic analysis, “new undetected virus. ”
Infection is complete in connection with this infection.
It is noted that there is no new virus but the same virus that has spread worldwide, i.e. the new coronal SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is more appropriate to talk about a new variant of that virus than about a new type of virus.
Asking what that means and whether it could say anything to the beginning of another wave of the epidemic, Már says that as there is a single incident, there could be no more to it.
“However, if there are cases of non-related domestic origin that have the same genetic characteristics as this particular variant, that conclusion [after a second wave] could be reached, but it is not timely to do so,” explains Már.
My goodness in the hot tub.
Is the secret to the happiness of Iceland hidden in the hot tubs?
The BBC’s organizers lead to the likeness of a fun video that sheds light on the pool and hotspot culture of the country.
The Icelandic bath culture is unique worldwide, and it is claimed that nowhere in the world is there as many baths as there are in every country.
The natural soil is at the root of it, but it is also the standard for the soiling that prevails here.
Children’s divorce was legal in 1940, but older citizens are still able to use hot water for their health.
Dizziness is described as a fixed part of the general well - being of the country.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of class and position.
According to the mobile phones, people talk together in personal notes about the home and space or enjoy the graceful power of the water: thoughts and loads of batteries of the soul and body.
Should the bar pick up a hundred days in the election
There are hundreds of days until the United States goes to the elections and chooses presidents until four years of age.
Donald Trump is looking for re-election, but he has to go to the stable.
Joe Biden, the prospective candidate of the Democratic Party, has a great advantage over Trump on a national level, taking into account the polls.
According to a recent AP News Review, the United States has a record that the nation is in the wrong direction.
Similarly, Trump’s pandemic reaction to the new coronin virus is very unpopular, and in addition, more Americans believe that the president has been holding economic affairs badly before.
More specifically, only two out of every ten Americans say that the United States is on the right track.
32 percent say they support Trump’s reaction to the epidemic, and 48 percent say he has kept things well.
In March it was 56 percent, and in January it was 67 percent.
According to the mean FiveTirtyEight, Biden is 49.9 percent nationally followed by Trump 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to draw attention from his approach to the epidemic to Biden, to promote so - called cultural discourses, and to proclaim policies that should turn to law and order.
Biden’s presentation, however, makes a great effort to keep Trump’s attention focused on the possibility of winning bets if the election really revolves around what Trump has done in the last four years.
It also seems that unpopular Trump is planning to attack the members of the Republic Party and fear that even the majority of the U.S. Senate elders who have been very excited here could be reached by Democrats.
Politico told us on the days of keeping close to groups and suppliers, and that is now what the Republic group would have its greatest appetite for decades.
There has been a particularly bad area in the 2016 Congressional Elections, and it is now clear that this trend will continue.
Trump, in recent days, has tried to scare the inhabitants of the suburbs into following him, including by saying that he will be President Biden, he will destroy the U.S. suburbs and promote racial strife.
Among other things, Trump has dropped a rule from Barack Obama’s time in the White House, which was designed to increase the diversity of the suburbs.
Then he encouraged the “housewives ” of the U.S. branch to read an article by former assistant director of New York, claiming that Biden would destroy the U.S. suburbs and accepted Trump.
“ The waiting will destroy your neighborhoods and your American dream.
I will keep it, and even do it even better!" said the President.
The people of the United States are an ever - increasing group of voters.
According to NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.
Ever since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of this group’s votes has become president.
Except in 2012 when Mitt Romney received a majority vote from this group but lost to Barack Obama.
Surveys have shown that despite the fact that Trump secured the small majority in the suburbs in 2016, his follow-up there has been significantly reduced.
Although there are differences between the probes, Biden has measured about fifteen percentiles of Trump’s premise in the excursions recently.

Will Olympic Fire Be Light at the End of the Gangs?
After a final decision was made to postpone the Olympic Games, an event that only world wars have brought up to date, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the Olympics would be famous as “the light at the end of the corridors, ” likely pointing to a world - age corona virus that the world is now going through in unity.
Africans have years more to prepare, and Japanese authorities are adding costs to the delay.
Everyone, however, keeps their heads busy.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the scene of the Olympic Games this year, the cheers of Japanese representatives were genuine.
They cried and laughed alternately, for Tokyo had sought to keep the games in 2016, but it was a time lower than Rio in Brazil.
This time, Tokyo City and Japan would bathe in the attention of the world.
The games were scheduled to take place from July 24 to August 9, but have been postponed for a year, beginning on July 23, 2021, and ending on August 8.
If the games are not held then, if the flag is still too dangerous, the games will be aborted.
Yet, no one wants to think that way to the end.
Olympics are no ordinary sports competition.
Nothing is saved, the show should always be amazing and strive to top the last game.
The city of Olympics is chosen on the basis of a election committee’s assessment of the city’s presentations.
The grander the presentation — the more likely it is to be made.
Tokyo spent $150 million trying to win the 2016 Olympics, or more than $20 billion.
The second time, when the 2020 Games were applied for, $75 million, about $1 billion, were put in the presentation.
In 2013, when Tokyo was decided to receive the games this year, the Japanese authorities had a budget of $30 billion.
However, that amount is just a drop in the ocean, depending on how much it takes to build Olympic villages, playgrounds, and, in general, to strengthen the land’s interior to cope with such conventions, to prepare them, and to keep the games themselves.
Organizers in Japan have said that the Tokyo Olympic Games, which were scheduled to run these days but have been postponed for one year because of the coronation virus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
However, a report by a government correspondent in Japan, published at the end of the last year, revealed that the cost was more than double that.
The cost of delaying games may not be fully assessed, but it has been estimated that it may cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the initial cost.
So the total cost to the Japanese Olympic Committee, and Japanese taxpayers could run from 15 to 30 billion dollars.
There are so high figures that all the tax revenues of the Icelandic State were only spent on nearly half of the Olympic Games, at the lowest possible cost.
The Olympic Games are an event of the magnitude that they have often become the subject of economics, who try to test numbers and see the benefits and benefits of the games.
In the short run, it seems that many people have come to the conclusion that the effects of the Olympic Games are less positive for the economy of the cities that hold them.
For example, there is a high - to - a - short increase in employment, but for a longer time, cities tend to be in debt and threatened with the cost of small - scale human labor.
Rio, Brazil, has been heavily indebted for the 2016 games and has been in trouble with maintaining all the major sporting activities built for the games.
There have been figures from the 2012 London Games, which show that only 10 percent of those who received a job related to the Olympic Games in the city were previously unemployed.
This means that no new jobs were involved except in a small way.
In general, cities have not been particularly successful in holding the Olympic Games financially because of the slender cost of the civil engineering works that are built up for the games.
However, the benefits are often considered to include increased traffic from tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities after the games, which are, however, very uncertain about the 2021 games.
Also, it is not certain whether you will have to receive all the number of spectators who usually pick up the games.
The main thing, though, is the honor that the cities are given to be chosen, but it is difficult to appreciate the value of money.
In spite of the enormous cost, it may also be said that the joy that the games bring is not that the prize can be placed on it.
Of course, although the show is often magnificent, and there is nowhere to save, it is not just about money.
It's the athletes in the foreground.
To some successful people, it is only a surprise to delay the games.
For example, in his article on the Olympic Games, Chloe Esposito, the Australian five - year - old and gold winner, Chloe Esposito, is a Catholic and would have been far more fun for summer than would have hoped to be in a 2021 race form.
So it is among those athletes who are just rather happy with the postponement, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who planned to quit after the games this year, they would have been held at the right time, meaning in some cases the suspension of the games before the games took place.
Simply do not trust your body to go through years of vigorous exercise.
In the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio, as well as in Simone Biles, only a few athletes made their appearance in the heart of the audience.
She came home with four gold around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has attended several interviews in his home country of the United States recently to discuss the Olympics.
She's going to play 2021, but she's definitely not sure she's still at the top of the games next year, which is when she's 24 years old.
Although it is generally not considered to be a tall age, it is in the highest order for a gymnast in the front row.
“This is a sensitive issue,” says Biles, but smiles in another interview published on the Instagram page of the Olympic Committee, asking if she is going to get as far as 2021 and she did in Rio 2016.
“ I just don’t know if I’ll be on top for another year, ” says Biles.
She has previously said that her body does not tolerate the stress of gymnastics for much longer.
Still, it is a forceful practice for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles admits that it has been a uncomfortable feeling to suddenly stop practicing when the pandemic stood as high and the gym was closed.
There were no exceptions for Biles rather than others during the seven weeks of closure of all sports activities.
All her Olympic gold would not be able to buy access beyond the others, and she would have to find ways to stay in the shape of others.
Certainly, the basic form is a little better than that of most people.
“We have a tight schedule now.
It was hard to start rehearsing first after the gym opened.
We started slowly, but we're back on track, and I'm going to increase my rehearsals steadily as the year passes.
Of course, we do not know exactly what these games will be like or whether they will be held, but we do practice according to their future, and that is all we can do.
I've put too much effort into leaving the sport now," says Biles.
With it, as with others, there is a lack of doubt or perhaps a greater awareness that the situation may reveal that the games will not be held at all in 2021.
However, predicting that is hopeless.
In July 2021, no one can know what the situation in the cancer virus will be like but to prepare for the Olympics in view of being held in the year.
Maybe Olympic fire will be the light at the end of the Covid canals.
Delayed Marriage for Episode
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone his wedding because of the Crown Virus.
She was to marry the ex-Bachelorette champion Wells Adams this summer.
“I think it’s other more important things to think about right now,” said the actress in conversation with the People.
“ We’d like to get married sometime and have the dream wedding and have all the people who love us.
But we decided to delay and focus on what is important now, and it is helping to share information about the importance of wearing masks and staying at home.
I look at more world affairs than weddings these days.
There are many things going on and we should focus our attention on what is happening in the world."
