Triumph of the right-wing populists in Austria, total they come to 29 percent
A marked weakening of both parties of the previous great coalition and a clear strengthening of the right-wing populist parties brought after the first preliminary results the preferred parliamentary elections from Sunday in Austria.
In particular, the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered losses where the position of former Chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the Kippe.
In contrast, the electoral leader of the alliance for the future of Austria (BZÖ), Kärntner Landeshauptmann Jörg Haider, prepares for a triumphal return to federal politics.
According to the results so far, social democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest in the country with 29.8 percent of the votes, but against the last elections in 2006, it loses 5.5 percent of the votes.
Even worse, the ÖVP cut off, which loses almost nine percent of the votes by 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the post-war history of Austria, and especially of the People's Party, which had demanded the preferred elections, this is a truly disastrous result.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP had resigned from the coalition, the People's Party had a clear lead ahead of the SPÖ.
The voters, however, probably punished the party for failing the government.
Already in the first reactions to the results there were speculations about the possible resignation of the party chairman and former Vice Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could already be the case on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party board.
Such a development would probably pave the way to the most likely way out of the electoral debacle, i.e. to renew the great coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Freedom Party (FPÖ) received 18 percent preliminary, the BZÖ eleven percent of the votes - the Social Democrats expressed their fears at the same time that the year 1999 could repeat when the People's Party had agreed with the populist parties (at that time the FPÖ was still uniform, in 2005 it had split off from the BZÖ) with regard to a common government, which even caused sanctions on the part of the European Union.
Jörg Haider, who has already declared that he is willing to cooperate with each party, is obviously putting up with this development, and from a return to Vienna to Austria's federal policy.
The Green Party also moved into Parliament, but suffered slight losses and, among the Austrian political parties, dropped from the third to the fifth place.
No other party has probably mastered the four-percent-thürde and, as a result, did not enter Parliament either.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool off
If it is not possible to solve the problem with the Czech scientists charged in India because of the illegal collection of bugs, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg believes that there could be some cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
This was emphasized by the minister in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this is not clear, then sure, there will be some cooling," he explained after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks, in judicial matters the executive could only be difficult to intervene.
In spite of all, he argued that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted from the charge and received a fine of money, the central government wanted with the local government in Dardjiling, in whose case the case falls.
"His problem could be solved," said the minister.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years imprisonment, it would be best for Mukherdshi to be tried at a higher court.
He could thus ask for release for bail and freely wait for his verdict, says the minister.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had also spoken in the course of negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then a pardon would be in question for him," said the head of the Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to suggest the condemned "competent legal support" was by the Indian minister.
At the same time, he said that such help would already be offered to them by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India that have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also admit that," Schwarzenberg added.
At the same time, according to the Czech press agency ČTK, in front of his partner, he confirmed the Czech Republic's importance in the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really think it's a big mistake to arrest and accuse these Czech scientists," he said.
An answer to the question as to whether the Indian side had given the undertaking to deal with the matter, the minister declined.
"I've already been promised quite a lot," he only said.
A Czech judge over the ringing around the seabed
It appears on an electronic map on which Australia and the adjacent sea areas are depicted.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with it also the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself," said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is one of the thirty-member staff of the UN Division for Oceans and Sea Rights.
His head, the Division Director, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and supplements it.
Work and enthusiasm prevail here.
So far, the seabed contains a little known world, rich in natural sources.
Here oil can be found, further ore and other non-regenerative raw materials, but also previously unknown living organisms that carry the key to developing a medicine against cancer.
A seabed larger than the mainland
Today, the Anrain states submitted their claim to the new seas.
After a UN convention, they make use of their rights, which they agreed on in Montego Bay in Jamaica in 1982.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches up to a few hundred kilometres from the shore of a country to the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive right to all sources of the continental shelf.
"Simplified as a continental shelf is considered the part of the seabed and its soles, which represents a natural continuation of the continent below the surface of the sea.
It crosses the shores of the sea, often the border of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," Mikulka explains.
The request submitted by the Commission's country to establish the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by a comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on many cost-intensive studies and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical technical support.
The Commission has so far been negotiating over five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the three latter countries have succeeded," Mikulka adds.
A recent international echo was the success of Australia, which was the first country to be able to significantly increase its sea areas.
But also New Zealand is a winner - the expansion of the sea floor, which was approved by the Commission last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometres, i.e. about six times the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigations.
The profit that will flow to them in the future from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, have an invaluable value.
Further countries will also gradually submit their applications.
You can do this for ten years from the moment they ratify the Montego Bay Agreement.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor begins, which is called by the convention "common heritage of humanity".
No state has any special position here.
The right to promote in this field shall be granted to an international institution established by the Convention.
"The bottom of the sea is not a gold pit," says Director Mikulka with some exaggeration, adding that "the individual areas are legally defined and the system is contractually anchored".
Czechs in the Pacific
A part of the sea floor is now also part of the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern bloc as part of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991 it received the status of a so-called "rail-breaking investor" under the Convention, as did the investors of a number of other countries.
The organization has the right to promote in the Pacific ClarionClipperton zone between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be surveyed by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is divided there, it is a kind of tatra on the seabed.
"Federal can be funded there on an area of 75 000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich site of polymetal concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese", says another lawyer, Indian Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the Rober Sandev division brings such a concretion as a pattern.
It reminds of a small potato or, with a little imagination, of the illustrious shame that the legend after the golem has brought to life.
German Special Forces were on site for hostage liberation
The Egyptian government had requested assistance from Germany to resolve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special units were ready, but they were not used.
More and more details are being known about the circumstances of 11 European tourists kidnapped in Egypt.
According to the Ministry of Defence and Interior, the rescue operation involved German special forces indirectly.
Thus, both specialists of the Bundeswehr and GSG 9 officials were the Fliegerstaffel of the Bundespolizei, the Bundescriminalamt, as well as logistics experts of the Technical Aid Office at the site of liberation.
However, as ministers announced on Monday evening, the German forces were not needed because the hostages ran and fled when they recognized signs of a violent liberation.
The Egyptian government had adopted the aid offered by Germany to involve it as local support forces.
"Happyly," said one of the spokespersons of the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers had kidnapped the group of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions on September 19, in the south of Egypt.
After the abduction in a desert region in southern Egypt, the hostages had been dragged to and fro in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of hostages remained unclear until the end as well as the details of the liberation or possible ransom payments.
The rescuers have now arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the liberated hostages were in the care of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
There was no information in Berlin at first when they returned to Germany.
According to the "Picture" magazine, the five holidaymakers and the Special Forces are scheduled to fly out with an Airbus of the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
US Representative House Refused Rescue Package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has almost failed the 700 billion dollar rescue package for financial markets.
The Dow Jones rushed to the depths.
With 206 to 227 votes, the US representative house has rejected the government's rescue package for financial markets.
Despite all the appeals of U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties, there was no majority in favour of the program with which the chaos should be curbed in the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the supporters had desperately tried to convince the critics of the 700 billion dollar package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, had called on Members to vote in favour, even if the plan was unpopular.
"It's hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn't happened yet," he admitted.
In the course of the vote, the Dow Jones broke in by more than six percent or 600 points.
The reason was investors' concerns that the state rescue package could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, then, after becoming aware of the failure, to rescind.
Experts now expect further severe turbulence on international financial markets.
The approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is necessary for the programme to enter into force.
Organizers record increasing booking rates
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
In travel bookings for the coming months, sales increased significantly compared to the previous year according to a study - even more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic prospects, the Germans’ desire for travel remains unscathed.
When booking for the winter season, the rice offices recorded a sales increase of 31 percent compared to the same period of the previous year, as the German Travel Association (DRV) announced on Monday in Berlin.
According to the study by the market research institute GfK, there are already increased booking figures for the autumn months.
Thus, the revenues of the travel agencies for October amounted to around 11 percent compared to 2007, the DRV announced.
The basis for these results is numbers of GfK, which evaluates monthly booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and calculates them for the entire market.
Travel bookings were recorded until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar rate, travel to the United States was particularly required, the DRV announced.
Here the booking growth was around one third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the local population of the Germans, are particularly sought-after destinations.
In particular, vacation tours are high in the course, said DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising cost of energy and food, the costs "are better calculated for customers than for individually organised holidays".
Money could save consumers, among other things, through early book discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months had also been very well booked, so that there would be a surplus of sales over the previous year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who made a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time Octoberfest
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-Hits in the Endless loop, beer from Liter-Krügen and promis in Designer-Dirndln.
A Wiesn debut.
Susanne Kronsucker and I actually don't have much in common.
She's blond, television moderator and wears a tailor-made Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is second hand.
But one thing connects us: Within three minutes on the meadow, the photographers are already falling upon us and cutting the memory cards full - very flattering and that on my first visit to the meadow.
That's how you make friends.
The Cheap-Dirndl seems to fulfill its purpose.
When Wiesn-Touri and actually located north of the white string stencil, the feeling of well-being remained in the costume to date.
But once on the Theresienwiese, everything is half as bad.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or leather pants; no one looks reckless or embarrassingly touched - all completely normal.
Odd views at the chocolate banana stand only reap my Dirndl aprons.
A Munich woman draws my attention to the fact that I had incorrectly bound the apron: "Left hoast free, middle virgin, right forgiven, back wetwet."
Secretly, I cut the loop from the back to the left.
"Vest," said it and laughed.
Others make less effort on subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felt hats, on which "To drink to get dressed!" stands and extends to an unspoiled naked buttock.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitude is Bob, who comes from England and also attends the October Festival for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a long drawn "oooo".
He will tell me that after he has finished his previously drunken measure.
Right next to one of those hydrants, everyone thinks he's a garbage dumpster.
So Bob is one of those infamous "Wildbiesler".
Others are not fortunate to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At eight o'clock in the evening, paramedics in crowds run over the festivities that need to take care of the poor swallows.
The nurses always appear in the pack - always four at a time drag a covered suit from tent to tent.
It works like most grass visitors: empty down, full back.
Whoever's in the promille sarge under the plane, you can't see.
"These are the ones where goarnegers pack," one of the paramedics called to me on request and disappeared in the mud.
Name of the accident victim reported by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in the hospital after she was driven by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, who lives at Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city center.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but died later.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested for suspecting driving lightly.
In the meantime, he was released on bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in entering Turkey's hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, is one of the finest relics of this failed imperial quest.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-renaissance style.
At least that's what the guide tells you.
The building sits riding at the end of the platform with a tower on every corner of the front and thus looks like any provincial German town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building is falling apart.
But once you're inside the curved ticket switch, there's no doubt about the grandeur of the project, whose western access was that.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Bagdad Society.
Germany, which was a late-traveler in the imperialist game, had before implementing its ambitions to dominate the Middle East, by means of a train connection to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, Germany's imperialist project was paralysed during World War I.
His rails were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, created by the insurmountable limits of the cold war, has disappeared.
British forces moved out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there were also bad news for the Hyderpasha train station.
In 1917 a ammunition train flew into the air, where the artful roof was destroyed.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then it has slowly decayed, far away from history.
Today, however, this railway line serves, at least symbolically, as a gateway to Anatolia and all the east of it to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of the Tükei.
The ruling Judicial and Development Party, the ACP, has introduced a bold new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the neighbouring regions, created by the boundaries of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a policy of rapprochement.
Remarkably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the key dates of this new foreign policy, I have taken the night train to Ankara, the capital of Turkey, to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the ACP, the Turkish MEP Suat Kiniglioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a bumpy ride on tracks that produced the same pace of the old world in the famous documentation "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is considered a new city, for the new worldly state project to turn the Ottoman past back.
However, the ACP, known for its Islamic roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish unity
This has caused some mistrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi has taken me to the headquarters of the AKP, a specially manufactured, ultra-modern stone and steel construction, in a developing suburb surrounded by half-finished shopping malls and pubs where middle managers in suits, both men and women, met to complete the first shops of the day.
Suat Kiniglioglu could be a middle-right politician of almost any other political party in Europe.
Dress up, tie, I'm sure he even packed a blackberry.
"The purpose of the party's foreign policy is now to integrate Turkey with its immediate neighbouring countries.
The Cold War was an exception," he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from its hinterland.
Today, she has to look east and west at the same time.
There wouldn't be either one or the other.
She'd have to do both.
"But surely Turkey could someday," I asked, "be forced to decide?"
"Turkish," he said, "wouldn't have to make this decision."
He then pointed out a point that almost everyone with whom I was speaking almost routinely stated: Turkey's relations, not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are just as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be able to drive Europe as a whole on just rail east towards Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha's train station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German powers, Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had watched the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised she would have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now, to a large extent, be in Turkey's hands.
And when I was waiting for the ferry that was supposed to bring me back over the Bosporus, I remembered that Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe" in those days.
At least at that time, there did not seem to be much doubt as to which continent should have a claim on this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Choir "Tod" Handley (after 11 September).
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
He was meant for young people up to 21 years old, but when the 1979 choir was singing for the last time, some of us were already at the end of 20 - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological form changer) stood for the readiness and ability of the choir to attack any piece of music presented to him, whether it was a Madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a cappella or with a full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young chores was often astonishing, always exciting and lasting only thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that never went down for years.
How often did death stop us from "letting the music speak for itself".
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in music.
So sing it!"
His way of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never gentlemany, but never superfluous.
No matter how high the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor had been beaten to the knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, in which he led the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the last 40 years, I have written reviews for over a hundred of his concerts and I can honestly say that I was never disappointed by a single one - often I was inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of size and personal modesty.
He abhors the conductors who, according to his words, simply "goed home with one or two known hosts in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your call for William Woodruff (September 25) you write that "he again took over the teaching of economic history in Oxford in 1946 and in 1950 received a Houblon-Norman research scholarship ... while he studied for a BSc, a MA and a doctorate at the same time.
This is a conclusion from an author's remark in Woodruff's book "Jensees von Nab End", but it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham and during that time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, who was later published in 1958 as the British rubber industry.
He was born in 1950-1951 in the United States in the course of a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It's not known why Woodruff wanted to hide this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
`I recommend the exhibition by José Vicente Resino `Flamenco and Leben', because his photographs are fantastic in black and white, in documentary style.
They drew my attention to them because of their simplicity and because of the power they radiated, as they always treat the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows many feelings.
Resino knows how to find the magic moments.'
Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November, Honda starts marketing the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While his predecessor model had a large interior, this large room limo offers a much larger one.
In addition, there are also the technical finenesses that allow even more comfortable driving and saving gasoline.
Changes prior to the impending revolution.
So is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically speaking, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes that have been made in this big limo are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new room flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics should be emphasized.
However, before you start analysing the new model, you have to say that this new jazz appears six years later, after the first generation has appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda managed to renew this model for a shorter time compared to the other manufacturers.
Although the Honda Jazz in Europe is less known, this model is a phenomenon that affects its sales in other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where jazz is the best-selling car of the year 2002 and also in the course of this year 2008.
After jazz appeared on the market, about one million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second sales market was the old continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda tries to increase the sale of the new jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese companies sold a total of 83 000 jazz models in 2007, the expected estimates are 10 000 cars, which is 17% of the expected growth on the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has since 2002 sold a total of 8 000 jazz models, which is 6.7 % of total Honda sales in Spain.
As for the new generation of the model, the heads of the branch in Spain expect to be able to sell 2,000 jazz models per year.
More precisely, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model allows the sale reduction to be hidden in Spain.
In reality, the leaders of the brand hope to complete the year with a total sale of 22,000 models, which is 4 000 cars less than in 2007, a 16% reduction.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain to 1.8% compared to the previous year.
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
In order to achieve this share, Honda relies on the appearance of a new model.
It is insight, a hybrid car with 5 doors and compact size of 4.7 meters in length, the Japanese company hopes to sell around 200 000 models a year all over the world.
According to the Japanese manufacturer's market estimates, 50 % of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remaining share is distributed across the old continent and Japan.
The publication of Insight on the market is planned for the first months of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in Valencia in January.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz is growing in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, which leads to the assumption that it has become 5 centimeters larger.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Together with the increase in dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new spatial flexibility programme and, on the other hand, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution that was also used in the previous jazz model.
The capacity of the trunk, which has a double loading area system, also reaches up to 339 litres, i.e. 19 litres larger than the capacity of the first generation trunk.
It must be stressed that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4 litre petrol engine, because the capacity of the trunk of the Honda Jazz with a 1.2-litre gasoline engine is 379 litres.
Among other improvements, except for the additional equipment elements such as leather seats or the possibility of panoramic windows, improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the back doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz having only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 versions of the petrol engines: 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which allows low fuel consumption and smaller CO2 emissions, excellent technical performance and simultaneously provides torque-intensive power for the entire engine run time.
The first variant with 1.2 liters achieves the power of 90 hp at 6 000 revolutions with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 min?1 .
This petrol engine - the predecessor model of Jazz reaches 78 PS - has 5.3 litres of petrol consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the previous engine, which reached 83 hp in the previous generation, he now manages to reach 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5.4 litres of petrol consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
`Auto-Biene', which avoids collisions
To advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired by nature this time, more precisely, by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight is due to the swarm behaviour of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic car robot drive or BR23C and represents the first step in accident prevention technologies.
The engineers from the technical development center of the Nissan Motor Co. have developed these small robots in cooperation with the research center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Head of Technology-PR and R&D-Brand Management, the BR23C represents an extension of the four-layer Nissan security shield.
This robot is intended to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval airspace, which is very similar to the Nissan safety sign.
But the most important thing is the facet eyes of the bees, which can see through an angle of 300 degrees in all directions, allowing them to fly undisturbed in their personal airspace without interruption.
In order to replicate the round perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
It notices obstacles which are located at a distance of up to two metres in front of the BR23C and in a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance up to the object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor, which is immediately translated into a signal for avoiding the collision.
`At the moment when obstacle is noticed, the small robot will imitate the bee flight and immediately change direction by turning his wheels around 90o or even larger angles to avoid the collision.
The biggest difference to other arbitrary systems is that this deviation is absolutely instinctive.
If this were not the case, the robot could not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles,' explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of the Laboratory for Mobility and the leading engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot can neither deviate upwards nor downwards, but can not overlap; he can only move on two dimensions and in the direction that allows him to turn his wheels and not in the infinite directions and in the infinite way that the bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and braking functions to prevent the collisions of the small robot.
`This device only needs every few seconds to process the information and act upon this information.
It does not require either the information or the intuitive logic of the manoeuvres made, so it can work continuously with just a few dozen KB of the disk space.
This sounds surprising, but it's not about the GBs and not even about the MBs of the storage space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan will introduce in the series cars over the next ten years.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and longer than a variety of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system through satellite, in order to lead up to the target while driving, avoiding obstacles on the way.
She's trembling before she's charged with a mortgage.
One has to realize that the US Treasury, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide support, is not in the best interests.
Before the crisis and to avoid the US citizens becoming involved in mortgage history of supposedly paying banks, an entertaining and informative game was developed for the Internet surfers: `Bad Credit Hotel', it says.
Or maybe, the 'hotel of bad loans' or the mess.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think one, two and up to three times whether it is the moment to ask for no credit.
And especially where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
Of course it has useful information, but without details.
This is more a page for teenagers than a place for all spectators.
What will happen when the game is expanded?
Well, when a dreamy room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house.
Morgan Stanley provides her capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into her company, which would be the first bank in Japan to spend nine billion dollars and so take 21% of its capital, an innovation that is due to a strong fall in its stock exchange rate.
One week after a preliminary agreement had been made public, the two banks stated that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s staff at a uniform price of $25.25, resulting in a total sum of three billion dollars.
The assumed price is less than 19% of the share's price of August 31.
MUFG will invest an additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will secure it a profit of 10% and can be resold at a price of 31,25 dollars.
Morgan Stanley explained that the global business will be conducted on the basis of a uniform average price of 29 dollars, i.e. 28% above the current price value.
The Morgan Stanley share, however, fell by 6.79% against 17.00 GMT to 23.07 dollars.
'This strategic link represents an important opportunity to accelerate the transition from Morgan Stanley to the status of a holding bank', said John Mack, Director General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley has adopted this status last week, which should enable him to expand his business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Their connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the largest names of Wall Street to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before.
The arrangements presented on Monday also show that the agreement was changed over the last few days: Last Monday Morgan had simply explained that she would sell up to 20% of her shares for about 8.5 billion dollars to Japan.
`A week ago', in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG, we thought that participation would consist entirely of common shares.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and secure ourselves.
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below its price value for Morgan Stanley shares.
And the business will go with a reduction of profit by about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential shares into common shares in one year, if the latter are exchanged at more than 50% above the sale value within a given period, i.e. at approximately 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley assures that the money delivered by MUFG will enable him to use investment opportunities, strengthen their balance sheet and increase their sales.
A press spokesperson of the group, however, refused to provide more detailed information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be able to book a payment ability ratio of around 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan explained that since the end of August he had 'clearly' reduced his balance sheet.
The last few weeks were hard for the group who had to look at how their stock exchange price dropped by half, while the price for insurance against incapacity went up.
This price went back on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other 'survivors' of the major investment banks on Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced last week, 15 billion dollars, partly at Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
The Republic around the socialism of the 21st century is re-founded.
This is the joint project of Venezolaner Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Equatorialian Rafael Correa.
The third person who followed the example of his like-minded and friends this Sunday was the plan of a new constitution.
Mission fulfilled, because according to the public results of 80% of voters, 64% voted 'Yes' in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% agreed with 'No', 7% of the ballots were invalid and 0.7% were empty.
In order for the constitutional project to be adopted, one vote must be achieved in more than half of all votes cast.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the end of the polls and a census of a non-governmental organisation had announced a clear victory for 'Yes', and they predicted 63% to 70%.
By the way, during the night from Sunday to Monday, Rafael Correa had demanded the victory of his constitutional project.
The 'Constitution has triumphed in an overwhelming way', he had assured Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 kilometers southwest of Quito, and congratulated the Equatarians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean like-minded Michelle Bachelor.
The election, held in silence in accordance with the OAS, was a 444-point text to secure the 'new socialism' for which the President is committed.
The Constitutional Project transfers the state power to the economy by leaving it with the sole right to 'development planning' in a country that lives as far as possible from the promotion of oil by foreign companies and from foreign currencies that send emigrators to the country.
The project, driven forward by Correa, which was elected in 2006, will also allow the head of state to exercise more comprehensive power, which will be able to exercise up to two successive mandates of four years each, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa already announced that he would use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also guarantees the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already begun to introduce in this country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population live below the poverty line.
In the end, she also envisages banning the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an Equatorial base as a base for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were liberated in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions, who had been captured ten days ago.
You're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held in the desert for eleven days, were brought back to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they were liberated from an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages reached the military base al-Maza right next to Cairo International Airport at 15.30 a.m. on board a special aircraft.
They were taken directly, without speaking to the press, on board a helicopter to the hospital of Maadi, a foreign district of Cairo, to be investigated there.
They enjoy all 'best health' and the kidnappers 'were not paid ransom', explained Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna on the Roll Field.
After being captured on September 19 at an off-road car safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was again and again taken from a hiding place by 35 unknown deportees.
They are eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and also eight Egyptians: two leaders, four chauffeurs, one border guard and the director of the agency Aegypus, organizer of Safari.
An Egyptian security officer explained that 30 members of the special units, from board two helicopters, started the attack at night shortly before dawn.
`On both sides shots and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest of them fled', said this responsible one who wants to remain anonymous.
He explained that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special units had been sent to Sudan, where they received support through German and Italian commands.
The head of the Italian diplomat Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade, where he is currently located, about the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special units.
'We must acknowledge that thanks to the professionalism and performance of our men, we have achieved this result from the secret service and the special units', he explained without further details.
He also argues that a ransom had been paid.
On the eve of the night, the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped an off-road patrol, in which the kidnappers were found killing six of them, including the leader of Chad, and two arrests.
The army declared that they were linked to a group of rebels from Darfour, the Libération du Soudan-Unité movement (SLA-U), which however immediately contradicts this movement.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and is a central theme of the current election campaign.
The better.
But one area of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will stand up and denounce the pitiful sums that are granted to the small museums, the archives, the archaeological excavations or the national historical sites that starve to death?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government that they neglect their monuments and their culturally important buildings?
That there are no right laws in Quebec, as in Canada, that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government only provides EUR 3.5 million for the restoration of the castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
With our American neighbours, the Constitution of their country states that the protection of the cultural heritage belongs to the culture of the American, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all Members and all governmental districts, in mutual agreement.
In Quebec, in the association of the historical societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 honorary officials gathered in 211 historical societies are working hard to deal with history, save with a few large ones the numerous private archives, and preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage who protest with the power of despair when sponsors and decision-makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux Governments Governments Governments of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalization, the Benelux states want to take advantage of the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank, which has been hit by the US financial crisis in turbulence: the three states provide EUR 11.2 billion to the bank and insurance institution, which, by the way, also has branches in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have consulted the highest level on the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s competition authority.
In the Eurozone, the Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been going on for over a year, so decisions that are now being taken in connection with the Bank could have a precedent.
In line with the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states buy the respective shares of the bank at about 49 percent.
The bank will probably sell some of its holdings, mainly the insurance activities purchased by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The Fortis shares started a steep descent last week, in the second half of the week serious crisis scenarios were already taking place.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with its 85,000 employees, is far too big for a break.
The institution's securities fell by 12% on Friday to a 14-year low.
Since January, the value of the shares has dropped by more than two thirds.
In view of the current share prices, the Group's market value amounts to EUR 14 billion, which according to management is unrealistic.
According to the management, the USD 700 billion cost American rescue package and the resulting uncertainty in the markets is owed to the valley of the Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, the courses have slightly increased.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed new Director General of the Bank.
The financial institution was also looking for a private buyer, but it did not find any interest in a material offer.
The Belgian government, however, was concerned about calming down - no investor should tremble for his money, it said.
No panic has broken out among customers so far, the branches of the bank have not been hit.
In Hungary, the Fortis has separate branches, but it also has its own leasing companies.
Fuchs in chickens
Because of a person's drug consumption, life and health insurance in America often refuses to enter into a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of the drug data to the consent of the subject in any case.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we trust in the fox the chickens" - quotes Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for tracking prescription data.
Insurance sets the fees and the amounts paid in the event of damage depending on the health status of the customer and should the risk be overestimated, the insurance will not be completed at all.
In the past, the customer was sent to a medical examination, and the contract was only concluded in the knowledge of the results of the investigation.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper method: using the customer's identification number, he has obtained the data of the last one and a half years from the pharmacies, which preparations were purchased, and the program calculates the disease of the customer and how his health is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it might be concluded that his blood fat levels are untreatable, which would automatically rank him in a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so that insurances only have to deal more with the paperwork, but there are smaller difficulties.
One of the drawbacks is that many medications can be taken for various purposes, such as against migraines and hot flushes, but also against depression.
The latter is a high risk factor from the insurer's point of view, while the above ones are not.
For the query and processing of the data, individual companies have formed which, before obtaining the data, ask the patient for his consent.
In the meantime, they have to do so by law, although omissions have not yet been notified.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory tests and combine them with the data on drug use, thus providing an even more accurate picture of the patient’s health status.
More and more companies have access to the data and control of their use becomes more difficult at the same time.
Although there is a separate data protection law for health data, its effect only extends to healthcare providers and insurance companies.
The draft law has already been presented to the Congress, according to which the authorities could also control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard sees that this is not enough, so he wants to further develop his program so that the data can only be passed on with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question, of course, is that the person concerned can hardly prevent access to his data, since the insurance companies otherwise do not conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens are left to some extent the grace of the fox.
Global menu of Marseilles
European Union and India double trade
After the European Union and India are both leading trading partners of each other, this was the main issue in addition to other global problems at the ninth summit.
Today, too, the French-Indian summit is taking place, in which mainly cooperation in the nuclear sector is discussed.
Although the European Union acknowledges that India is an emerging, democratic major power, which should be given more votes and co-rights in the case of international concerns, the Member States have not yet been able to agree whether or not to support the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was not discussed yesterday at the 9th Marseille Summit.
The French President and current President-in-Office of the Council Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana, received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached to double trade over the next five years, i.e. to increase to over EUR 100 billion.
In view of the fact that the trade in goods had increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this target is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also been legally incorporated into an agreement, so that in the future air transport will also be flown.
India intends to sign the Free Trade Agreement with the Union by 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The aim is to establish a balance between the EU and India at present unbalanced: while the Union is India's number one partner, New Delhi is only ranked nine among EU partners.
The summit was dedicated to global concerns.
This included the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as the terrorism which both sides strongly condemned, and the convening of a UN conference was also called for.
The Doha Round should also be concluded, both sides of which are to blame for their failure.
The EU stressed that it adheres to its energy and climate programme, i.e. that pollutant emissions should be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
India, as well as the proposal to close a kind of global compromise at the forthcoming climate summit, agreed to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
The rise in food prices should also be combated, so both support the convening of an international conference on the financial crisis.
Today, the head of government of India is visiting the French capital, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, it hopes for orders to French companies worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
The agreement is due to be adopted for 15 years, according to the Agency's notices.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th Book Fair, the most important international event for the acquisition of rights.
The international Frankfurt Book Fair awaits the current event of more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries. They will spread over the 171,790 square metres of the fair and present over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the guest of honour of the event.
The Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Property and Activities Maria Giro will represent the Italian government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented by the 264 sqm exhibition room "Punto Italia".
A press conference near the room structure will follow in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: on this occasion, numbers, trends and perspectives around publishing in Italy will be discussed.
According to the data, the importance of the books of foreign writers is decreasing throughout, but especially in the adult and youth sections.
A year ago, the billionaire Steve Fossett was found missing
The small plane of Steve Fossett, which disappeared on a flight over the desert of Nevada on September 3, 2007, was discovered.
The parts have been found on a high plateau of 3000 m altitude, in the area of the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the states of California and Nevada.
In the interior of the plane, however, no human remains were found.
Madera County's sheriff, John Anderson, fully expressed the last doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been located on which a troops have been sent out. Now we have the certainty that it is the plane with which Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found in the plane or its vicinity.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) noted that just a few hours after the aircraft was sighted a team was sent out identifying the machine: it was the Bellanca 8kcab that was lost on September 3, 2007, after Fossett started a 3-hour flight in Yerington in Nevada.
Finally, in California, near the border with Nevada, some of the personal items from Fossett were found from a couple near their home to Mammoth Lakes.
These are two IDs with the name Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned one month after its disappearance.
The billionaire had conquered a place in history by a long sequence of records.
In 2002, he was the first person to circle the world ball in a hot air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world in a single flight without a call on an aircraft.
Among its numerous records is also an altitude flight of 15445 m above the Andes, but this one with a co-pilot.
Glk, the ads you don't expect
A Suv that falls out of the traditional scheme through its original design and the special lineing, the discharge surface and its clear angle.
Mercedes-Benz has tried with this offroader to inhale the sector into a new breath.
Due to its exceptional properties, the presentation of the Suv Glk will be unconventional, which will be seen in the Mercedes-Benz Showroom from 17 October.
Thus, the advertising drum, which will accompany the appearance of the new model, will also appear in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a novelty in the car sector in backward Italy.
A project with a maximum cost that will be carried out in different phases, which will take the central shopping mile of Milan, the Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in form, where 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como will give the whole a special look: the new Suv will thus appear as a three-dimensional model in its almost real dimensions.
In fact, the car will appear to emerge from the poster on which it is depicted.
With the help of the Elumina8 technology, the new Glk is illuminated in all its details in different moments to reconstruct it as a whole.
Without a doubt it is the concern of Mercedes with this advertisement to introduce a new kind of autoclame in this rather stereotype field.
Will it be successful, however, to stimulate the interest of future buyers? We will see it.
Now it is clear who the Italian Hooligans are
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk the ban on stadiums
Who are only these 150-200 boys and girls, for whom all of Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group, which has been travelling for years by the Italian national team and which, frankly, until recently did not cause serious problems.
Never before has there been any clash with opposing fans.
The group's origin is in the right environment.
The sponsors come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
In Sofia, there were other smaller groups of Campania and Apulia.
They carry the Tricolori, on which the towns of the militants appear: they were removed on Saturday, however, to avoid identification.
Their role models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria there was now a clash with a truly right-wing radical fan scene, that of Levski.
By the Figc Italian fans had made 144 cards available for the game: all were displayed on names and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were all controlled by the Viminal: under the flight to Sofia, no one was using a running stadium ban procedure.
Four fans of the Italian team, who had already been preloaded in this respect, were thus denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
The Viminal now awaits the reports of the Bulgarian police in order to take further steps: in this case, the Tifosi arrested or identified at the time of the riots can expect to have a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban which prevents access to the stadiums throughout Europe.
So our hooligans will no longer set foot in a stadium.
Good luck.
But now, of course, there is fear of imitation cities, which could follow this little more than 150.
"This fire must be released immediately, and there is no way of justifying such behaviour," says the Viminal.
That's why, "Aye to above all also with a view to the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
In fact, there is a small core of the Italian Ultras in Apulia.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio (sports supervision) gathers the Casms, which can count on part of the Aise, i.e. the secret services dealing with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce calls and the raised right arm during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a crime..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (expressed in no pleasure), who has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over Francensco Tagliente's post and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously, Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where now a core of the supporters of Ultras Italia, founded in 2002.
While it is true, Mazzili says that it is not against the law in Bulgaria to praise the duce, it certainly was a disgrace to these 150-200 people.
"I am not a sociologist – add the No. 1 of the Osservatorio – crimes are committed in the land of their actions.
So far, this group had been in trouble, but now it is necessary to consider what has happened and will happen.
But we also talk about the piffs during the hymn Mamelis: even this is not a crime, but allow me, because there is no education ...".
