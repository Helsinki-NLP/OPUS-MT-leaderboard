Welsh Members do not want to appear as ‘muppets’
Members of the Welsh National Assembly, known today under the abbreviation AM (Assembly Members), are not entirely satisfied with the proposal that their title may be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal is due to the plans to change the name of the National Assembly of the Welsh Parliament.
Representatives from all over the political spectrum fear that this can lead to ridicule.
A representative from Labour explained his group was concerned because ‘it rhymes on Twp and Pwp’.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh twp means "dustede", and pwp means "bäsj".
A representative of the Wales Party Plaid Cymru said that the group as a whole was ‘unsatisfied’ and that they have proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh part of the conservative party said that his group was ‘open’ for the change of name, but noted that the pronunciation of MWP is very close to the word ‘Muppet’, which in addition to being the name of some known dolls, is also a British word for ‘dust’.
In this context, Welsh letter W is spoken in a similar way as the letter U is spoken in the English Yorkshire dialect, more like an "uh" sound.
Assembly Commission, which is currently developing laws to introduce the name change, said: ‘Of course, the members themselves have the last right of destination as to the name with which they are to be referred.’
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly authorisation to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation showing general support for the rebuff of the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of the representatives, the WMP (Welsh Parliament Members) Commission supported but the MWP option received the most support during the public hearing.
It seems that the representatives suggest other alternatives, but getting all the parties to reach an agreement can lead to the head office of President Elin Jones, who is scheduled to deliver a draft legislation for the change of name in the next few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes in the functioning of the national Parliament, including rules for disqualification of representatives and the design of the committee system.
The representatives have the last vote on what to call them when they debate the law.
Macedonians go to the polling towers to decide whether to change their country's name
Sunday, the people of Macedonia may vote on the change of the name of their country to ‘North Macedonia Republic’.
The referendum is held in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with the neighbouring country of Greece, which also has a region called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the Northern Neighbour constitutes a requirement in its territory and has on several occasions opposed its applications for EU and NATO membership.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum for the change of names, has said that he will ignore the vote.
The support players of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the change of name is simply the price they have to pay to participate in the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's stilts – the crickes of Harlem wear
"The old ones I talked to have told me that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Adams.
‘Now there are none of the parts.’
He said the bar's departure was understandable.
"People associate socially with each other in other ways," he says.
«Bars are no longer the meeting places of the local environment, as all visits regularly.»
As for the churches, he fears that the money from selling assets will not last as long as the leaders believe. ‘And sooner or later, they are back at the beginning.’
The churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings full of the kind of people who won't help the neighborhood's remaining resorts.
‘Most of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,’ he says, ‘and will therefore only accelerate the day when these churches have to close the doors permanently, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.’
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original White Methodist Union moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had stayed nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's got a black congregation under the priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott by dealers on 125th Street – one of Harlem's main officers – because they failed to hire or promote black workers.
A fire in 1939 caused great damage to the building, and when Father Johnson's parishioner had planned for the reconstruction they bought a carillon.
Prest David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and successor of St. Martin's, proudly declared that the carillon was «the church bells of the poor people».
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: ‘a cultural tax’ and ‘an irreplaceable historical instrument’.
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played on by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the largest carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's never replaced him.
What has taken place at St. Martin's in the past few months is a complex interaction between architects and entrepreneurs, some of whom are hired by the church's lay people's leadership and others by the birch judgment.
The Church Council – the administration of the congregation, consisting of laymen – wrote to the bishops in July about its concern that the bishops would ‘try to force the costs’ at the Church Council, despite the fact that the Council of Churches had not been involved in the initiation of the architects or the contractors sent by the bishops.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the bishops.
Hai hurts thirteen-year-old lobster dolls in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy as he appeared after lobsters in California on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dived with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy yelling for help, and that he and a group of others swam across to drag the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel, he thought at first that the boy cried out of enthusiasm for having caught a lobster, but he realized that the boy cried out 'I was bitten!'
I was bitten!"
His entire collarbone was torn up," says Hammel, who discovered the damage as he reached the boy.
'I cried out that everyone had to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!', added Hammel.
The boy was transported by air ambulance to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is presented in critical condition.
The type of shark that carried out the attack is unknown.
Navy captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said that the victim was seriously injured in the upper torso.
The authorities closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and safety purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to take on the beauty market of the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's challenge is Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-like makeup and beauty shelves, manned by specially trained staff.
The expanded shelves are tested in 11 shops around the country as part of a strong invasion of the UK 2.8 million beauty market, which is constantly growing while the numbers of clothes and home items are falling. If the experiment proves successful, the concept will be extended to several shops next year.
The investment in beauty care is a result of the attempts by the supermarket to find a new use of the site previously used for TVs, microwaves and home articles.
Sainsbury's has said that they should double the number of beauty products they offer to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, that the store chain has never sold before.
Existing product selections from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also get better space in noted brand areas, just as in stores like Boots.
The supermarket chain also relaunches its boutique make-up brand with mainly vegan products, because there is increasing demand for this among younger customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer The Fragrance Shop has to test out sales tables in two Sainsbury's shops. One opened in Croydon in south London last week, while the other opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Networking and a new tendency to buy small quantities of food daily from local grocery stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to tempt customers to arrive.
Mike Coupe, Managing Director of Sainsbury's, has said that the sales are going to look more and more like a commodity magazine, as the supermarket takes up the fight against cheap shops Aldi and Lidl with more services and goods away from food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos sales in hundreds of shops, and has also introduced a number of Habitat sales after purchasing both chains two years ago. According to them, this has increased food sales and made purchases more profitable.
The previous supermarket attempt to upgrade beauty care departments and pharmacy products failed.
Sainsbury's tested cooperation with Boots early in the 2000s, but the cooperation was terminated following a dispute over the distribution of income from the pharmacies in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sale of its 281 stores to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy pharmacy, GBP 125 million three years ago.
According to them, Lloyds will participate in the plan, by adding a selection of luxury beauty brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s business director, said: “We have transformed the appearance and design of the beauty shelves to create more welcoming surroundings for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained staff who are so prepared to provide advice and help.
Our brand selection is designed to meet all needs, and the inviting surroundings and practical locations make us now a beauty competitor representing a new experience of action.’
Peter Jones is ‘rapid’ after Holly Willoughby withdraws from an agreement worth GBP 11 million
Dragons' The St. Peter Jones is supposed to be furious after TV-host Holly Willoughby withdrew from an 11 million contract with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home and accessories brand, Truly.
Their company was previously compared to Gwyneth Paltrows brand, Goop.
Willoughby (37) who is program manager in This Morning, announced on Instagram that she is leaving the company.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons' The Star Peter Jones furious by withdrawing from their profitable lifestyle brand in the last second to focus on their own new gold-plated contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was “rapid” at an attractive meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. It was here that the gold girl of the television admitted that her new contracts – worth up to GBP 1.5 million – mean that she no longer has time left to their clothes and accessories brand, Truly.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrows brand, Goop, and it was expected that it would double Willoughby's estimated asset of GBP 11 million.
While Willoughby (37) announced on Instagram that she is going to leave Truly, Jones left the United Kingdom on the way to one of her vacation homes.
One source said, "Truly was undoubtedly Holly's first priority.
It was a long-term investment that was to give her financial security over the next decades.
Everyone is totally shocked that she has chosen to withdraw.
There was no one who could believe it when it happened last Tuesday – it was just before the launch.
Now there is a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow headquarters that is now ready for sale.»
Experts believe that the This Morning Programme Manager, who is among the most popular stars in the United Kingdom, can cost the company several million pounds due to large investments in products such as cushions and lights,mots and cos clothes, as well as a potential delay in launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Three-children's mother Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for the last ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) became Chairman of the Board in March.
The two couples go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% ownership interest in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby shall become the M&S brand ambassador and shall replace Ant McPartlin, which will host the ITV I'm A Celebrity.
A source standing near Jones said yesterday 'We will not comment on his business affairs'.
Checkmates ‘and then we fell in love’
He knew of the criticism he would receive from the news media for having made a comment some would consider a little presidenty, and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given away so much?
Trump said in his imitation of a news anchor.
‘I have not given away anything at all.’
He noted that Kim was interested in a new meeting, after he himself declared that their first meeting in Singapore in June was a great mess on the road to nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stopped.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in June, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho, the world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday told us that North Korea has not seen a ‘correspondent response’ from the United States on its early disarmament measures.
He noted that the United States, instead, still has sanctions that aim to keep up the pressure.
Trump had a much more positive attitude when he spoke for a gathering of his constituents.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
‘We were going to war with North Korea.
Many millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a very good relationship."
He said that his work to improve the relationship with Kim has given positive results, such as putting a stop to rocketsters, helping to get the hostages released and getting the lives sent home by American officials.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to act with presidential dignity, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this stepped arena, we would have about 200 people standing right here," said Trump and pointed in the area right in front of him.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia are raging an island and killing hundreds of people
In the wake of the Lombok earthquake, non-resident NPISHs were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the loss of more than 10 % of Lombox residents, a national disaster was not declared, which is a requirement for international assistance to be sent in.
‘In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it quite clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so it is quite challenging,’ explained Sumbung.
Saving the children is now putting together a team to travel to Palu, but is not yet sure whether foreign employees will be allowed to work in the country.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the National Emergency Management Office, said that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international organisations should be allowed to contribute to the relief work.
Given the constant threat to Indonesia's earthquakes, the country is terribly poorly prepared to deal with nature's anger.
Lying to protect against tsunamis is built in Aceh, but they are not a common sight along other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a warning system on Palu, although a warning had been sent out, has probably contributed to the death rates.
Even in the best of circumstances, it is a challenge to travel between Indonesia's many islands.
Natural disasters make logistics even more challenging.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo upgraded Indonesia's fall-out infrastructure to a key point in his election campaign, and has spent a lot of money on the road and rail.
But lack of money has been a major problem for Joko's administration, which will be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from sustained sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have moved to a more conservative form of Islam.
More than 1000 people were killed and several tens of thousands had to flee their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs were destroyed in the streets with machetes, arrows and bow and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool Daniel Sturridge with late compensation in battle against Chelse
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from the Premier League defeat against Chelsea on Saturday by cutting for 89 minutes in the fight at Stanford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a passport from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from the Chelsea target while his team was 1-0 behind.
He moved the ball to the left foot before he sent it towards the longest corner.
The test went high above the box as the ball dropped toward the top right corner of the grid.
The ball finally went over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
‘I just tried to get to that position and get the ball, and players like Shaq always send the ball forward as well as it can be done, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible,’ said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
‘I saw Kante come and hit the ball once and didn’t think too much about it and just kicked it further.’
Chelsea led by 1-0 at the break, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal for 25 minutes.
The Blues attacker sent back a passport with his heel to Mateo Kovacic, before he changed direction near the midway and pushed into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic made a quick handover in the middle lane.
He then fired off a great breakthrough fit that led Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran faster than the defense and drove the ball into the net in the longest corner with a left foot kicking past the Liverpool Alisson Becker.
Liverpool plays against Naples in the group game of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in the European League in football for men in London at 3 p.m. on Thursday.
The death toll from the tsunami of Indonesia reaches 832
The deaths of Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami have increased to 832, notified the country’s crisis management office early on Sunday.
It was reported that many were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed after the earthquake with a strike of 7,5 that hit the country on Friday and caused waves of up to six meters, explained the entity's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was full of materials from demolished buildings.
Police arrest man (32) for murder after a woman gets stabbed to death
A murder investigation has begun after the corpse of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found with stab wounds at 7:55 in Grayson Mews in John Street. A 32-year-old man was attacked, suspected of killing.
The police have asked people in the area who have seen or heard anything about contacting.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan says, "We are at the very beginning of the investigation, but I want to ask everyone who was in the area around John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious about contacting us.
We also ask everyone, especially taxi driver, who may have caught something on his car camera, to make contact – they may have information that is essential to our investigation.”
A police spokesperson has confirmed that the deceased woman was resident in Birkenhead, and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon friends who think they know the woman have arrived at the place to ask questions about the place where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police have said that they are working to inform the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but has been told that no one is allowed to go in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
The residents are now told that it will take several hours before they get back in.
A police officer was interrogated when he told a man that the whole area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared at the scene.
She repeats “it’s so terrible” over and over again.
At 14 o'clock two police cars stood behind the lockdown, while a third car was just outside.
A number of police officers stood outside the lockdown and had oversight of the apartment complex.
Persons who have information are asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, by referring to ‘log 247’ as of 30 September.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell is the last memorial that has been dragged into the debate on 'Rewrite History'.
The removal of the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious taxes that were carried out by his fanatical puritan adherents.
But the Comwell Society's history has described Jeremy Crick's publishing house as 'stupid' and 'an attempt to rewrite history'.
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Society, says, "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Westminster Palace was also going to be a goal.
Neither Cromwell ordered nor executed the iconoclasm of the British Civil War.
Perhaps wrong Cromwell will be punished for the sins of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's amazing presentation of Cromwell is a proof of the 1800s opinions and is part of the historiography of a man many still think deserve to be hailed.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is becoming by many, perhaps more late in the 1800s than today, seen as Parliament's defender against outside pressure – in his time, of course, it was talking about the monarchy.
Whether this is an exact representation is still the subject of historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 1600s has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure that represents one side of that conflict.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering.»
Killing Pigs Killing Chinese Farmers
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on the market in south-west China, according to local news reports.
The man, only mentioned by the surname ‘Yuan’, was found dead and covered with blood from a cracked artery near a beige on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to put vaccines on pigs on a farm on 30 May 2005 in the city of Xining, Qinghai province of China.
He had apparently traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The morning after the cousin found him dead, and discovered that the gate of a nearby piggy was standing open.
He said that inside the pig pen there was a big mistake of blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the pig of 250 kg had killed the man.
"Less to my cousin was bloody and malted" explained the cousin, referred to by the surname Wu, in a quote to Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance camera footage showed Yuan went into the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His corpse was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan did not belong to him or his cousin.
While the police collected evidence from the scene, one of the market leaders explained that the pig was locked in to prevent it from attacking anyone else.
Yuan's family and market management are negotiating compensation for the death.
Even if it happens to be the source, it's not the first time it's been registered that a pig has infected people.
In 2016, a married couple attacked a pig on a Massachusetts farm and caused serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a Welsh farmer was pushed up against a tractor and attacked by a pig of 300 kg until the farmer's wife managed to destroy the animal.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba to CBC News explained that pigs are not aggressive to ordinary, but that the taste of blood can have a triggering effect.
‘They only play.
They like to bite, and they're very curious... they're not trying to hurt anyone.
You must only show sufficient respect.»
The remains of the Hurricane Rosa will result in severe rain in the south-west US
As reported, Hurricane Rosa is weakened as it moves across the cooler seas on the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will be passing through north-Mexico and south-west USA on her journey in the next few days.
Rosa had a wind force of 135 km/h and was a hurricane of category 1 at 05.00 ET on Sunday, and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a trough begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and moves east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will start pushing tropical humidity northward towards the south-west of America.
Rosa will cause up to 25 cm of rainfall in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the interaction between tropical humidity and the thread approaching will lead to widespread heavy rain in the south-west of the next days.
Locally, 3 to 10 cm of rain will lead to dangerous floods, liquid rushes and rapid and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep-tropical humidity will lead to precipitation rates of up to 5-7 cm per hour in some areas, in particular southern areas of Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 5-10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the south-west country, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There are opportunities for floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the spread of tropical rain.
It is very unwise to move around in the desert on foot as long as there is a risk of tropical precipitation.
Heavy rains can cause river valleys to become broad rushing rivers, and thunders will lead to local gusts that can contain dust and sand.
The thread approaching will result in local heavy rain showers for parts of the coast along southern California.
Total rainfall above 1.3 cm is possible, which can lead to liquid rust and rapid, as well as smooth roadways.
This will be the region's first rainfall.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before the rain spreads later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the corner states on Tuesday and last all Wednesday.
October can cause some intense temperature fluctuations all over the United States as the Arctic gets colder but the tropics keep very warm.
Sometimes this leads to drastic temperature changes over shorter distances.
We will see a clear example of strong temperature differences throughout Central America on Sunday.
There will be almost 11 degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, sustained summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of Central and East America are likely to take a warm start in October, with degrees high in the 20th century from Southern Plains to parts of North-East America.
New York City could reach 26.5 degrees on Tuesday -- this would be about 5.5 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate report indicates that the East US is most likely to have higher temperatures than usual throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million viewers, divided into six TV networks, saw Thursday's gripping witness from Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that must have taken place in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political feud continued, and broadcasters suspended their regular broadcasts to announce Friday's great surprise in the last second, when it came out that the senator for Arizona, Jeff Flake, had arranged it so that the FBI would conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate court committee that she was 100 percent sure that a drunk Kavanaugh felt her and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh insisted that he is 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
The shipment on Friday was probably seen by more than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported.
The company calculated average ratings for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of audiences was not immediately available to other networks showing the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems measuring office viewers.
To give you a little perspective, this is the number of viewings that correspond to the final game of the American soccer championship or the Oscar distribution.
Fox News Channel, whose polls have supported Kavanaugh's appointment with great enthusiasm, led by the networks, with an average audience of 5.69 million for the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC was number two with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CCNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the main character of Friday's drama.
The moderate Republican's office delivered an opinion that he was going to vote in Kavanaugh's favor. On Friday morning he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras trying to take the elevator to a court committee meeting while demonstrators screamed and shouted at him.
He stood with lowered glances for several minutes while he was being scorched out, while the event was sent directly to the CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling our country the truth?"
He was told that 'you have the power when so many women are powerless'.
Flake pointed out that his office had delivered an opinion, and said as the elevator doors closed, that he would have more to say about the matter at committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting networks covered all the hearing directly several hours later, when the court committee was to vote on whether Kavanaugh’s nomination should be continued throughout the Senate for reconciliation.
But Flake said he was willing to do this only if the FBI examined the charges against the candidate within the next week, to which the democratic minority has urged.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after talking to the Counts and then several other senators.
Flakes' choice had a great impact, as it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May accuses the critics of ‘political game’ around Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, the British Prime Minister Theresa May accused the opponents of her plan to leave the EU to play ‘political games’ with the future of the United Kingdom and undermine the national interests.
The UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, printed side by side with her own on the front page of the paper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson has continued his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit by saying that a proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was 'very ridiculous'.
Wayde Sims shooting: Police attack Dyteon Simpson, suspected of causing the LSU player's death
The police have attacked a man suspected of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player for Louisiana State University.
Dyteon Simpson (20) is arrested and targeted for deliberate killing, according to Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video recording of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the Basque.
The police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS partner WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he admits to having shot and killed Wayde.
His deposit is set at USD 350,000, according to The Advocate.
The forensics officer of East Baton Rouge Parish published an interim report on Friday, where the cause of death is indicated as a bullet wound in the head and through the neck.
The police thank Louisiana Stat Police for their work group on the collection of refugees, the federal police laboratory, the Southern University police force and the local population for contributing to the investigation that led to an attack.
LSU’s sports leader Joe Alleva thanked the area’s police force for his ‘hard work and search for justice’.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 m high forward player grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 returns per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball trainer Will Wade said the team was "cracked" and "in shock" after Wayde's death.
'This is what we fear at all times,' said Wade.
The volcano sprays ash over Mexico City
The ash spraying out of the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southernmost neighbourhoods of Mexico’s capital.
The Centro Nacional de Prevención de Desastres, Mexico's Public Office for Crisis Prevention, warned Mexico's population on Saturday that they had to stay away from the volcano after the activity increased in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded in one day.
The stage monitored several cases of bulging and shaking.
Images on social media showed a thin layer of ash that covered windscreens on the cars in neighborhoods like Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicists have discovered increased activity from the volcano, which is 72 km south-east of the capital after a 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as ‘Don Goyo’, has been active since 1994.
Police in clashes with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the vote of independence
Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after protesters of independence had a clash with the police, while several thousand participated in competing demonstration stations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarising vote on release.
A group of masked separatists were held back by the rebel police, and bombarded them with eggs and powder paints, causing dark dust clouds in streets that are usually full of tourists.
Handcuffs also broke out later in the day, when the police used batons to limit the fighting.
For several hours, independence demonstrators stood and shouted ‘Never forget, never forgive’, face-to-face with Unionist demonstrators calling ‘Long live Spain’.
Fourteen persons were treated for minor damage they received during protests, according to the local press.
The tension is still high in the liberation-oriented region one year after the referendum on 1 October, which was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The vote showed an overwhelming overstatement of redundancy, but it was poor attendance because the vote was boycotted by most people who opposed the liberation.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1000 people were injured in violent confrontations last year, after the police tried to stop the vote that was held at electoral stations throughout the region.
Liberation teams set foot in the streets night to Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was held, however, but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer had any hope of being independent of Catalonia.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying out of joy at getting voice, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite having achieved a narrow but decisive win in regional elections last December, parties supporting Catalan independence have had problems holding up pressure this year, after many of their well-known leaders have gone into self-imposed exile or are in custody while awaiting legal proceedings for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who used his phone to film the protest to support the police, said the conflict is fueled by politicians on both sides.
‘The situation is getting more and more tense’, he explained.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison awaiting a trial since last year, announced that he will be at the European Parliament elections next year.
"To stand for election as a candidate in the European elections is the best thing I can do to condemn the repression and the regression of democratic values that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: They were arrested after a car was driven into a house wall
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car was driven several times into the wall of a house in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7.30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the incident had caused damage to the gate and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been fired against the car at some point.
Mengas attack leads to Livingston's 1-0 win against Rangers
Dolly Mengas first goal for Livingston secured the win
Revered Livinston amazed Rangers, who delivered Stevens Gerrard's other losses after 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox Club.
A good hit from Dolly Menga turned out to be crucial, and Gary Holt's side is now similar to the Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side has still not won away at the Premier League this season and is going to play against the leaders of Hearts, which is eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Before this, Rangers will play home fight against Rapid Wien in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, on his side, has remained uninjured through six battles in the division. Chief Holt has not yet lost a battle after he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against her sleepy guests
Holt's team should have led long before they scored, as their direct procedure caused countless problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the but bomb on the target, and Alan Lithgow could only send the kick forward after slipping in to meet Craig Halkett header past the target.
The hosts piloted Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could make trouble for their guests at death's ball.
And that's how the crucial goal came about.
Rangers gave off a free park and Livingston found an opening – Declan Gallagher and Robinson cooperated to give Menga clear track, and he scored a goal from the middle of the box.
At this stage the Rangers had had the ball mostly all the time, but the home team defense had proved to be impenetrable and goal-watched Liam Kelly had little to worry about.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos performed a near-scoring that had to be saved by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was blocked by the feet of Rangers keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgrow sent a Livingston death ball in a brief fit.
Crossings continued to enter the Livingston Box and were still saved, while two criminal claims – once after Halkett’s protest against exchange rate Glenn Middleton, and once by hand – were overlooked.
‘Fenomic’ from Livingston – Analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont on Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were amazing all of them, and they continue to surpass all expectations on the way up.
The game style and the team has hardly changed since they got to the top again, but Holt will have much of the credit for the way he has strengthened it after his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic and coordinated a tremendously well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the toe raise throughout the battle.
Rangers, on the other hand, didn't have my inspiration to divorce.
Although at times they have been very good under Gerrard, they have not been able to live up to this standard.
The last part of the game was labs – they only got into the home team's lane half once – and it was a bit of a wake-up for Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Cologne
Everything was just smile and blue sky on Saturday September 29th, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany ate lunch together in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship between the NATO allies.
Human rights, freedom of the press and the entry of Turkey into the European Union have been fragmented.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police reported security as the reason why a population of 25 000 was not allowed to gather in front of the mosque, but many followers met nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan — many of them Kurds — were also heard from, criticizing both Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to let him into the country.
The conflicting demonstrations reflect the division that follows a man who is hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Deptford Collision: Cyclist killed in a car collision
A biker is killed in a collision like a London passenger car.
The collision took place at the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, which is a busy road in the Deptford south-east of the city, about 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the clinic was treated by ambulance staff, but the man died on site.
The collision takes place only one month after a cyclelist died in a driveway where the driver escaped from the scene on Childrens Street, about one mile from Saturday’s collision.
Metropolitan Police said the police are working to identify the man and notify the relatives.
Roadblocks and buses are in place, and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six officers injured in riots
Six prison officers are injured in an incident in a high-security prison for men, according to the prison authorities.
The riots broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09.30 BST on Sunday, and still ongoing.
Specialised ‘Tornado’ officers have been picked up to deal with the incident, involving eight prisoners and limited to one flight.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries on site.
One prison spokesperson said: ‘Specially trained prison staff have been sent in to deal with an ongoing HMP Long Lartin incident.
Six employees have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons – those responsible will be transferred to the police, and may have to spend even more time behind locks and beats.»
HMP Long Lartin lives more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director received hospital treatment after being attacked by an inmate.
And last October, insurrection police were called in to deal with a serious incident in which the employees were attacked with billiard balls.
The Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with floods (may be beneficial for drying areas)
It is the source of Arizona taken by a tropical lowprint, but just that will probably happen early next week, as the remaining force of the Hurricane Rosa is moving through the desert areas in the south and carries flood hazards.
National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for Western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will move in a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, and that the rain weather will start late Monday night.
National Weather Service in Phoenix has noted on Twitter that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane until it was 65 km from the border with Arizona.»
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 5-10 cm of rainfall, up to 15 cm in some places in Mongolia Rim in Arizona.
Other areas within the desert in the south-west, including the center of the Rocky Mountains mountain range and Great Basin, are likely to get between 2.5 and 5 cm, while up to 10 cm of rainfall is possible in some areas.
For those who are out of flood danger, Rosa may be a blessing, since the area suffers from drought.
Although flood is a serious problem, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial, since the south-west US is currently in a state of drought.
According to weather.com, according to the United States Drought Monitor, slightly more than 40 percent of Arizona is at least extremely dry, which is the second highest category.
First, the hurricane hits Rosa on the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa still has hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind force of 137 km, located 620 km from Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moving 19 km/h.
The storm encounters colder waters in the Pacific, losing power.
Therefore, it is expected to meet Mexico with tropical storm power on Monday evening or afternoon.
Precipitation over parts of Mexico can be severe and lead to great flooding.
‘Total rainfall of 7,5–15 cm is expected from Baja California to north-west Sonora, with possibilities for up to 25 cm of rainfall’ according to weather.com.
Rosa will then move north over Mexico as a tropical storm until it hits the frontier of Arizona dawning Tuesday morning as a tropical lowland, which this moves further through Arizona and into southern Utah within the late Tuesday evening.
‘The main father expected of Rosa or its remains is very severe rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States’, according to the National Hurricane Center.
This precipitation is expected to produce life-threatening floods and liquid rushes and rapid in the desert and landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Attacks for Killing
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man are under attack, suspected of attempted killing, after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4:00 BST on Sunday.
He was driven to the hospital, and his condition shall be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, according to the police in Avon and Somerset.
The police have asked anyone who may have a mobile recording of the event to contact.
Trump says that Kavanaugh has "suffered under the smallness and mind" of the democratic party
‘A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the reckless and shocking tactics of the democratic party’, said Trump in front of a popular meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has ‘suffered under the smallness and mind’ of the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed in front of the Congress on Thursday, and denied the powerful and emotional charges of Christine Blasey Ford that he committed a sexual assault on her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testifies to his accusation at the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw where brilliant, capable and brave" Kavanaugh was that day.
‘A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to support one of the most competent lawyers of our time, with a sense of public service,’ he told a gathering of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred a discrepancy to Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about how important it is for Republicans to vote in the middle of the elections.
«We are five weeks away from one of our most important choices in our lifetime.
I'm not really a participant, but I'm a participant," he said.
‘That’s why I travel around fighting for the best candidates.’
Trump claimed that the democrats aim at ‘resisting and preventing’.
The Senate's first interim vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to the assistant of a leader of the Republican Party to CNN.
Several hundred killed by Indonesian landslides and tsunami, the numbers are expected to rise
At least 384 were killed and many were dragged out to sea by huge waves that duned against the shores when a large earthquake and a tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Slawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the town of Palu on Friday, when up to six meters high waves dwindled in land around sunset, destroyed everything in their way and dragged many out into drowning deaths.
The tsunami came into the heels of an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
‘When the tsunami was born yesterday, people still had activities on the beach, did not immediately escape and ended up as victims,’ said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia’s Office for Crisis Management (BNBP) at a Jakarta press conference.
‘Tsunami was not alone — it carried cars, three tribes and houses, it hit everything on land,’ Nugroho said, and added that the tsunami had moved over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before it hit the coastline.
Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived."
Around 16,700 persons were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Air photography published by the crisis management seat showed many damaged buildings and shops, twisted and broken bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
After-sleep continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The Earthquake bill could be felt by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Use Act (BPPT) stated in a statement that the power of Friday's huge earthquake was about 200 times more than the power of the nuclear bomb released over Hiroshima during World War II.
The location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay may have made the tsunami bigger, according to the ether.
Nugroho described the damage as ‘overall’ and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the death tolls and damage could be larger the country's coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the heart of the earthquake.
The communication ‘was completely depraved, completely uninformed’ from Donggala, according to Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there,” said Red Cross in a press release, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
«This is already a tragedy, but it can become much worse.»
On Saturday, the etching was strongly criticized for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, but the authorities said that the waves had hit before the warning was issued.
In an amateur recording shared by social media, a man on the top floor of a building shout desperate warnings that the tsunami is approaching passersby on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water comes down against the beach, and demolishes buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to immediately authenticate the recordings.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power breach that has prevented communication on Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue work.
The military has begun to ship transport aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuated have still desperately needed food and other necessities.
The city airport is only open for relief work and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll after the tsunami in Indonesia is rising above 800.
It's awful.
World Vision's staff from Donggala have come safely to the Palu center, where they have sought shelter under the tarpaulin in the courtyard in front of their office, but they passed great destruction on the road, according to Doseba Sinay.
"They told me they saw hundreds of broken houses," he said.
It's awful.
In the wake of the bitter preparations for delivery of emergency aid, aid organisations complained to some that foreign relief workers with a lot of expertise were refused to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, money, supplies and workers from abroad cannot be released into a crisis zone until declared a national disaster area.
It has not yet happened.
‘There is still a provincial disaster’ said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'Greek, this is a national disaster' we can open the borders of international aid, but the situation has not yet got any status."
As the sun descends over Palu for the second time after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those who are still missing are to be among the miracles that brighten up the gloomy news image of tragic natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was fished out of a sewer.
On Sunday, a woman was liberated from rescue teams after spending two days trapped under ruins with the corpse of her mother next to her.
Gendon Subando, the coach of the national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliding for Asialeks, which was conducted earlier this month in Indonesia.
Several of those caught in the ruins of the Roa Roa Hotel, including Petra Mandagi, were also his students.
"As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional ought to wear," he said.
Gendon told me that in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel was spread in the paragliding environment, he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the practitioners who attended the beach festival at Palu.
But the messages only led to gray pick marks, rather than a few blue pick marks.
"I think it means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Tyver steals USD 26 750 under mini-banking in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole USD 26 750 from a Brink's worker who filled a mini-bank in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver had emptied a mini-bank in the entertainment complex and got ready to deliver more money, wrote detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, there was another man who ‘run up behind the Brink’s employees’ and stole a bag of money that was to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspect escapes from the scene, according to the press release, but the police have not specified how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identity must contact the Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes its name to Ye
Kanye West, the rapper, changes his name to Ye.
When he announced the change to Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, "The creation was previously known as Kanye West."
West (41) has had Ye nickname for a long time, and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was launched in June.
The change comes before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande on the show, after she cancelled on 'emotional basis', according to the serial creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said that the word has a religious significance for him.
'I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'', said West earlier this year, when he discussed the album title with the Big Boy radio host.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It went from being Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – as a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more a representation of who we are."
He's one of many famous rappers who's changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as both Puff Daddy, P. Didy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously cooperated with West, has also varied between the use of hyphens and capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO swears not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's acceding president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has sworn that he should never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody reprisals against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that he ‘never will ever use the military to suppress the Mexican people’.
Military troops shot at a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people, during a period when left-wing political student movements took root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies to students and opening several free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double its financial support for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend on research in this field, according to Kai Fu Lee, the investor and the performer of artificial intelligence, who has the job of Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments come after several departments of the U.S. government have come with notices about artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the United States generally does not have a formal strategy of artificial intelligence.
China, on its side, introduced a plan last year and aims to be number 1 in innovation for artificial intelligence by 2030.
"A double research budget for artificial intelligence will be a good starting point since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next major breakthrough," said Lee.
Double financial support can double the chance of the next major achievement in artificial intelligence coming from the United States," Lee told this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is director of Sinomation Ventures, who has invested in one of the leading companies of artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University to develop an artificial intelligence system that struck the U.S.'s best Othello player, and later was a leader of Microsoft Research or director of Google's Chinese department.
Lee recognized the American government's former technology competitions, as Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one will be held, to help find the next generation of wise heads.
Researchers in the United States often have to work very hard to receive government appropriations, according to Lee.
"It is not China that steals the academic leaders, it is the companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed wise heads from universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee says that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that those who have a doctorate degree in artificial intelligence should be offered a residence permit automatically," he said.
The Chinese State Council issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan for the development of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation finances people at academic institutions,in a similar way as the National Science Foundation and other government organisations distribute money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, according to Lee.
Earlier this year, the US Defence Department established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of USD 2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
With regard to NSF, they are currently investing more than USD 100 million in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, the US legislation aimed at establishing a national safety commission for artificial intelligence has been suspended for several months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country’s name to the ‘North Macedonia Republic’ in order to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked their efforts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia, believes that the name of the northern neighbour constitutes a claim on Greek territory and has vetoed them to include them in NATO and the EU.
The two governments made an agreement in June based on the proposed new hub, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Macedonian majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycotting campaign has raised doubts as to whether the attendance will meet the 50 per cent minimum requirement, which is mandatory for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot is, ‘Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership when approving the agreement with Greece’.
Those who support the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying this price for Macedonia, one country that arose after Yugoslavia’s fall, to be eligible for membership of organisations such as the EU and NATO.
‘I came here today to vote for the country’s future, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the EU’s protective umbrella, because it means a safer life for all of us,’ said Olivera Georgijevska (79) in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, it is likely to be decisive because a large enough number of Members have said that they will comply with the outcome of the vote.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission said they had not received any irregular reports by 13.00.
However, the attendance was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters gave their vote.
‘I came to vote because of my children – we belong in Europe’, said Gjose Tanevski (62) who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and the son Dushko vote in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018. The referendum in Macedonia is about changing the country's name to open the doors so that they can become members of NATO and the EU.
Before Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) clarified a small scene and pulled out chairs in front of tents set up by those who are going to boycott the vote.
‘We are positive to NATO and the EU, but we will be notified with a raised head, not being let in the back way’, says Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our value.
If they do not accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to countries such as China and Russia and become part of European integration.»
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will lead to an intrusive investment in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
‘I think most people will be too, because more than 80 of our citizens want us to join the EU and NATO’, Zaev says after voting.
He says that a 'yes' response will be a 'confirmation of our future'.
According to a survey published last Monday by the Institute of Political Research of Macedonia, between 30 and 43 per cent of the voting rights will participate in the referendum – this is lower than the required attendance.
Another study, carried out by Macedonia's Telma TV, showed that 57 percent of those who responded plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they were going to vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, the attendance must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious political obstacle the pro-Western government has encountered since it took over in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero maneuvers past the entire Brighton defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2–0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored a goal for 65 minutes.
The Argentine attack player received a match at the start of the sequence.
He ran around the race with three Brighton defenders before he got out on the open track.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around one defender before he ran from several on the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he sent a passport to the left that reached Sterling.
The English attacker used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used right shoes to beat Brighton's keeper Matthew Ryan with a shot into the right-hand side of the web.
“Aguero still has some foot problems,” the City manager Pep Guardiola told the press.
“We talked about that he was going to play 55–60 minutes.
That's what happened.
It was lucky that he scored a goal right then."
But it was Sterling that gave Sky Blues the original advantage of the Premier League game.
This goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball into Brighton's territory.
He sent a beautiful breakthrough fit along the left flank to Leory Sane.
Sane had a few contacts before he led Sterling towards the longest corner.
Sky Blues attacker sent the ball into the net just before it was over the deadline.
City plays against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will be spoiler for Rockies
Nationals are no longer candidates for playoffs, and have no reason to bet heavily.
The always equally competitive Scherzer hopes to stand on the track on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if it can affect the playoffs of the Colorado team, who lead over Los Angeles Dodgers with one fight in NL West.
Rockies got a wild card slot with a 5-2 saying over National Friday night, but is still looking to secure their first division title.
Although we don't have anything to win, we can at least play with the knowledge that the mood here in Denver, with the audience and the other team, will be what is most likely to be the highest level I get to play this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate in it?'
The Nationals have still not announced their starting pitcher for Sunday, but should apparently be inclined to take Scherzer pitche in such a situation.
Sherzser, who in that case is starting pitcher for 34th time, had a bully session on Thursday, and will throw with normal rest on Sunday.
The right-hand Washington player has this season won 18 matches and lost 7, with an ERA of 2,53 and 300 strikeouts of 220 2/3 rounds.
Trump People's Assembly in West Virginia
The President referred to discrepancy with the situation surrounding the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of the Republicans voting at the intermediate elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
This is one of the big, big... I'm not a participant, but I'm a participant -- that's why I'm traveling around fighting for the best candidates," he said.
Trump continued "You see this cruel, cruel group of radical democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to take power back at all costs.
They don't care who they hurt, who they must overrun to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we won't give it to them."
The democracies, he said, are aimed at ‘resisting and preventing’.
‘And you see it over the last four days,’ he said, calling the Democrats ‘not bad and ugly and dishonest’.
He referred to the Senate court committees and mentioned the democratic senator, Diane Feinstein, by name, upon which the audience bowed loudly.
«Do you remember her answer?
Did you play the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um no, I'm waiting for you – it was very bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen.”
Labour is no longer open to everyone.
They don't tolerate people who say their opinion.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was hardly a surprise enough.
After all, I am the last in a large number of Labour Members who have been told that we are not welcome, just because we say what we mean.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment because she was very critical of anti-Semitism.
In my case, I had to be censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
As to the importance of having responsible economic policies, on national security, on Europe — ironically, similar things that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders about.
At the lookout for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday, it was said that ‘we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive’.
In most of my eight years as the local Labour representative, the GC meetings on Friday evenings have been exactly this.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the mood of many of the meetings, and the promise of ‘softer, friendly’ policies is too long forgotten, if at all it ever began.
It becomes increasingly clear that different opinions are not allowed in the working party and all opinions are judged on the basis of their acceptability for the management of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues I previously thought that I shared many political views with suddenly began to expect me to take a U-turn and stand for opinions I had never previously agreed with, either to the security of the nation or to the internal market of the European Union.
When I speak publicly – and it has nothing to say about what I say – I receive a variety of bad messages on social media that require me to be dismissed, condemns center policy and tells me that I should not be in Labour.
And it's not just me who's experienced this.
I know that I am happier with some of my colleagues, because the comments I receive are usually political.
I know how professional and targeted these colleagues are when they meet a sea that sexually discriminatory and racist comments every day, but never let themselves be.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how gross separation has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the working party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer such a party that is open to everyone, and every mistrust proposal and every change in electoral rules is narrowing the party.
I have received many advice in the last two years where I am encouraged to keep my head low and not raise my voice so much, because it will ‘make everything better’.
But that's not why I got involved in the policy.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school student, provoked by the failure of the Thatcher government that had led to my classroom at the public school I went to literally fall, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most, both as local councilman and government minister.
I have never hidden my political opinions, nor in previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East can in any way have misunderstood my political views or disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who put forward the representative proposal on Friday, I just want to say that as the country rages our way towards a Brexit that will harm individuals, businesses and public services, I cannot grasp and understand the desire to waste time and effort on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the message I really want to convey is not to Nottingham Momentum – it's to those I represent, whether they're Labour members or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of dismissal or political uncompromisingness will prevent me from doing what I think best serves their interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeseiched Ayr rises to the top
Two late attempts have changed the end result a little, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this amazing entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
They're now at the top of the table, and they're the only ones without the ten.
Finally, there was just as much of their superior defense as their ability to take advantage of the opportunities they had that led to the home team leaving the winner, and coach Peter Murchie had good reason to be satisfied.
"We've been challenged in our fights so far and still uninjured, so I must be satisfied with that," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "All honour to Ayr, they were better at taking advantage of the opportunities than we were."
Grant Anderson's attempt for 14 minutes, with the target park from Frazier Climo gave Ayr the management, but a yellow card to the Scottish landscape captain Rory Hughes, loaned from Warriors, let Melrose level the position, and Jason Baggot performed a test without a target park.
Climo strengthened Ayr's leadership with a penalty reserve before he, just before the break, scored and the goal park a solo attempt to change the position to 17-5 at break.
But Melrose started the second half strongly, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, with the target park from Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
This became a longer period of time in connection with a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried out on the birch, and from the reboot Ayr management increased even more an attempt from Stafford McDowell, with the target park from Climo.
Ayr's operating captain, Blain Macpherson, was then given yellow cards and Melrose exploited it to have an extra man on the track to the fullest with a trial from Bruce Colvine without a finish field, at the end of a period of high pressure.
The home layer came back strongly, however, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for tackling Climo when he didn't have the ball, MacPherson performed a touchdown at the input behind the advancing Ayr-mawl.
Climo performed a goal park, as he did again almost completely from the reboot, after Kyle Rowe obtained David Armstrong's boxing park and sent flanks Gregory Henry abbots for the fifth attempts of the home team.
Still Game Star is ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
It seems that the Still Game star Ford Kieran is on his way into the catering industry – it was recently discovered that he was named as the director of a restaurant company with a reservation.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC program, which he writes for and plays along with his long-term comedy partner, Greg Hemphil.
The pigeon has announced that the coming ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Klüber is now planning life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he is the Director of Aktriebmorn Limited.
The actor would not comment on the matter, but a source from The Scottish Sun suggested that Kühr wanted to get involved in Glasgow’s ‘living restaurant business’.
«The sea is ours»: Bolivia, a country with no coastline, hopes to open the way to the Pacific Ocean
Seafarers patrol a rigged marine headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings raise a sea blue flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are decorated with the motto: ‘We are entitled to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it."
The whole inland country of Bolivia has continued to remember the coastline they lost to Chile during a bloody resource conflict of the 1800s, and the country extends after once again in the Pacific.
These hopes may be greater than they have been for decades, as Bolivia awaits an international court award on 1 October after five years of discussion.
«Bolivia has a driving force, community spirit and serenity and, of course, awaits the outcome with a positive attitude» said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will be able to see the large-screen event of the International Court of Justice in many different places in the country, hoping that the Hague Court will give its opinion in the name of Bolivia that Chile – after decades of sporadic negotiations – is obliged to negotiate its own exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president – facing a controversial re-election campaign next year – has also put much emphasis on Monday’s recognition.
"We are very near a return to the Pacific", he promised late in August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly take Bolivia's party, and that very little would change if it had.
The UN agency, which held in the Netherlands, has no authority to allow them to give away Chilean land and has determined that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
According to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law, the fact that the International Court's notice comes only six months after the last arguments were heard suggests that the case was not ‘complicated’.
And rather than having promoted Bolivia's case, the last four years may have actually done things worse.
‘The problem with access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration’ said Zárate.
She believes that Morales' antagonistic rhetoric has wiped out any remaining goodwill on Chile's side.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the negotiations on one point or another, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the matter afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative at The Hague, rejected the theory that the ruling of the Court of Justice was unusually swift.
According to him, Monday will give Bolivia ‘an exceptional opportunity to open a new generation of relations with Chile’ and the possibility of ‘stopping 139 years of disagreement, for the benefit of both parties’.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales – which is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America – has used the maritime situation as a political shell.
‘Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean’, he added.
‘The feeling is an opportunity to see what we must do to overcome the past.’
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen unless they can trust the United States.
The North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his country will never disarm its nuclear weapons if they can't trust US authorities.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He encouraged the United States to respect the promises they made during a meeting between the leaders of the two conflicting countries in Singapore.
These comments come at the same time as US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo seems to be ready to launch the locked nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "wanted dream" that continuing sanctions and American resistance to is a statement that will ever end the Korea War will force North Korea to kneel.
American authorities are sceptical about accepting the declaration without Pyongyang first implementing significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, the president of the United States, want to have a second meeting.
But there is widespread doubt as to whether Pyongyang really has plans to give up on an arsenal country probably looks at as the only security guarantee they have.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the last within huge headgear, which is heading towards a clothing store near you
If you want any big additions to the hat collection or hide completely from the sun, you don't have to look any more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne stripped a selection of strange, oversized headgear as part of their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which impressed the motels at the motel in Paris.
Very impractical hats have been popular on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent down their eye-catwalking creations.
Valentino's most eye-catching garment was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a spring-like wide brim that drowned the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included jewel-plucked watermelons, a trollman hat or even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep their heads warm.
Thom Browne also stripped a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had recycled lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the last scream.
One creation reminiscent of diving equipment, including snorkels and goggles, while another looked like a melted ice cream in the biscuits.
And if you're looking for even more big fashion accessories, then you're lucky.
Stilexperts predict that the huge hats may be headed towards a dress shop near you.
The oversized hats come straight into the heels of the ‘La Bomba’, the straw hat with a half-meter wide brim that has been looked at all, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the very impractical hat that dominated social media has now sent yet another great creation down the catwalk – a beach bag in straw that is almost as big as the bathing suit model that carries on it.
The orange raffies, which are edged with raffia fringes and completed with a white leather handle, was the most striking creation in the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at the motel in Paris.
“I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the dress shops next summer – when the designer has had such a big impact, it will be difficult to overlook the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for world citizens
The fresh schools in Scotland are still demonstrating academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another year of excellent exam results, supported by individual and joint achievements in sport, art, music and other societal activities.
These schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools, have more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, and work hard to deliver the very best school experience to both students and parents.
Free schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their position as world citizens.
As an educational institution that can design and implement a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages are still a popular and sought-after electoral course in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, when the words his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, the words of his heart shall come to pass.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the examination results of the year, we see that languages are at the top of the table with the highest passivity rates from fresh coal.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received the A.
The data obtained from the 74 member schools of the Free School Council showed that 72 per cent of the students received the A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French and 63 per cent of those who studied Spanish also got A.
This illustrates that in Scotland, fresh schools support foreign languages as a decisive skill for children and young people will undoubtedly be needed in the future.
Language selection is now valued at the same level as real science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the fresh schools and elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that, for the reasons given by employers, there were problems in recruiting a vacancy, 17 per cent could be attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in order to clarify young people for a future career.
As more and more job opportunities require language skills, these skills become essential in a globalised world.
If you have learned another language, these lifelong skills will bring real benefits in the future, no matter what career you choose.
Communicating directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov survey answered by more than 4000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language that could speak a two-digit number of participants (15 percent).
This is why investment in language training is now crucial for today’s children.
Knowing more languages, especially those related to emerging economies, will give children better opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland, if each school teaches in different languages.
Many schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach in the languages that are considered to be the most valuable for the United Kingdom on the way to 2020, e.g. mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever interests your child, there will always be a choice of language to choose from in fresh schools, with teachers who are experts in this area.
Scottish schools aim to create a learning environment that will prepare and equip them with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future brings.
It cannot be denied in today's global business environment that languages are still crucial for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be considered as ‘international communication capability’.
Free schools will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity and distinction for Scotland’s young people.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

LeBron will have his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The waiting time is almost over for fans who want to watch LeBron James play for Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the Sunday preseason opening game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he's going to play is still not decided.
‘It will be more than one and less than 48’, Walton said on Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trundel wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked what plans he had for Lakers' six-game pre-season plan.
"I don't need pre-season matches at this stage of my career," he replied.
Time of Trump People's Meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President starts a series of electoral meetings tonight, Wheeling, Vest-Virginia.
That's the first of Trump's five planned public meetings over the next week, including stopping places in cities where he has much support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the confirmatory vote for his chosen Supreme Court candidate has been put on hold, Trump aims to obtain support for the forthcoming interim elections, since Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when the voters go to the ballot boxes in November.
When is the Trump West-Virginia meeting tonight, and how can it be seen online?
Trump's public meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, will start at 7 p.m. tonight on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see the Trump People's Meeting in West Virginia online via live streaming on YouTube below.
Trump will probably discuss the week's hearings for the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is charged with sexual assault.
The main objective of all these public meetings is to support Republicans facing a challenging election in November.
President Trump has therefore said that during the next few weeks these five people's meetings aim to ‘encourage volunteers and support players, while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority of them in the Senate and the House of Representatives’, according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible while we are moving towards a busy campaign season," Reuters heard from a campaign spokesman for Trump who did not want to be named.
The evening’s public meeting, which is scheduled to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, may attract support players from ‘Ohio and Pennsylvania, and are covered by the Pittsburgh press’, according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time during the last month Trump has visited West Virginia, a state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is following the polls.
‘It’s a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to give him a raise on the polls,’ said Simon Haeder, an expert on political science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team The United States shows fighting spirit to keep faith as they enter Sunday single game
After three one-sided sessions on Saturday afternoon's foursomes may have been exactly what this year's Ryder Cup needed.
The momentum swinging pendulum is a fully-indicated sport concept, but still something players really believe in, especially in competitions like this.
And where do they think the momentum is now?
"They led by six points and now it's four, so we're probably carrying it with us like a little momentum," said Jordan Spieth when he left the track for the day.
Of course, Europe will have the advantage – they lead by four points and there are 12 to play for again.
But as Spieth says, the Americans feel that they have got some wind in the sails again, and they have good reason to feel inspired, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points of four.
Spieth has delivered excellent games from tea to green, and leads by example.
The deep celebrations got higher as his round went on, and sank into a crucial putting to raise the match to the draw when he and Thomas lay two below after two.
His putting, which won them the game of 15, was met with a similar scream – by the sort that shows that he still does not believe that the American team is beyond chance.
"We really just have to put all the clothes on and focus on our own game," said Spieth.
That's all of these players now.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players who have gained more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who undoubtedly are Ryder Cup's great success story.
Europe's unusual but glorious couple have four out of four and don't put a foot wrong.
«Moliwood» was the only couple who did not want a booky Saturday afternoon, and also did not want Bogey's Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
These results and how their energy seems to float both to and from the lively crowd make it clear that they are the greatest competitors on Sundays, and there is no other player's audience either to secure a European victory as the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Freetwood or Molinari.
Everyone prefers both at the same time, in each of their holes.
However, it is too early to declare Europe the winner.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson hammered up easily with Sergio Garcia, the morning's fourballs-helt, when he was partner with Alex Noren.
After one bowey and two double in the course of the first nine holes, the Spanish and Swedish lay so far behind that they did not have nubbesjans to take back the lead.
But on Sunday there is no help to get.
Fourballs and foursomes are very interesting to look at closely because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give each other, the advice they don't give and how a strategy can reverse in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and is far ahead of the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that the Team United States has missed the spirit of combat, especially in the United States.
Europe is leading 10–6 at the start of the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a strong lead at the start of Ryder Cups last day, after completing Sunday's four-balls and foursomes games with 10–6 leadership against the United States.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led an with two victories towards a broken Tiger Woods, and raised his score for Le Golf National so far to four points.
Thomas Bjørn's European side, who fights to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated America's unfortunate side in the morning's four-balls and won the 3-1 series.
The United States gave more resistance in foursomes and won two matches, but they didn't get back any of the lead.
Jim Fury's side must score eight points from Sunday's 12 singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, and he and Molinari – who together got the nickname "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend – are the only couple to score four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup's history.
After breaking Woods and Patrick Reed in football, they co-operated seamlessly to beat the broken Woods and the American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with even more repressible 5/4.
Woods, who limped through two games on Saturday, flashed into the inside, but has now lost 19 of their 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested for the morning's fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stevensen in foursomes and performed a 2/4-1 victory against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked number one and three worldwide.
But Europe didn't get everything they wanted on this warm day with a light breeze south west of Paris.
Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, who has won majors three times, set the standard for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They got a hard-fighted 2/4-1 win over Spain's Jon Rahman and Ian Poulter in fourballs, and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4/3 in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history has a layer ready to collect after a four-point lead at the start of the single game, but as current holders, only Fury's side needs to reach a draw to keep the trophy.
But after being second best for two days, it doesn't seem that they will be able to deliver a counterattack on Saturday.
North Korea will ‘in no way’ join in unilateral disarmament without trust
The Foreign Minister of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions strengthened distrust of the United States, and that the country will not in any way agree to unilaterally release its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organisation’s annual General Assembly that North Korea has carried out ‘significant goodwill measures’ during the last year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test area and promising not to disperse nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we have not seen any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
‘Without confidence in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves first.’
Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints on Washington's resistance to a gradual nuclear disarmament, where North Korea is rewarded for gradual disarmament steps, but his statement was significant because it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament completely, as Pyongyang has done earlier.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump issued in Singapore on 12 June, at the very first meeting of a President-in-Office of the United States of America and a North Korean leader, where Kim promised to work against the ‘nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula’, while Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has called for a formal end to the Korean war that took place between 1950 and 53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed the call to reduce strict international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘nuclear disarmament first’ and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its objective by coercion and even opposes the ‘declaration of the end of the war’,” according to Ri.
"The belief that sanctions can force us to kneel is a dream for people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions create further distrust.»
Ri did not mention the plans for another match between Kim and Trump as the American leader underlined in front of the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae in the last five months and added: ‘If the other party in this disarmament case were South Korea, rather than the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have been as sealed as it is.’
The tone of the Ris speech, however, was very different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that an attack on mainland America with the rockets of North Korea was inevitable after Mr. Onde President Trump called Kim a "rakettman" on a suicide mission.
After threatening to ‘completely destroy’ by North Korea last year, Trump stood in front of the United Nations this year and praised Kim for being brave enough to take disarmament steps, but said that much work still remains, and the sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is nuclear-degraded.
On Wednesday Trump saw that he did not have a time frame for this, and said, ‘It has nothing to say if it takes two years, three years or five months’.
China and Russia consider that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the actions taken.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council's sanctions must still be enforced vigorously and without exception, until we have achieved complete, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to disrupt the funding of Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programme.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, and then he said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip was not going well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said they had progressed, but only hours after accusing North Korea of having made “walking demands”.
North Korea committed itself at a meeting with Moon this month to reduce a missile area as well as an nuclear weapon facility if the United States of America made ‘equivalent’ measures.
He said Kim had said that these "corresponding measures" he wanted, were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and measures to normalize the relationship with Washington.
Harvard students take courses in getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year will help the students to get more sleep by tackling the growing uncultivatedness of pucking through the night with coffee drinks as fuel.
An academic found out that the students at the world's best university often had no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He started the course after he gave a lecture on the effect of lack of sleep on learning.
‘After the talk, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why isn’t anyone saying this before?’
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep was, and it surprised me," he said to the Telegraph.
The course, which starts this year, explains to the students how important it is with good sleep habits in order to perform academically and sportyly, and for the general state.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and adm. dir. of the University's health services, said that the university decided to start the course after they saw that the students suffered from severe sleep deprivation.
The course, which lasts for an hour, has a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of a room in a dormitory, where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, jogging shoes and books and learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how sporty performance is affected by lack of sleep, and how important it is with a sleeping routine.
In another section, participants are told how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of campus with interactive icons makes the participants think about their own daily routine.
‘We are aware that this is not going to change the behaviour of the students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know about this, just as you have the right to know about the risk of smoking," said Professor Czeisler.
There is still some pride in being able to chew all night, he said, and added that modern technology and the increasing pressure on the students led to a growing lack of sleep.
Some and some good sleep should be the students’ ‘secret weapons’ against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said – even as a means of weight gain, as lack of sleep puts the brain in a state of hunger, leading to constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course, and he took one of the classes to the professor last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course inspired him to work for a course that was available for the whole campus.
Next step, he hopes, is to ask all the master's students to take a similar study program before they are enrolled at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that the students set an alarm for when to lay down as well as for when to stand up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic screens and LED lights. This type of light may interfere with the daily rhythm and lead to sleep difficulties.
Livingston 1–0 Rangers: Goals of Menga beat out Gerrard's men
Rangers probably suffered a loss when Dolly Menga's goal struck Steven Gerrard's team 1–0 at Livingston.
The Ibrox page wanted its first win since February wins 4–1 on St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss on 18 matches as manager and since then left his eight points from Ladbrokes Premiership Leaders Hearts.
Menga beat to seven minutes before the break, and Rangers never managed to cancel out.
Rangers now fall down in the sixth place, while Livingston climbs up to the third and is behind Hibernian on the goal difference.
There may be more trouble in the yeast for Rangers after Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an article was thrown away from the public.
Gerrard made eight exchanges on the team, which did pass by Ayr and into the Betfred Cup semifinals.
However, Holt went for the same Livi 11 who took a point from Heart's last week, and he would have been happy for how his overturned team hit the opponents.
Rangers might have had the most possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with it while they had it.
They should have scored only two minutes into the game when Menga's first passport sent Scott Pittman through at Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle player played the odds.
A long free park by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot at the target bar.
Rangers took control, but it looked as if their game was more in hope than belief in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos thought he would have a penalty park after 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected this.
Rangers managed only two shots at the goal in the first place, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly didn't get any trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's head and a tame kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livis opening for 34 minutes may have been against the game's passage, no one can deny that they deserved it for the pursuit.
Once again, Rangers couldn't handle a deep game from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his head cold when he chose out Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard replaced Coulibally with Ryan Kent in the pause, and the player shift gave immediate results when the winger sent to Morelos, but Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston managed to get the away players to play exactly the kind of fight they like, as Lithgow and Halkett caught up long ball after long ball.
Holt's side could have stretched management in the last round, but McGregor stood up against Jacobs before the Lithgow head from the corner.
Rangers exchanger Glenn Middleton had probably a late claim on the penal reserve, and he ended up in conflict with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: Inventor of the geiger counter
And now a page from the Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, was the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm «Hans» Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, a discovery that led to the apparatus we know today as the geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has been an important part of science since then, and also became part of the popular culture through the 1950 film «Bels of Coronado», with scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It's a geiger counter. It finds radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you touch these headsets, you can hear the effect of the atoms that the radioactivity in the minerals emits.»
Evans: 'Shall it make sound now!'
His Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention he gave name to, lives on.
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells as part of the treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and changing them in a laboratory
Cells can now ‘see’ a protein that is common in many cancers, and are then re-injected in the patient
A vaccine during testing has had promising results among patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, who was teaching the immune system to recognize cancer cells, found that the ovaries she suffered had disappeared for over 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can ‘see’ a protein called HER2, which is typically too many cancers, and then reinjecting these cells into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "The results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 ‘ drives the growth of different cancers’, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar procedure, in which immune cells were taken from the patient and ‘trained’ to target cancer cells, has been effective in treating a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West, wearing a MAGA hat, came with fierce defense of Trump after the SNL performance.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was built in studio on Saturday Night Live after a famous performance in which he praised the American president Donald Trump and said he would make the elections in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great Again hat, he stretched out against the Democrats and repeated that he supported Trump.
‘It happens so often that I’m talking to a white person, and then he says, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s racist?’
If I was afraid of racism, I would have moved from the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's explanation of the Senate Judicial Committee on the charges of sexual assault that Christine Blasey Ford submitted.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording by West was uploaded into social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock wanted to ridicule West by putting out the recording.
West also complained to the audience that he had heard it in the back room regarding the choice of headgear.
"They bullied me.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on."
They bullied me!
And then they said that I don't understand what the reality is," he said according to Washington Exams.
West continued: 'Do you want to see that I understand what the reality is?' he said, and said that he should 'put on the Supermann cap, because then no one can say what I'm going to do.
Try to love.’
His comments were arched at least twice, and the employees who worked at the SNL looked faint, Variety reported, where a staff member said, "The whole studio was deadened."
West was brought in as the last little replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, when her girlfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many when he performed the song "I Love It" dressed like a Perrier water bottle.
West received support from the chairman of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “To one of our bravest: TAKE FOR YOU TO START THE MASSES.”
But talkshowvert Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just «the one he is and it is absolutely amazing».
«But I choose not to reward anyone by buying his music or clothing or supporting his «art») which I mean cultivates and spews out ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
We are too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name. He said that from now on he was “often formally known as Kanye West”.
He's not the first artist to change his name and now follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapperkolla Snoop Dogg has had the name Snoop Lion. Then, of course, there is late music legend Prince, who changed the name of a symbol and then the artist who was formerly known as Prince.
Seizure for knife-stitching attempts at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been targeted for attempted killing after a man was stabbed in a restaurant east of Belfast on Friday.

The protection will be reviewed by Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington extended toward "vigil masculinity"
Kit Harington is known from the role of the swordswing Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy series added to the Middle Ages, Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has gone out and criticized the stereotype of machoelten and says such roles on films often make young men think they must be tough to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said something has gone wrong and wondered how to tackle the problem of "toxic masculinity" in these #MeToo times.
Kit, who recently married the Game of Thrones colleague Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that he was very busy with the theme.
"It worries me a lot at the moment – where did the masculineity go wrong?" he said.
‘How have we raised men in view of the problems we are now seeing?’
Kit believes that TV may have part of the blame for the increase in "toxic masculineity" because of the strong masculine roles.
He continued: "What is innate and what is nourished?
What is mediated on TV and on the street, what makes young boys feel like they have to grow just this side by being a man?
I think it's one of the really big questions of our time – how can we change that?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview he also admits that he will not do any forerunner or successor to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, and says he is ‘complete with battlefields and horses’.
From November, Kit will play the leading role in a new recording of Sam Shepard True West. This is the story of a movie producer and his brother, who is a raner.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that came out of the Game of Thrones is that he met his wife Rose.
"I met my wife during the recordings, so that way something good came out of it – my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygrette, in which Kit's role character Jon Snow is in love, in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14 % increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of a total of 14 % in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, says the Health Representative.
Around 40000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The large majority of new cases are transferred via sex, which marked a change from earlier.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in certain parts of China through blood transfusions.
But the number of people who get HIV in this way is now closer to zero, said Chinese health professionals at a conference in Yunnan Province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV infection through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be high.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men having sex with men, eventually marrying women.
Much of the disease infection is caused by insufficient protection in these conditions.
Since 2003, the Chinese authorities have promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an action to address the problem.
Maxine Waters rejects the involvement of leaked data on republican senators, nyses of ‘dangerous lies’ and ‘conspiration theories’
Member of the House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, dismissed charges on Saturday that members of her staff had posted personal data to three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of the lawmakers.
The Democratic Party of Los Angeles, insured by the claims, was made by ‘ultra conservative’ commentators and websites.
'Lives, lies and more repugnant lies', said Waters in an opinion on Twitter.
The published information included alleged home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the web Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a panel hearing in the Senate about the assault charges against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came a little after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Poundit and RedState reported that the IP address of the source behind the post was traced to Waters' office and revealed information about a member of Waters' staff, according to Hill.
‘This unfounded accusation is totally false and a regular lie’, Waters continued.
‘The members of my staff - who have been compromised with their identities, personal data and security as a result of these unfair and false charges - had absolutely no responsibility for the leakage of this information.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and a regular lie’.
Waters' opinion was quickly criticised online, among others by the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is aggressive," wrote Fleischer.
‘This indicates that she does not have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they have not done, they must not be aggressive.
Don't let them go in defense.
You must not doubt the motives of the prosecutor.
They must act calmly and in a calm manner.’»
Fleischer compared the reaction of Waters to the criticism of the Democrats by Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being overly aggressive during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who works to remove Waters in the intercoms, also aired his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great – if it's true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had notified ‘relevant authorities and the police of these false charges’.
‘We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed’, she continued ‘and that they are held responsible for all acts that are destructive and dangerous for each one of my staff’.
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again – Bloody Rowan Atkinson in spy parodi
It has become a tradition now to look for Brexit clues in all new films with a British flashback and it seems to be relevant for this revival of the parodi franchise Johnny English action comedy – which started in 2003 with Johnny English and reborn in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sarcastic self-satisfaction about how obviously hopeless we are becoming the nation's new export product?
in any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his bulging eyes and his rubber face has been renewed his license to root it for the second time – his name says more than anything else that he is a clear and comical figure intended for territories with non-English-speaking cinema.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre James Bond ambitions, is a mix of Clouseau, a pussy Mr Bean and a portion of the guy who contributes one single note to the musical feature of the firecar theme during the opening ceremony at the Olympics in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the role of Atkinson playing in the long-lost TV ads for Barclaycard; the traveling and international mystery man who leaves chaos everywhere.
There's a great moment in the latest Johnny English career.
I loved how Johnny English approached a helicopter in medieval armor and the rotor blades slit his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy comes to justice, but the humor feels quite blood-poor and strangely superfluous, especially now that the 'serious' brands that 007 and Mission Impossible are willing away have comedy features.
The humor seems to be more focused on children than adults, and to me Johnny English's facades are not as inventive and eaten as the silent film loops in Mr. Bean.
The current premise is that the United Kingdom is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret web network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents in the field, to the guardian agent's perversion — a regrettable little role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last drop of a prime minister, a pompous and depressed figure that's already undergoing a complete crisis of political unopularity: Emma Thompson does a very good job with this sort of-Teresa-May role, but the script doesn't give her much to work with.
The intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy has been exposed, she must pick up some of the retired.
And that means the clumsy Johnny English, who now works as a teacher at a snobby establishment, but gives unofficial instruction in secret intelligence.
English is snatched back to Whitehall for a quick orientation and reunited with his old, troubled helper Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, split with a submarine commander, a hysterical superior lady role where Vicki Pepperdine is a little thrown away.
So the Batman and Robin style of messing everything up on behalf of the Queen is back, where they confront with Olga Kurylenko amazing five fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the prime minister is seduced by the charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve the United Kingdom’s cyber problems: the lukewarm Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their journey with far-fetched sidewalks: disguised as waitressers put the guys at a brilliant French restaurant. They create chaos while hiding on board Volta's luxury yacht; and English triggers the pure anarchy as he tries to use a VR headset to make himself known in Volta's house.
All the stops are really pulled out before the last sequence, but even so loving and noisy there is a lot of memory of children's television with the whole thing.
Pretty mediocre, all of it.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he really gets to use his talent?
Labour admits that they are planning to let the British work for four days a week, but get paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyns Labour will consider a radical plan that will give the British four-day working week – but get paid for five.
The lot will apparently allow managers to spend savings on the revolution by artificial intelligence by giving workers an extra day of the week off.
This will result in a three - day weekend for the employees, while at the same time receiving the same salary.
Sources say that the idea fits into the party's economic agenda and plans to move the country in favour of workers.
Trade unions support the transition to a four-day week so that workers can also benefit from the benefits of the new economy.
A senior source in the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "A political review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
‘It will not happen overnight, but the four-day week is an ambition that fits the party’s desire to make the pendulum turn to the workers’ advantage – in addition to the party’s overall industrial strategy.
Labour will not be the first to support such an idea. Green Party promised four-day week during the campaign before the 2017 parliamentary elections.
However, the idea is not supported by the whole Labour Party.
A Labour spokesperson said, ‘A four-day week is not the party’s policy and is not considered by the party.’
Labour Finance Policy Spokesman John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to deepen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of ‘secular directors’ and ‘profits’ of public service providers.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies are at risk of not recovering the entire shareholding because a Labour government can deduct from perceived unfairness.
He also confirmed plans to place employees in the board of directors and set up employee funds to transfer 10 % of the equity to private sector companies to the employees, which could receive an annual dividend of 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" about the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh might change their mind
The FBI review of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the Agency's findings may cause some Republican senators to change their minds.
In an interview sent on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley in "60 Minutes" asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal something that would change their mind.
Kennedy was more open to it than the colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said at the beginning of the hearing that I had spoken with Judge Judge Kavanaugh.
I contacted him after the charges came out and said, ‘Did you?’
He was firm, hesitant, unambiguous».
But Graham's voice seems to have been cut into stone.
"I've decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and in that case it had to be an eye-catching finding," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett denied it energetically," added Graham and referred to Christine Blasey Ford.
‘And none of them she mentioned could confirm it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything new will change that."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it helped to combat poverty?
This Saturday is New York's host to the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an impressive list of stars to perform and an equally impressive mission; eradicating the world's poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival, which is now within its seventh year, will make thousands of people flock to the great lawn of Central Park, not only to experience sizes like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's real goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a further development of the Global Poverty Project, an international action group that hopes to combat poverty by getting more people to work actively against poverty.
In order to receive free tickets for the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), participants had to perform a number of tasks, or ‘actions’, such as voluntary work, send email to a world leader, take a phone or in other meaningful ways to raise awareness about their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen been when there are now only 12 years left to achieve the target?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way of getting people to fight for change, or just another case of so-called ‘clickivism’ - that people feel they contribute greatly by signing a signing campaign online or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says that they have registered more than 19 million ‘actions’ from their trailers since 2011.
They say that these actions have helped to make world leaders declare commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that will improve the situation for more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group could refer to 390 exposures and announcements resulting from their actions, of which at least 10 billion dollars have already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the secure funding has so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main exposures are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and entrepreneurs based in the United Kingdom to ‘help children exploit their full potential’, and promised to give Rwanda 35 million dollars to help eradicate mis-nutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens.
‘With the support of the British government, donors, national authorities and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice with malnutrition a footnote in history’, Ambassador for Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions in the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced the funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition measures.
In response to one of the usual questions on the website, ‘what makes you think that we can eradicate extreme poverty?’
Global citizen replied: ‘There will be a long and difficult road — sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as the important civil rights and anti-a party movements before us, we will succeed because we stand together stronger.
Janet Jackson, from Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who appear at this year's event in New York, which will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States may use the marine as ‘blocked’ to prevent Russian energy sport - the Minister of the Interior
Washington may ‘if necessary’ resort to the navy in order to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Exams.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria — in particular when operating following the invitation of the legal government — is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
‘I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate energy exactly as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern flank of Europe,’ he said.
And according to the speaker, there are always ways and means to handle this.
‘The United States has the option of ensuring that the sea routes are open and, if necessary, blocking to ensure that the energy does not reach the market’ he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at the event that was held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit that profile itself as the ‘energy consumers’ voice in the United States.
He compared Washington's ways of dealing with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are far from equal.
‘The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuel’, he said, referring to Russia as ‘one trick pony’ with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The opinions came after the Trump administration has been on a tour to strengthen the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, and they want to replace Russia, the least expensive option for European consumers.
Employees in the Trump administration, including the President himself, therefore tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the ‘inappropriate’ project The North European gas pipeline 2, which according to Trump made Berlin the ‘capture’ of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly underlined that the North European gas pipeline worth 11 billion dollars, which is to double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's glowing resistance to the project is only motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
‘I believe we share the same view that energy cannot be a tool for the exercise of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier’, said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with the US Energy Minister, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The United States position has met with resistance from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the BDI, has asked the US to stay away from the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
‘I have major problems with third countries that interfere with our energy supply’, said Dieter Kempf, the head of the BDI after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "think seriously" on his presidential candidate for 2020, says Senator from Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "think seriously" whether she would stand as a presidential candidate after the intercoms.
At a election meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would be silent.
"It is time for women to come to Washington and fix the shaky government, and it includes a woman on top," she said according to The Hill.
‘After 6 November, I will seriously think about whether to make myself a presidential candidate.’
Warren attacked President Donald Trump during the election meeting and said that he ‘went in the wrong direction’.
"I'm totally worried about what Donald Trump is doing with democracy," she said.
Warren has been open in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI check before voting."
However, a poll published on Thursday shows that a majority of Warren’s own voters do not consider that she should remain silent in 2020.
58 % of ‘probably’ voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not be silent, according to a poll of Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% supported her candidate.
The poll showed higher support for former Governor Deval Patrick, and 38% supported a possible candidacy and 48% opposed it.
Other highly profiled democratic names discussed during a possible candidacy in 2020 are among others Vice President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
He said he wanted to make an official decision by January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin points out Track Palins PTSD during Trump's election meeting
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after having worked in Sept.
He was arrested and targeted for a domestic violence Monday night
"What my son goes through, what he goes through after coming home, I have in common with other families who experience the consequences of PTSD and some of the vulnerability of our soldiers," she told the audience at a election event for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of the son and other veterans of war: "They come home a little changed, they come home hard, they come home and wonder if this is the respect for what their soldiers and pilots and all the other members of the military have contributed to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and targeted for domestic violence on a woman, choking with a report on home violence and possession of a weapon while he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the police in Wasilla.
18 Länder and D.C. support testing new asylum policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal test of a new policy in the United States which refuses asylum to victims of forced or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. provided a briefing from amicus curiae (friend of the court) in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged politics, reported NBC News.
The full name of the defendant in the Grace v. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union initiated in August against the federal police has not been published.
She claimed that the partner ‘and his violent union sons’ abused her, but authorities in the United States rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state attorneys who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produce a large number of asylum seekers to the United States, as nations with pervasive problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States reversed a decision in 2014 by the appeal court for immigrants who gave undocumented immigrants as the escape from domestic violence permission to apply for asylum.
State Attorney Karl Racine, District of Columbia, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy ‘is disregarded for many decades by state, federal and international law’.
‘Federal law requires all asylum requirements to be determined on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such prohibition is contrary to that principle’ said the Amicus curiae briefing.
The lawyers further argued in the information that the policy of refusing immigration damages the American economy and says that it is very likely that they will be entrepreneurs and "contribute with the necessary labour".
Minister of Justice Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims as refugees from domestic violence and gang violence in June.
‘Asyl is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political view’, said Sessions in the announcement of 11 June on policy.
Asylum was never meant to reduce all problems – even all serious problems – that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue operation in Palu — double the death tolls in the search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation became ever worse.
"It was very tense," says the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, consoling her feverish son at an evacuation centre in the state-of-the-art town of Palu.
«All the time you see ambulances picking up the dead.
Clean water is defective».
One could see residents who came to the destroyed home and easily through damaged assets in an attempt to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, which were damaged in the earthquake that had the strength of 7.5, were overfilled.
Some of the injured, among others Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, are sitting outside the Palus military hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to ongoing severe aftershock.
He gets tears in his eyes as he retells how it felt when the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves in safety.
I was pinched by the wall that crashed together, I think," said Haris to the Associated Press, adding that the family was in town to attend a wedding.
I heard my wife yelling for help, and then it was silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of ‘trafficking’ by ‘propaganda ads’
One week after a public Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in an American newspaper that scrutinized the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing of using American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred on Wednesday to the annex China Daily paid to move into the Des Moines Register – the most selling newspaper in Iowa – after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US Congress elections on November 6, an accusation that China rejects.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to influence the U.S. election marked a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China, said US officials according to Reuters.
It is true that foreign authorities are using advertisements to promote trade, but Beijing and Washington are locked in an escalating trade war that has led to rounds of new customs rates on each other's imports.
China’s criminal duties early in the trade war were to affect export companies in states such as Iowa, which supported the Trump Republican party, reporting Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador in China and former longtime governor in Iowa, who is a major sportsman of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a reading in the Register of Sunday's Des Moines: "His stairs now up the harassment by driving propaganda ads in our own free press."
‘By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese authorities take advantage of the freedom of expression and the open press that we enjoy in America to insert a paid advertisement into the Des Moines Register’, Branstad wrote.
‘As a contrast – at the newspaper store on the street here in Beijing, you don’t find many dissenting opinions and can’t experience real reflections among ordinary Chinese people around China’s problematic economic course, given that the media are below the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party,’ he wrote.
He added: "One of China's biggest newspapers rejected the offer to publish" his article, although he did not disclose which newspaper it was.
Republicans scrape female voters before the Kavanaugh fades intermediate, warn analysts
As many top politicians among the Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has received several accusations of sexual assault aimed at him, analysts warn that they will have a counter-reaction, especially from women, in the coming local elections.
The feelings around this have been very strong, and most Republicans have already given the sign that they want to go further with the vote.
These things cannot be withdrawn," said Grant Reeher, a professor of state science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona) suggested an FBI check in the last second would be enough to reassure angry voters.
‘Women will not forget yesterday’s events — they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November’, said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn last Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, demonstrators sang «November is coming!» while demonstrating in the halls of the Senate when the Republicans controlling the Justice Committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
‘Democracyal enthusiasm and motivation are going to explode’, said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, on the news side.
'People say it's already been tall, that's true.
But it could have been higher, especially among female insecure voters in the suburbs and younger ones choose between 18 and 29 years, which often do not vote even if they do not like the president".
Even before Ford’s public testimony that gave a detailed description of the allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts believed that it would be a counter-reaction if the Republicans forced through the appointment.
‘This has become a happy root for the Republican party’, said Michael Steele, former President of the RNC (Republican National Committee), early last week, according to NBC News.
‘It is not only about the committee’s vote or final approval or whether Kavanaugh is inserted – it is also about the way the Republicans have handled this and how they have dealt with it’, said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities United States, a group promoting the election of democratic candidates, to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided over who they should believe in in the cool water of Ford's and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a small majority in favour of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41% of those asked were entirely or quite convinced of Ford's testimony, while 35% said they were totally or quite convinced of Kavanaugh's production.
In addition, 38 % said that they were quite or completely convinced that Kavanaugh lied during his diploma, while only 30 % said the same about Ford.
After the Flake play, the FBI is investigating the claims made by Ford in addition to at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford explained to the Senate's judicial committee last week that Kavanaugh was in drunk state when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate exposed his genitals to her while they were at a party during the study period at Yale in the 1980s.
The author of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the author of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project, Inrupt, is a company building on Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
At Solid, users can choose where to store their data and which people have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said that the purpose is ‘world domination’.
"We have to do it now," he said about the start-up.
‘It is a historic moment’.
The app uses Solid's technology to let people create their own 'personal online data storage' or a POD.
It may include contact lists, work lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all are available on one browser at a time.
What's unique about the personal repository online is that it's completely up to the user who should have access to that type of information.
The company calls it ‘personal data authorisation’.
The idea behind Inrupt is according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, that the company should provide resources, process and relevant competence to make Solid accessible to all.
The company consists in the moment of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some leased developers to work with the project and a bunch of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team don't talk to «Facebook and Google that they're going to introduce something completely new or not, which will make their business models completely recalibrated overnight.
«We do not ask for their authorisation».
In an article on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid."
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the debate on online neutrality.
Although he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of Victoria Cross receivers from World War I
The only priest in the English church who was awarded a Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Colonel and President Bernard Vann were awarded the Honorary Ceremony on 29 September 1918 at the Battle of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and was never told that he was awarded the highest British military distinction.
A memorial was revealed by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was a "smart symbolism" in that the stone was to be uncovered exactly 100 years after the grandfather's award winning trick.
According to London Gazette, Colonel Vann battalion headed his over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29th – “through very thick fog and under heavy protection from field cannons and machine guns”.
Later he rushed towards the line and led the line ‘with a large towards’ forward before storming a field cannon independently and struck out three of the wards.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – only a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the grandfather's actions were "something I knew I could never live up to, but something that makes me humble."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid down a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Corps Brentwood Imperial.
Michael Vann said he “felt a great honour at playing a role in the parade,” adding: “The bravery of a real hero is demonstrated by the support that comes from many people”.
MMA trailers were up all night watching the Battle Sports Program Bellator 206, instead they got Peppa pig
Imagine that you've kept awake all night to see the densely packed Bellator 206, just to discover that you're not seeing the main fight.
The participant from San Jose went through 13 matches, including six on the main card and was shown directly through the night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 p.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet each other, the viewers in the United Kingdom sat seated to muffle when the picture suddenly showed Pepa pig.
Some were less impressed after keeping awake until early morning to watch the game.
A trailer described on Twitter the transition to the children's program as "a kind of sick joke".
‘It is government regulation that it is not appropriate to send such programmes at 6:00 p.m., so they had to be transferred to children’s programmes’, said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president for marketing and communication, when he was asked about the shipment.
‘Peppa pig, yes!’.
Bellator's managing director, Scott Coker, said they're going to work on the mission plan to include the viewers in Britain in the future.
'I think we can figure it out for the rematch,' said Coker.
«But it is 6 a.m. on Sunday there, and we will not be able to solve this before Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on the case.
Believe with-- when we put over, there went a lot of messages back and forth, and they weren't exactly of the friendly variety.
We tried to solve it and thought it was a technical failure.
But that wasn't it, it was a government thing.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We will reduce from six to five games – which we usually send – and we tried to reach far for the trailers, but tipped over.
There is an unfortunate situation’.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior to sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up with a inferiority feeling toward everyone because of his sexuality – but it gave him the motivation he needed to succeed.
The 24-year-old says it wasn't before in high school he realized that "he wasn't like others".
In the first program Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he stood up for the rights of the homofiles to give other “hope”.
He also said that becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The usual program leader for the traditional program, Kirsty Young, will be gone for a few months due to illness.
Daley appeared as a little lost on Lavere's first shipment and said he felt "less worth" than everyone he grew up with because "it was not socially acceptable to both boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, it is these feelings of being inferior and different that have been the real motivation and have the power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so that he didn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
He is twice a bronze winner in the Olympics and has become a highly profiled LGBT ambassador. He used his participation in this year's Samveldelek in Australia to appeal for more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he stands up because he feels lucky who can live openly without negative consequences and wants to give others 'hope'.
The three times the world champion said that he fell in love with a man - filmmaker Dustin Lance Black from the United States, whom he met in 2013 - « surprised me».
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you’re so young” – he attended his first OL when he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was hard to find someone the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his whole perspective had been changed.
"If you had asked me last year, everything was about me just having to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are bigger things than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
The son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after having been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had obtained tickets to London in 2012 – since he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't live long enough to sit on the first row," he said.
"I held his hands when he stopped breathing, and it was not until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I only knew that was what I had dreamed about all my life – to jump in front of a home audience under the Olympics, the best feeling ever," he said.
It also inspired his first song selection - Proud of Heather Small - which meant a lot to him in the drive-up before the Olympics and which still gives him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs goes to BBC Radio 4 Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Shapeless Mickelson taken out for the golf tournament Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will beat a record on Sunday when he plays his 47. Ryder Cup match, but he has to get into shape if it's not to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial for the impressive 12th time, was put on the bench of team captain Jim Fury before Saturday's four-ball and foursome games.
Instead of being at the center of the events, as he had so often been for the United States, it five times the major-winner shares the day between being a cheerleader and working with his game at the rank in hopes of fixing what's scouring.
The 48-year-old never had the best turn, even at the top of his career and is not in the perfect form of the tight Le Golf National Course, where the long rough area is still punishing wild battles.
And if the course itself is not scary enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, the British Open Champion Francesco Molinari himself, who has joined with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, with four points below before the 12 single games, get a successful start, Mickelson's game can turn out to be absolutely crucial.
Fear expresses confidence in his husband, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood his role today, gave me a clapping on his back and left his arm around me and said he would be ready the next day," said Fury.
‘He has great confidence.
He is a Hall of Famer and has added so much to these layers earlier, and this week.
I guess I didn't see him playing two games.
I saw more, but that's how it ended, and that's how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for the most played Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never completely reached up to his individual record.
Mikkelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven ties, but Fury said his participation added some intangible values to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, and likes to do geese with others. He's a great guy to have in the room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun trying to get to him this week too, and it was fun to see.
He gives much more than just the game».
European captain Thomas Bjørn knows that his great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjørn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant management at the entrance of the last day's single game in Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant round.
The Danish debuted in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where one side led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but drove to the winner with a minimum margin of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
‘You still remind yourself that we had a great leadership at Valderrama; we had a great leadership at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only so far,” said Bjørn, photographed after seeing the Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and everyone else on the layer that this is not over.
You'll give everything tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you get the points on the board.
We have one goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus lies.
I have always said that I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are very aware of what is on the other side – the best golfers in the world.”
Bear is very pleased with how his players have managed on the tough golf course and add: "I couldn't do better.
Tomorrow is a new challenge.
Tomorrow it's the individual achievements that are at the center, and there's something completely different.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there alone, your performance as a golfer is tested to the full.
It's the message that you have to convey to the players, that they have to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave the partner, and he must also go out and get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjørn, Jim Fury will try to get his players to deliver better individually than they did as partners.
Fury himself has been on both sides of the great upheavals last day. He was on the winner team at Brookline before he ended up as a loser when Europe carried out the ‘Miracle at Medinah’.
I remember every damned word of it," he said in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of the team in 1999, had fought with his players at the entrance to the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'd like to get a good start, like the one we experienced at Brookline, as we saw at Medinah.
When the momentum starts to move in one direction, it puts a great pressure on the middle battles.
We'll arrange our setup then and send out the people the way we feel about.
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the game and challenge Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahman, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other Europeans in the upper half of the game sequence.
"I'm betting on this group of men in that order because I think it's standing all the way," said Bjørn about his choice of single players.
Germany’s new warship delayed once again
The newest frigate of the German Navy would have been completed in 2014 to replace old warships from the cold days of the war, but this will not happen until the earliest next year due to failing systems and galloping costs, reported local media.
The completion of the ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the mastership of the completely new frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, which quoted a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to have survived the marine in 2014, but the major problems after delivery were pursued by the ambitious project.
The four ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered the marine completely back in 2007 will replace the old frigates in the Bremen class.
They are agreed to be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important characteristics include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to apply the most recent frigates for up to two years away from the port of origin.
However, still delays mean that the advanced warships – they were said to give Germany strength in the sea – will already be out of date before they are put into service, reports Die Zeit.
The fateful F125 friar made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the marine has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media mentioned a number of important ‘software and hardware defects’ that rendered the warship useless in a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important since ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are to be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew of older frigates in the Bremen class.
It was also revealed that the ship has a huge overweight, which reduces performance and limits its ability to perform upgrades in the future.
The 7000-tonne heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" is estimated to be twice as heavy as similar ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price tag of the entire project – including training for the crew – has begun to become a problem.
It is claimed to have reached staggering EUR 3.1 billion – from the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems surrounding the new frigates are particularly important in the light of fresh warnings that Germany's marine strength is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Government’s Defence Committee, confirmed that the marine is actually ‘empty for usable ships’.
The official said that the problem has escalated over time because old ships were out of line, but there was no new vessel.
He regrets that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be used by the marine.
National Trust Watches on the Secret Life of Flag Museums
New research carried out at a landing point in the Scottish Highlands shall reveal how bats use the landscape of the hunt for food.
There is hope that the findings will shed light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help to design future conservation measures.
The study for researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common bats and dwarf bats as well as brittle and water flag mouse at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special callers will be located at major locations around the property to track bat activity through the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
The sound analyses of all recordings by experts will determine the frequency of the bats and the species doing what.
A habitat map and a report will then be drawn up to provide a detailed landscape view of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Adviser, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important for the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will be included in the decision on the measures to be taken, such as the installation of pasture land and the best management of the forest for bats and other associated species.
The bat population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has sunk considerably over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and construction affecting breeding sites and habitat degradation.
Windmills and lighting may also present a risk, same with fly paper and certain chemically treated building materials and assaults from house taxes.
You know, bats aren't really blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, they have more use for their ears than their eyes for catching prey.
They use advanced echolocation to find insects and roadside obstructions when they fly.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten competent experts who regularly carry out surveys, surveys of breeding sites and, among others, rescue work.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only own bat reserve at the Three Landersandem in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here on Threeave we have a perfect area for bats," he says.
"We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and the ideal habitat.
But there's still a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive."
He underlines the importance of mapping the bats before carrying out maintenance on a property since the accidental destruction of a single breeding site can kill up to 400 females and young people, and perhaps destroy an entire local population.
Flag mouse is protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them or disturb them or destroy their breeding grounds.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish employee of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the audience to help in the work.
She says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species we just don't know how the populations are doing."
Ronaldo rejects the rape prosecutions while lawyers will sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the rape charges against himself as ‘false news’ and says that people ‘want fame’ by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published the claims.
The attacker for Portugal and Juventus has been accused of rapeing an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was accused of paying her 375,000 dollars afterwards for keeping close to the event, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
When he spoke on a direct video on Instagram to his 142 million follow a few hours after the charges were reported, the 33-year-old Ronaldo rejected the charges as ‘false news’.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," says five times winner of the Gold Ball into the camera.
‘They want fame by using my name.
It's common.
They want fame by stating my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and I'm fine," adds the football player with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the allegations, which they have referred to as 'an unacceptable production of suspicions in the private sphere', according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz says that the football player will claim compensation for ‘demnifications to an extent equivalent to the severity of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of privacy in recent years’.
The alleged event must have taken place in June 2009 on a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga must have gone back to the football player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged event and told her that he was "99 % a good man" who was betrayed by the "one percent".
The documents show that Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that pictures of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later they filed a settlement outside the court because she was ‘lived for revenge’ and was also concerned about ‘being publicly suspended’.
34-year-old says she's now trying to set the balance aside because she's still traumatized after the alleged event.
Ronaldo was on the verge of crossing from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault, and moved this summer to Italian Juventus on a contract worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: United Kingdom “will mourn forever” losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom “will mourn forever” if they lose the status of world leader in car production after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was “anxious” that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the United Kingdom left the EU without agreement, they would stop production temporarily at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the consequences of delayed border crossing in case of a non-contractual Brexit could mean fewer jobs.
The Burnaston plant — producing Toyotas Auris and Avensis — produced almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90 % was exported to the rest of the EU.
‘If the United Kingdom leaves the EU at the end of March, we will, in my view, experience that production at our factory stops,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s Managing Director at Burnaston.
Other British producers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says that they will close the Mini factory at Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is about what the car manufacturers say is supply chain risks for any Brexit without agreement.
Toyota’s production line is operated on the basis of “order as needed” and parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the United Kingdom and the EU for cars made on-demand.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, the border may remain, which is what industry says may lead to delays and a lack of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day's inventories at the Derbyshire factory, said the company, and thus the production will stop.
Clark said that Theresa May’s Brexit plan for further relations with the EU is ‘presisted to avoid such border controls’.
"We need an agreement; we want to get the best deal that makes us, as I say, not only enjoy success at the moment, but that we seize this opportunity," he said on the BBC Radio 4's Today program.
‘The message, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we must be able to continue absolutely what has been a very successful set of supply chains’.
Toyota could not say how long production will be stopped but cautioned that increased costs in the long term will reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a trade union leader at the factory, said that the members are becoming increasingly concerned: ‘My experience suggests that when these jobs disappear, they will never come back’.
One government spokesperson said: ‘We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU’.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again," says The White House
Donald Trump's fateful meeting with Vice-Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein may be “exposed one more week” while the struggle for the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, reported the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian involvement in the elections, relations between Trump assistants and Russia, as well as the possible prevention of judicial exercise by the President.
The question of Trump will dismiss the Minister of Justice or not, and thus threaten Mueller's independence, has for many months nestled under the speculations in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times wrote that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of engaging with Trump and trying to remove the president on the basis of the 25th Constitutional Supplement.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last month he went to the White House, while it was reported that was about to resign voluntarily.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, which was then in the United Nations in New York, would take place on Thursday.
Trump said “would rather let go” of kicking Rosenstein, but then the meeting was subjected to avoiding that it collided with the Senate Judicial Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI check in one week on charges against Kavanaugh, which further postponed a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, attended Fox News Sunday.
On questions about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "A date for the meeting was not set. It could be this week, but I realized it could be a week postponement because of everything that happens with the highest court.
But we'll see, and I'm always busy keeping the press up to date».
Some journalists will contest that claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Program host Chris Wallace asked the reason.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to reluctance to the ‘self-goodness’ of TV reporters, although she added, ‘I do not disagree with the fact that they are self-good’.
Then she suggested that the contact between Trump and the press will be more frequent.
‘The President makes more questions than any former Presidents’, she said and added without providing evidence: ‘We have looked at the figures’.
There will still be press conferences," said Sanders, "but if the press gets the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it will certainly be better than talking to me.
We try to get it done often, and you've seen that we've done it often in recent weeks, and it's going to replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open events or press conferences by visiting important people.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York this week the president showed the possible reason, when he did a solo race and sometimes had a strange behavior in front of a lot of reporters.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland on Brexit concerns
The Secretary of Health has written to the EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS (State Health Service) to express the country’s gratitude and a desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, Scottish Member of Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom was to leave the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of applying for a residence and work permit for EU citizens working in their public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: ‘Debate negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU have taken place during the summer and are expected to land on a solution for the fall.
But the British government has also stepped up the preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I understand that this must be a very difficult time for you all.
I will therefore repeat now how much I value the effort of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and outside, provide valuable experience and expertise to strengthen and improve health care work for the benefit of patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely their home and we sincerely hope you will stay here».
Christion Abercrombie undergoes rapid surgery after head injury
The defender at Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, went through an emergency operation after a head injury during Saturday's 31-27 losses to Vanderbilt Commodore, reported Mike Organ in Tennessee newspaper.
Tennessee State's main trainer, Rod Reed, told the journalists that the damage happened just before the first round was over.
“He came out on the sideline and just collapsed there,” said Reed.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and took him with him back for further investigation.
One officer from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that ‘no information on the type/number of damage is yet available’ and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year-old student, is inside his first season with Tennessee State after transition from Illinois.
He had five tackles Saturday before he finished the fight, which gives a total of 18 tackles for his season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when purchasing a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when purchasing property in the United Kingdom. According to new Tory plans, the extra money will be used to help the homeless
The change will neutralise the success of Corbyn's plan to attract young voters
The increase in the document fee will be charged from those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
Experts in the Ministry of Finance expect it to increase up to 120 million pounds a year — to help the homeless
Theresa May will today announce that foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when they purchase property in the United Kingdom – and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The action will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s plan to attract young people to choose with the promise to offer more affordable housing and hit high-income groups.
The increase in the price of documents will be imposed on individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The surplus – which is added to the current document fee, including the higher rate introduced two years ago on housing number two and home purchase for rental – can be as much as 3 %.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to bring up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 % of newly built properties in London are purchased by people who do not live in the United Kingdom.
Many prosperous areas of the country – particularly in the capital – have become ‘ ghost cities’ because of the many foreign buyers who are mostly living outside the country.
The new policy comes only weeks after Boris Johnson made proposals to reduce the document fee to help more young people own their own homes.
He accused large construction companies of keeping the housing prices high by buying up land without using it, and demanded Theresa May to reject allowances on reasonable dwellings to resolve the ‘humiliating housing policy’ of the United Kingdom.
Jeremy Corbyn has announced an alarming series of proposed housing reforms, including rental checks and an end to unfounded drafts.
He also wants to give municipalities greater power to build new dwellings.
May said, "Last year I said that I would spend my time as prime minister to restore the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means finding solutions for our degraded housing market.
The United Kingdom will always be open to people who want to live, work and create a life here.
However, it may not be as easy for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign-based companies, to buy dwellings that are too hard-working British citizens.
For very many people the dream of owning a home has become far too distant, and the unworthy situation of the homeless remains».
Jack Ross: ‘My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland’
Sunderland's boss, Jack Ross, says his "final goal" is to become Scotland's manager sooner or later.
The 42-year-old shots rejoice over the challenge of reviving the club in the northeast, which currently holds third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to Scottish Premiership last season.
‘I wanted to play for my country as a football player.
I got a B-caps and that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
«But I was often with my father and saw Scotland at Hampden as a child, and there is always something that is withdrawing me.
That possibility, however, would only come if I succeeded in the club».
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland Manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he was not anxious to succeed such established names in the big club, and has previously rejected the raptures of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
‘Success for me at the moment will be measured on whether I can get the club back in the Premier League’.
Based on the structure and facilities of this club, they undoubtedly belong to the Premier League,” he said.
It's not an easy task to get it there, but I'll probably just consider myself successful here if I get the club back there."
Ross has been in charge for only three years, after a period as assistant director of Dumbarton and a 15-month short performance in Heart's coaching team.
Then he helped Alloa to get back from downpour to third division and helped St Mirren from the edge of downpour to win the championship title following the season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during the gambling career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
‘It was probably a proper roadway divide’, he remembers when he took over the management of Alloa.
‘I really thought management was the right thing for me, more right than playing.
It sounds strange since I did it well, created me a reasonable income from it and experienced some fine highlights.
But soccer can be tough.
There's a lot of things you have to get through on a weekly basis.
I'm leading through it with regard to stress and pressure in the job, but management feels absolutely right for me.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do. It feels like the most comfortable I have known throughout my adult life.”

Perfect time for a half-litre is 17.30 on Saturdays, showing survey
The summer heat wave has strengthened the revenue of the hard-pressed pubs of the United Kingdom, but leaves more pressure on the restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars experienced a 2,7 % increase in turnover in July — while revenue from restaurants fell 4,8 %, shows the figures.
Peter Martin, a business consultant, CGA, as summarizing the figures, said: "Consequently sunshine and England's unexpected long participation in the World Cup made July follow a similar pattern as the previous month of June, when the pubs went up 2.8 %, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The 1,8 % fall in restaurant turnover in June only worsened in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars had the far best result, but an increase that was stronger like-like than the restaurants went down.
Pubs with food service were also difficult with the sun, although it wasn't as dramatic as for the Rastaurant drivers.
It seemed like people just wanted out to drink.
For chain-based pubs and only increased turnover by 6,6 % that month, with food serving decreasing by 3 %».
Paul Newman, analyst from the hotel and restaurant industry RSM, said: "These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and major sporting and social events are still the main factors in foreign market turnover.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups still have difficulties, and a 4.8% annual-on-year sales fall will be particularly painful at the top of ongoing cost pressures.
The long, warm summer could not have come at a worse time for food service companies, and the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will give a prolonged breathing room».
The total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2,7 % in July, reflecting the slowdown in roll-outs of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, a trade sales controller for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the United Kingdom, collects and analyses the results of 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of £9 billion, and is the established industry standard.
One of five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents
One of five children – some are only 11 years old – has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers show investigation
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed pages of ‘fake Insta’.
The news has increased the concerns about sharing sexual content.
20 % of the students said they have a ‘main account’ which they show to their parents.
One in five children – some are only 11 years old – creates accounts on social media that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in Fake Insta accounts — a reference to image sharing pages on Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about sexual content sharing.
20 % of the students said they had an innocent ‘main account’ that they refer to their parents, while they have other secret accounts.
A mother who came across the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged others to ‘violate me’.
The research, which was carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Director's Conference (HMC) for private schools, revealed that 40 % of 11 to 18-year-old students had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC Chief Mike Buchanan said, "It is terrifying that so many young people are tempted to set up websites where parents and teachers cannot find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the free-riderists in the Scottish Athletics board
Eilith Doyle has been elected as the board of Scottish Athletics and has a non-executive role in the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated recreational practitioner, and President Ian Beattie described the event as a good opportunity for those who are leading the sport to gain insight into her extensive experience at international level over the last ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world-wide recreational environment, and we are sure that the recreational practitioners in Scotland will enjoy getting her into the board," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I'm excited to act as a voice for law-enforcement practitioners, and I hope I have a lot to do to guide sport in Scotland."
The American won 200 and 400 meters below the Olympics in Atlanta in 1996 and has a total of four Olympic gold.
She wrote on Twitter: "A month ago today, I got a hit.
I couldn't go.
The games said that only the time will show if I want to be restored and to what extent.
It's been hard work, but I'm really good again and I've learned to walk again, and today I do agility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!’
Breast pump ads comparing mothers with cows split opinion online
A breast - pumping company has split opinion on the web with an advertisement comparing breast - feeding mothers with cows that are milked.
In order to mark the launch of what is said to be ‘the world’s first silent breast pump carried closely against the body’, Elvie, the technology-based consumer product company, published a fresh and flourishing music video-inspired advertisement to show the freedom of the new pump to active mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of loud and huddle to a song with, among other things, the following text: ‘Yes, I milk myself, but you can’t see any tail’ and ‘In case you didn’t understand it, this isn’t the jur, it’s my puppies’.
The choir continues: ‘Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my balls’.
However, the advertisement, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has created a storm on the web.
With 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has got mixed reactions from the viewers, many say it paints the beauty of the cornfields.
‘Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to become pregnant and feed to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them a few days after birth," one wrote.
Elvie breast pump takes fine place in an breast-bh (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: ‘Appreciably traumatic for both mother and baby.
But – hey, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?’
Another addendum: ‘For a failed ad’.
Others defend the ad. A woman admitted that she found the song to be ‘unbelievable fun’.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would like to have one if I still breast-feed.
The pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Another comment: ‘This is a funny ad aimed at mothers as pumps (often at work or toilets) and feels like ‘cows’.
This is not an ad that pays tribute or judges the maid's rib."
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have all danced with the disc space pump in the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women are pumping themselves, they say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is fully stationary, has no wiring or hoses and gets fine space in an breast-bh, so that women get the freedom to move, keep the baby and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, commented: «The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing parallels between active women and dairy cows, we wanted to put the search light on breast pumping and all the challenges, while showing in an entertaining and recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump provides.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a two-child mom showed up on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent camp at the Texas border in secret
The number of migrant children arrested has remained stable even though the monthly cross-border crossing has remained relatively stable, partly because tough rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it more difficult to place children with supporters.
Traditionally, most supporters themselves have been undocumented immigrants, and have been afraid to destroy their own chances of staying in the country by stepping up and demanding a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential support players and other adults in the household had to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of immigration and customs authorities, witnessed to Congress that the Agency had arrested dozens of people seeking support for lone minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 % of those arrested did not have previously criminal scrolls.
‘Nearly 80 % of the people who are either support players or members of the support player household are illegal in the country and a large proportion of them are criminal immigrants.
So we continue to pursue these people," says Albence.
The officers try to deal with the children more quickly and introduced new rules that require some of them to meet in court within one month of being arrested, and not 60 days that were the previous standard, according to reception workers.
Many will be produced via videoconferencing instead of attending in person to conduct their case on residence permits for an immigration judge.
Those considered to be unjustified asylum seekers will be deported immediately.
The longer children remain in custody, the greater the risk of anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent outbreaks or attempts to escape, according to reception workers and reports that have emerged in the past few months.
Lawyers said that these concerns have grown at a larger facility such as Tornillo, where children who are struggling are easily overlooked due to the size of the plant.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without sufficient time for them to prepare emotionally or to say good-bye to friends can intensify traumas that many people are already struggling with.
Syria asks US, French and Turkish ‘accuracy powers’ to withdraw immediately
In a speech in the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now within its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, said that the foreign forces were illegally staying on Syrian soil under the cover of combating terrorism and ‘will be treated thereafter’.
‘They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally’, he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that ‘war on terror so to speak is over’ in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011 and millions are on the run.
He said Damascus will continue to ‘bring this sacred struggle until we have cleansed all Syrian territories’ both for terrorist groups and ‘all foreign presence’.
The United States has around 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and counselling of Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in the warring country.
In the case of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are so good that they can return, and he accused ‘certain western countries’ of ‘spread irrational escape’ which causes the refugees to stay away.
"We have addressed the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
They are politicizing what is really a purely humanitarian situation».
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major defence position of the rebels at Idlib has created an opportunity to press for political talks.
The Russian/Turkish agreement rejected a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces against the province where there are three million people.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had ‘clear deadlines’ and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-related Nusra Front, who ‘will be wiped out’.
United Nations Mission Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon be able to convene the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members to prepare a post-war Constitution for Syria and pave the way for new elections.
Moualem put forward the conditions for the Syrian authorities to participate in the Committee and said that the work of the panel should be limited to ‘review of the articles of the present Constitution’ and warnings against interference.
Why Trump will win another period
After that logic Trump would have won re-elections in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, national law and scandals will end the presidency before that time.
In what undoubtedly would be ‘the most dramatic conclusion of a presidency ever!’
At the moment, there is no sign of right of serenity.
Since 2014, the best transmission time audiences have doubled more than 1.05 million at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the best transmission time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" has peaked the cable ratings with a total of 3.5 million viewers on evenings with big news items.
‘This is a fire that attracts people because we don’t understand anything’, said Neal Baer, program director of the ABC drama Designated Survivor, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a well-known comedian and author of «Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club», has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told me he was going to vote for Trump.
Why, she asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh."
There's an entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the actions taking place in Washington can determine the future of abortion rights, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Announcement is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you stretch far to be an enlightened human being when you become seated for six hours to follow a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "deep in background material" for the book "Fear", Paul Manafort's leather jacket with a ostrich feathers worth $15,000 (a garment speculated with hybris", Washington Post) and the consequences of Stormy Daniel's colorful descriptions of Trumps, eh..., anatomy.
At least I won't look at Super Mario the same way anymore.
‘Some of what he does that makes it look like a reality show is that he gives you something every night’, said Brent Montgomery, the general manager of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of ‘Pawn Stars’, about Trump’s varying role crew and daily twist on the plot (crack with NFL, shame Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss one episode, otherwise you'll be hanging out.
When I met Fleiss this week, there was 27°C and the sun outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, Hawaii, but he caged in and looked at MSNBC while he took up CNN.
He couldn't tear himself loose, not when Brett Kavanaugh is meeting the Senate Justice Committee and the future of Supreme Court in the United States is at stake.
"I remember when we made all the crazy old-fashioned programs and people said this is the end of Western civilization," said Fleiss.
"I thought it was some sort of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money from outside flows into the most regular intermediates of the Houses of Representatives
It is no surprise that the 17th district of Pennsylvania experiences a stream of money after a conversion of a convention district that ended up fighting two seated representatives on the same seat.
This newly built sub-urban district of Pittsburg, with the democratic representative Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a supplementary election last spring.
Lamb opposes another sitting representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the 12th district of old Pennsylvania, which greatly overlaps the 17th district.
The map was redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were a constitutionally illegal manipulation of the electoral districts of the Republicans.
The election in the new 17th district has led to an explosive campaign finance race between the main party funding groups, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a scarce victory in a closely followed election for the 18th district of Pennsylvania to Congress last March.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given small leadership to democrats.
USA Considered criminal measures against El Salvador for support to China, then drew the threat
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners threw out the management team to Trump Organization.
Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to recall the U.S. diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of ‘the recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan’, said Heather Nauert, the official of the Department, in an opinion earlier this month.
However, penalties were only assessed against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and death rates.
While internal meetings were held, North American and Central American officials postponed a top-level conference focusing on security and economic growth to follow up a similar gathering last year that was considered a step forward in the attempt to prevent migrants from coming to the United States.
However, by mid-September officials in the top administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, which stopped all plans for punishment against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak to the conference, which is now scheduled in mid-October, to show the importance of the administration attaching to the assembly, said the diplomat.
And the three American broadcasts returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new tough messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesperson at the White House of Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations under the assumption of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learn history
The next nail in the coffin may be Special Adviser Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible prevention of legal practice, which is now very solid evidence in public documents.
Mueller is allegedly also expanding the investigation into whether Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in interference with our choices.
If Congress were to change sides, Trump would be held responsible in that body, in the middle of the preparations to meet again the voters and perhaps finally a jury of his peers.
There are many uncertain factors, and I do not believe that Trump's fall is inevitable – nor for his counterparts in Europe.
The choice of all of us on both sides of the Atlantic will have to be made which will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938 the German officers stood ready to make a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the vest had stood up against him and supported the Czechoslovakians at Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of bloodbath that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or inhibited.
The Americans are now facing several of these tipping points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a hard weather since this newspaper reported that last year he proposed secret interceptions of the president and wondered that he was unfit to be president.
Rosenstein says The Times' production is incorrect.
‘How will we react if the recently launched FBI review of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if it is approved to the highest level despite credible assault charges and dishonest witnesses?
And above all, will we vote under the intercom for a Congress that will put Trump on the line of responsibility?
If we do not pass those tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we'll fail, because of the experience I got in Praha.
My mother was the Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me abbots to light sabbatical lights on the table with the crosshairs.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?’

Rangers' Graham Dorran's optimistic before the meeting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, in the certainty that after the impressive battle against Villarreal in Spain this month, victory over the Austrians will give them a strong position to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A knee-damaged obstacled midfielder Graham Dorrans in doing his first performance for the season in the draw match 2-2 against Villarreal, but he thinks Rangers can use the result as a springboard to get bigger things.
"That was a good point for us since Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game and thought we could get to something and got one point with us.
Maybe we could have sucked in at the end, but the draw was probably a good result.
They were probably better in the first place, and we got out in the second round and were the best made.
On Thursday, there will probably be a big night in Europe.
We hope for three points, but it will be hard because they had a good result in the last fight, but with the home audience in my back I'm sure we can stand on and get a positive result.
The spring was absolutely tough, between everything that happened to my injuries and the replacements in the club itself, but there's a good feeling now.
The team is good and the boy is mad; the training is good.
Hopefully we can stand on now, add the last season behind us and get it added."
Women lose their night sleep because of the fear of pension savings
Although the participants in the study had a clear formula on how they wanted to be taken care of, there were few who talked to the family about it.
About half of the people in the Nationwide study said they talked to the spouse about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10% said they were talking to the kids about it.
‘People want to be taken care of by someone in the family, but they don’t do anything to make that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare the family to give you care if you don't say what you want in good time in advance.
Discussions with the consultant and the family where and how care should be provided, since such choices may be of great importance in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: The consultant can also help you figure out how to pay for the expenses.
The long-term financing options may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these costs or self-insurance with your own assets – if you have enough money.
Develop your legal documents: Clear legal problems immediately.
Get a health authorisation in place by appointing a person you trust to have an overview of your medical care, and make sure that your health workers will comply with your wishes if you are prevented from communicating.
You should also consider empowering your economy.
You choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that your bills are paid if you cannot do so yourself.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your old parents have a medical emergency and are on their way to hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Please enter the details in a summary so that you are prepared.

Man shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air gun as he was on his way home after an untrial.
The victim, a man in the 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, his stomach and his hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a ‘unmotivated action’.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called for witnesses.
Indonesia earthquakes and tsunamis
At least 384 people have been killed in a heavy earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to officials, and death rates are expected to rise.
Communication is out of operation and rescue workers have not been able to obtain information from the Donggala Government, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with strength 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16 000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated the 40th anniversary when the earthquake and the tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a county that extends along more than 300 km of the coastline in the north-west part of the island of Sulawesi.
The government, an administrative region below the provincial level, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the bearers of the economy of the Central Province of Sulawesis, in particular the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast opposite Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia’s emergency aid administration.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also met western Donggala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is on the Seismic Ageing in the Pacific and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia’s Aceh province north of Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226 000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and beginning of April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 hit south on Java, Indonesia’s most populated island, and triggered a tsunami that struck across the south coast, killing 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with strength 7.6 occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake of strength 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai islands, outside Sumatra, and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters that razed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the government of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic while men were reminded of the kings of the mortal earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
There was no tsunami triggered this time, but over 100 were killed by collapseing buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island Lombok and kill more than 500 people, most of them in the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be stranded temporarily.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested after charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former Alaska Governor and Vice President Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29 years old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested after suspicion of domestic violence, laboring with a report on domestic violence and the opposite of arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he must have picked up the phone from a female acquaintance as she tried to call the police to report the alleged assault.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su Sanctions and is arrested for an unsecured bond worth $500, reported by KTUU.
He was presented to the court on Saturday, where he declared himself ‘not guilty, absolutely’ when he was asked how he was dealing with the guilt issue, reported the network.
Palin is confronted with three Class A offences, which means he can be imprisoned for up to a year and fined 250,000 dollars.
He has also been charged with a Class B offence, which can be punished with one day in prison and a 2000 dollar fine.
This is not the first time it is aimed at Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assault on his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is being conducted in Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016 he was targeted for domestic violence, dealing with the report on domestic violence and holding a weapon while he was drunk in connection with the incident.
His lover claimed that he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent behaviour to PTSD after service in Iraq.
Indonesia tsunami earthquake: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The Earthquake of strength 7.5 triggered a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down, and death rates are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake just hit central Sulawesi, north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
There are videos on social media that show the outbreak.
Several hundred people were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami dubbed across the beach.
Federal prosecutors rarely seek death penalty for suspected terrorist attacks in New York
New York federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayvollo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people – a rare punishment that has not been committed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, reportedly used a rental car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he aimed down pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecution must prove that Saipolov killed the eight victims ‘wildly’ and caused serious bodily injury for purpose, according to warnings of intentional intent to seek the death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these points qualify for possible death penalty, according to the file.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury issued the 22-point speech, including eight warrants for killing in connection with money extortion, on the face of Saipov, usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, and a warrant for vehicle violence and destruction.
The attack required ‘significant planning and deliberate’, said the actor, who described the way Saipov carried it out as ‘holy, cruel and corrupt’.
‘Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injuries, property and losses for the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci’, states the notice of intention.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the last time Southern District of New York led a case that could give the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to murder two drug sellers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York, in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being sentenced to conspiracy to perform espionage for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, showed no regret in the days and months after the attack, according to the legal documents.
He told the investigators that he was happy for what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on the mobile phone, according to his directions.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, the police said.
He did not declare guilty after the charges of 22 points.
David Patton, one of the publicly appointed defenders of Saipov, said they were ‘obviously disappointed’ at the decision of the prosecution authority.
‘We believe that the decision to apply for a death penalty instead of accepting a confession and life span in prison without a release option will only prolong the traumas of these events for all those involved,’ Patton said.

Nigel Farage promised to ‘mobilise the people’s army’ today during a demonstration at the Tory Conference.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians should be “feeling pressure” from the Eurosceptics – when one of Theresa May’s own MPs suggested that he be given responsibility for the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told demonstrators in Birmingham that the United Kingdom ‘would have been wiped out’ now if Farage was Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge for May to reconcile its deeply divided ranks has been underlined by the pro-Remain Tories who participated in a self-demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep his Brexit plan on track against attacks by Brexitians, Remainers and the EU.
Supporters insisted that she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the setback – and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and ‘chaos’.
Bone told the message sign-out demonstrators in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Brexit plan.
He proposed that Farage should have been made a member and be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been responsible, we would have been out now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I will be on for Brexit, but we must reject the Brexit plan".
When he was going to explain his resistance to the EU, he said, "We didn't fight in two world wars to become submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country".
Bone dismissed claims that the referendum had changed since the 2016 vote: ‘The claim that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely wrong’.
Tory Brexiter Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the demonstration and told reporters: "I'm simply saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
«Brexit Plan is unpopular with the general public; the opposition is not going to vote for it; it is unpopular in the party and with our activists, who are actually the ones who trample the streets and get us elected in the first place.
Discard the Brexit plan and start listening’.
In a direct message to May, she added: ‘State ministers keep the job when they keep their promises’.
Farage stated that politicians would be “feeling pressure” if they were going to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now about the trust between us – the people – and the politicians," he said.
‘They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to let them know they won't get away with it’.
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want you to let our politicians, who are on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel pressure.
We mobilize the army of the people in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud Britain."
While marching Remainers through Birmingham before having a two-hour political gathering in the center of the city.
A small amount of activists fanned with Tories Against Brexit banners after the launch of the group this weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis scorned the conservatives for the security problems they had with a party app at the start of the conference.
‘These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, plus, for a free-at-frontier frontier, for free trade in Ireland’ he added.
‘It is a complete farce.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren seriously considers to be a presidential candidate
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "consider seriously to be a presidential candidate" after the elections in November.
The Boston Globe reported that the Democrats from Massachusetts talked about the future at a town hall meeting west of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is re-electioning in November against the Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who was vice president of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
She has been at the heart of the speculation if she is going to oppose Trump in 2020.
The event Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters, who have used the town hall format since Trump became president.
A participant asked her if she was planning to be a presidential candidate.
Warren said it’s time that “women come to Washington to fix our defective government, and it includes a woman at the top.”
Arrestation after Sims from LSU was killed by shooting
The Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, police reported on Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the shooting incident that killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at a news conference at 11 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify a man who was observed on the video.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot and killed near campus at Southern University early Friday.
‘Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound in his head and died as a result of it’, Chief of Police Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on the spot and carried weapons, he admitted to having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without a bust and was detained at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Chamber.
Sims was a two-foot-high youth who grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 matches with 10 starting last season.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is aiming for the world champion's title after Stallordra give him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes's stablelords would play a major role in the course.
From pole Bothas got a good start and cowardly almost Hamilton off the track while defending his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove into the depot first and let Hamilton continue to run in the back part of the main field, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes made a pit stop a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton drove up after some pushing with the wheels that made the Ferrari driver reluctantly let the inside side be free after a double passage to defend himself in third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the field and entered as number seven at the end of the first round of its 21st anniversary.
Then he led much of the race while lying on the wheels to try to get to a quick finish and the captain Kimi Raikconen who was as number four.
He finally entered the depot on the 44th round, but failed to speed up the remaining eight rounds and the Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did a fabulous job all weekend and was a real gentleman who was told to get me out.
The team has done a fabulous job to get a good tosspan," said Hamilton.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein during a political event on Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
When the president spoke at an event in West Virginia, he did not refer directly to Ford's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee; instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate shows that people are "bad, bad and untrue".
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that's been going on in the last few days in the Senate when you're experiencing the mind, when you see people who are angry and bad and rotten and speak untrue," he said.
"When you look at extraditions and leakages, they say, "Oh, I haven't done it.
I have not done so.»»
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you been playing?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document--'oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I have not leaked’.»
Hey, wait a minute.
Had we... no, we didn't play, he added, with an imitation of the senator's voice.
Feinstein was sent the letter with detailed information about the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September--but Feinstein refused for the leak to come from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, I didn't lick her story," said Feinstein to the committee, reporting The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, which she asked for."
But her denial was not graciously addressed by the president, who commented during the party event on Saturday evening: "I'll tell you one thing, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continued defense of the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats used the claims for their own purposes.
‘They have decided to take power back with all the necessary means.
You see the madness, the evil, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control," said the president according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer received two targets for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for the Friday's Elite League loss against the Belfast Giants by winning the return match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants got early a two-point management via shots from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie settled for the home team before Dwyer restored the management of Giants.
Francois Bouchard compensated for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third Elite League loss for the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had come back after they struck Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the third session of the season between the teams, and the Giants had won the three previous matches.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford put up the game when Beauvillier doubled the management four minutes later.
In what became a hectic opening period, Sullivan led the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt put up to Cownie's compensation at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants had the management at break when he took his second goal for the evening at the end of the first round.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard rebalanced once again with a masterful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee leadership for the first time in the late second round during the game, and he secured the victory with the team's five half way out in the final round.
Giants, who have now lost four of the last five matches, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controllers are dying to ensure that hundreds of air passengers escape earthquakes
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as just after he died and ensured that an aircraft that had many hundred passengers could safely take off.
More than 800 people have died, and many are missing after a powerful earthquake hit Sulawesi's island on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Powerful aftermath continue to terrorize the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Even after the colleagues had fled for life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the heavily swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, who was on the runway right then, could safely light up.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He died later at the hospital.
Speaker for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to move him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts burst when we heard it," he added.
The authorities fear that the death tolls may reach several thousand, and the country’s disaster response agency reports that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Botong is restricted.
‘The figures are expected to rise further since many equals are still trapped under the ruins and many have not been able to reach,” said the organ spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six meters high waves have destroyed Palu, who will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aeroplanes bring in assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "At all times you see ambulances picking up deaths.
There's a lack of clean water.
The mini-markets are flushed all over».
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "Indonesian Red Cross is working feverishly to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can be much worse».
Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo arrived on Sunday and told the country’s military: ‘I ask you all to work day and night to perform all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?’ reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes earlier this year in Lombok, where over 550 people died.
Fly crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini reports now that a man is missing after the plane crashed in the lagoon
The airline that owned the plane that crashed in a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia, now says that one man is missing. They reported earlier that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a press release that on Saturday afternoon there was one male passenger they did not have an overview of.
The airline said they cooperated with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The air carrier did not respond immediately to the request for more details on the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still on hospital on Saturday, and the condition until all were stable.
What led to the crash and the exact sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just outside the runway.
Some witnesses believed that the plane bombed the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very low.
'That's a very good thing,' said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others were able to wade through waist-deep water to the emergency exit on the sinking plane.
He said that the airmen had panic and screams, and that he got a smaller head injury.
U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to repair a brew also helped in the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to carry people ashore before the plane sank about 30 meters below the water surface.
Data from Aviation Safety Network suggests that 111 people have died in crashes with PNG-registered planes in the last twenty years, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analysts present the timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution authorities closed the procedure on Saturday in a new lawsuit for a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
U.S. analyst in the Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, witnessed for hours as expert witnesses in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used mobile transcripts to puzzle the movements of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers that night she died, which was fighting against what he had claimed earlier, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at the same place as the phone to Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went to the witness book on Saturday and claimed that he was not in the city that day.
When the actor asked about Tellis spoke true when he claimed he was in the trailer to Sanford that night, Sanford said that he was ‘stupid because my trailer was in Nashville’.
Another disagreement was that Tellis claimed he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile printing suggests that they had only known each other for one week.
Rowlett said that a little after Chambers' death, Tellis removed the calls, contact details and messages to and from Chambers from his phone.
"He has removed her from his life," said Hale.
The defence shall commence its procedure on Sunday according to plan.
The judge said he expected the matter to be left to the jury later that day.

Only a black person?!
New York kidnappers suing couples for dismissal after ‘racial’ notification
A babysitter in New York sues a couple for discriminating dismissal after receiving a bug-send message from her mother, who complained that she was ‘even a black person’.
The couple rejects their racist nature and compares the case to ‘expression’.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, expressed disappointment when she found out that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met up with the first working day in 2016.
‘NEEEEEII ENDE A SVART PERSON’, wrote the Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a message.
But instead of sending it to the man, she sent it to Maurice, twice.
After discovering the tabloid, there was an ‘inconvenient’ Plasco-Flaxman who resigned Maurice, claiming that their retired nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she had expected one from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for his one working day and was then sent home with a Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for the cancellation and requires compensation of 350 dollars per day for the six-month, losji-based arrangement she was promised, though without a contract.
“I wanted to show them that – hey, you just don’t,” she said to the New York Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination”.
The couple have turned back to the accusations that they are racist and say the termination of Maurice was the only right, since they did not feel they could trust her after having offended her.
"My wife sent her something which she had not intended to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," said the man Joel Plasco to the New York Post.
"But would you have left your children to someone you had been rude to, even if it was a misunderstanding?
Your newborn child?
Come on."
The comparison of the case with ‘expressing’ says Plasco was due to his wife having only two months to the term and was in a ‘very difficult situation’.
‘Is it such a person you want to punish?
It is not very nice, add the stockbroker.
While the legal case goes its way, the popular court has been quick to condemn the couple on social media and criticize them for their behavior and attitudes.
The publisher of Paddington feared that the readers would not accept a talking bear, revealing a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born just after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It's hard to get in the other place when they read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny to know what we now know about Paddington's great success."
She said the father, who had worked as a cameraman in the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book of a small beard, would have been delighted that his work had been rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book release was 'bitter' after he left last year.
She described Paddington as a ‘very important family member’ and added that her father secretly was very proud of the success he achieved.
"He was a rather quiet man, and he was not a boastful person," she said.
«But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when you have a child who makes a joke: you are proud of it although it is not really your fault.
I think he considered Paddington's success a little bit that way.
Although it was his product and his imagination, he always used to give credit to Paddington himself.»
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone.
On landing the daughter had been rushed to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it looked so bad, that he didn't think she would survive," said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got the phone from Nad who said she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I'm so happy with you, my friend.
I'm coming to you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The medical doctor had given her to make the heart beat, slowly lost its effect and left the system.
She died a while earlier and the organs in the body collapsed.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that it happened.
I could not howl and scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to get together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who now cared about the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers – who did not know about the tests she was going through.
"Nobody knew," she says.
«I looked down all the time and tears ran in a steady stream.
It's hard to explain, but it was there on the plane I felt this overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Postcards with grieving women to prevent bridge suicide
Two women who have lost their loved ones in suicide, work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put postcards on a bridge in Wales with encouraging messages and phone numbers folk can call for help.
Sharon's son Tyler was 13 years old when he was hit by depression and took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parents to experience what I have to experience every day," she says.
45-year-old Sharon, who lives in Lydney, says that the son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
"Everybody knew him on the smile.
They said that his smile could light up any room."
He quit his job before he died because he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, the 11-year-old brother of Tyler was one of those who found him after he took his life.
Sharon says, "I'm always worried that there's going to be an infectious effect."
Sharon made the cards 'to tell people that there are people out there that they can go to and talk to, although it's just a friend.
Don't sit for yourself--you have to talk to someone."
Kelly, who has been Sharon's friend for many years, lost Mark, the partner through 15, not long after his mother died.
“He didn’t tell me he felt down or depressed or something,” she said.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed the changed mood.
On Christmas 1st, he was in the cellar – when the kids opened the Christmas presents, they didn't make eye contact or anything».
She says his death was a great trauma to them, but they have to struggle through it: "It tears up a big hole in the family.
It rips us apart.
But we all have to hold out and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread while the FBI starts investigating
‘I thought that if we could get to some of what he asked for – a time- and extent-limited examination – we might come to some agreement’, said Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee ‘fall apart’ along locked party boundaries.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
The reluctance was due to the timing.
The intercoms are only five weeks away, November 6, if the Republicans are likely to make it bad, it will be considerably more difficult for them to get the man they want chosen for the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has called senators and run lobbying to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and hit his wife Ashley there when she was personal secretary to Bush.
What happens after the FBI has delivered its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, so Vice President Mike Pence can use his double voice and get him into the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean skippers ‘falls’ under Kim
The number of North Korean deportees to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, which refers to data from the South Korea Department of Collection, said it had been 1127 of hoppings last year – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park stated that stricter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher prices in human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang hasn't commented in public.
Most deportees from North Korea are eventually offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flights via China, which have the longest border with North Korea and are easier to cross than the strictly guarded demilitarized zone between the two Korean states.
China regards the deportees as illegal migrants and not refugees and returns them with power.
The relationship between North and South — which is technically still at war — has improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for talks on the locked-in negotiations on denuklearisation.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they largely agreed to work for an atomic-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
‘Without confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such conditions there is no possibility that we will unilaterally calm down first’, said Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is unfit to sit in the highest court
Minority leader of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterically" and said he had a temperament that made him unfit to sit in supreme court.
Pelosi delivered the opinions in an interview on Saturday during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I could not help thinking that if a woman had behaved like this, she would be called hysterical," said Pelosi about her reaction to the Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied emotionally that he had committed sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his statement of opening, sometimes he cried out and was crying when he talked about the family and the years in high school.
He was also strongly condemned by the Democrats in the Committee and called the allegations against him a ‘grotesque and coordinated fall in character’ organized by liberals who were angry at the loss of the Presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said she thought that Kavanaugh's testimony shows that he cannot sit in the highest court since it shows that he is preconceived against democrats.
"I believe he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacks the Clinton couple and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh into national law if he was approved and if the Democrats got the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I want to say this – if he does not tell the truth to Congress and the FBI, he is not only unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he is currently sitting in," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently judge in D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) or Roe v. Wade (abort rights), since he is considered to be a conservative judge.
In the inquiry, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would review certain maximum court decisions.
‘This is not the time to send a hysterical, partial person to the Supreme Court and expect us to applaud it,’ said Pelosi.
And women have to handle it.
It's a fair grief, months and years when the mind takes over, and she can't get it out without crying.
«We cry when we are angry» Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's so weird, do you?"
She continues: "I got good help from a woman who was my superior somewhere, who said that she also cries when she gets angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she talked to "you might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept going.
And that's what I thought was amazing."
Tears are allowed to end in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories from one of my first jobs was in a man-dominated office. I began to cry with unexplained rage and was caught in the neck of an older woman – a cool boss I had always been a little afraid of – who took me to a stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she said.
‘They don’t know you’re furious.
They'll think you're tired and happy because they managed to take you."
Patricia Schroeder, at that time a democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart when he was acting as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Hart was revealed to be unfaithful to the spouse on board a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the election, Schroeder was very frustrated and thought that there was nothing in the way to investigate the possibilities of making himself a presidential candidate.
‘It wasn’t a thoughtful decision’, she said with a laugh 30 years later.
‘There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last one they needed was one more.
Some called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Since it was closer to the end of the campaign, she lay behind with the funding and swore that she would not silently if she didn't get in at $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She discovered that some of the supporters who gave $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount, or?," she wonders.
When she gave the speech to announce that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings – gratitude to the people who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to drive money and to reach voters instead of delegates, as well as anger about sexism – that she fell into tears.
"You would think that I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls how the press spoke of her.
"You would think Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking what they would write on my grave stand?
'She's crying?'
How the US-China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing
The opening ointments in the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and although the fight is far from over, a gap between countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, says experts.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, fired the first warning earlier this year by imposing customs duties on important Chinese exports, including photovoltaic panels, steel and aluminium.
The main escalation occurred this week with new customs duties on goods worth $200 billion, which means customs duties of half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Of course, Beijing has returned every time, now at the latest with a five to ten percent hit on American goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to match the US attack for attack, and the world's second largest economy will probably not lift the white flag with the first.
Making Washington descend means yielding to demands, but official submission to the United States will be too humiliating for the Chinese president, Xi Jinping.
Experts nevertheless say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure around the trade war with the United States can give a positive outcome for China in the long term by reducing the mutual dependence between the two economies.
‘The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that start up economic spin-offs in one of the countries is actually much more dangerous than the spectators have seen before,’ said Abigail Grace, a research colleague who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think-tank.
Syria ‘ready’ for the return of refugees, says Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says they are ready for voluntary return of refugees and appeal for help to repatriate the country, which has been shaved after more than 7 years of war.
When he spoke at the UN National Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
‘Today, the ground situation is more stable and secure thanks to the progress to combat terrorism’ he says.
The state continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions are now in place for voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affected their everyday lives and their livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million acids have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, six million people still live in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime will accept aid to rebuild the devastated land.
But he stressed that there would not be accepted conditional assistance or assistance from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe secures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Europe has won 2018 Ryder Cup after winning Team USA with a final score of 16,5 against 10,5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soils and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the throne when it made the Danish captain Thomas Bjørn got the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who squandered during large portions of the tournament, swept his tea-beats into the water at pars-3,16 holes, and had to watch his turn off Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was brilliant at all his rounds and became one of 4 golfers who have ever gone 5-0-0 since the tournament got its current design in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was turned out 5 and 4 of the lowest ranked player on the European team, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's most top ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup finale.
With all eight Ryder Cup tournaments behind it, the Spanish Sergio Garcia tournament became the most winning Europeans through the times of 25.5 career points.
"I don't like to cry, but today I can't leave.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful that Thomas picked me out and had faith in me.
I'm very, very happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European winner.
He leaves the baton to his compatriot John Ram, who beat the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in single games on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods – I followed that man close in growth,” said 23-year-old Ramm.
Woods lost all his four matches in France and now has a registration of 13-21-3 career points in Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the biggest golfers ever, who has won 14 major titles, just turned off Jack Nicklaus.
Team America spent the whole weekend finding the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played golf with high precision throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Fury spoke out after a disappointing achievement for his troops, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
That was the moment this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We threw ourselves.
The hat off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We want to regroup, I want to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and look forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You just have to take off your hat.
We were beaten."
