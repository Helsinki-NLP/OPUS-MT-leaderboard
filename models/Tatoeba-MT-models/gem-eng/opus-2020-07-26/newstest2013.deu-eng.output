A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
The Republican leaders justify their policy with the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter to be a myth by reaffirming that election fraud in the United States is less than the number of people killed by lightning.
Incidentally, Republican lawyers in the United States have recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the vote.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. federal states are responsible for the elections in the individual states.
In this sense, the majority of American governments have announced new laws since 2009 which make the registration procedure difficult.
Following the November 2010 elections, this phenomenon has gained in importance, with 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states being listed.
As a result, 180 draft laws were introduced in 2011 alone, limiting the exercise of electoral rights in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID card and proof of US citizenship.
Moreover, these laws also reduce the time-limits for early voting, invalidate the right to register as voters on the day of the election, and give citizens the right to vote for which a legal act is available.
Before the 2006 elections, no US Member State has requested voters to present a photo ID card.
Indiana was the first state to make such a claim.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the law of Indiana in 2008.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other countries.
Over the past two years, they have promoted draft laws in 34 states that force voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, US citizens do not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, i.e. 21 million electors, do not have a photo ID issued by a government authority of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a certificate.
However, often more than a hundred dollars are to be paid to obtain the necessary ID card.
The new restrictions affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes disproportionately.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people with income less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the necessary photo ID.
That is enough further.
The students who are regarded as voters, who increase their voice for democratic candidates, are not allowed to use their photo ID issued by their institution in several countries.
On the other hand, the same States allow members of fishing or hunting associations who choose more for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these associations for elections.
Before 2004, no state called for a proof of citizenship for the election.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws calling on voters to prove their American citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic votes.
It is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the democratic party.
In addition, Republican legislators in 2011 promoted laws in eight states that abolished the registration of voters on the election day.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to assist those voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, campaigns to register voters in the 2004 general elections have contributed to the registration of some 10 million citizens.
The measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the proportion of new voters registered in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have passed laws in five other states aimed at shortening the period of premature voting.
For example, in the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of the voters who have chosen in advance were African-Americans, although they represent only 13% of the voters of the state.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter represented only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who have chosen in advance.
In contrast, the whites, representing 76% of the voters, represented only 46% of the voters who chose in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several draft laws were blocked by the vetos of democratic governors.
The US Attorney General has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They could partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, the newly introduced rules in 2012 will undoubtedly make the exercise of electoral rights difficult.
The democratic critics advocate the party political nature of the passed laws and see in them as a clear goal the influence of the results in the 2012 decisive states.
A 2011 report from the Brennan Center shows that those states that have passed these laws make 171 of the 270 votes required by the electoral panel to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the electoral system legislation will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the vote.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Prostatic neonate identification: should the test be performed or not?
The PSA test in fact shows sometimes erroneous results, with false negative or also false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to a stronger reluctance on the part of the already indecisive men to carry out early detection tests.
Should the test be performed or not?
We got the opinion of two specialists.
In the studies carried out in the United States, there were numerous disruptive factors between control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and to make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early recognition.
This study has also shown that if no early detection has been performed, the probability of metastasis formation is 30 to 40% higher in a follow-up after 12 years.
Therefore, I recommend the test from the age of 50 or 40 years onwards, if you have a direct relative who has already had prostate cancer.
In men of afro-American origin there is also a higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as a cancer has been detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are illegitimate.
The patient must really understand the extent of the risk of his cancer by identifying the possible options in which prostate cancer can remain untreated if it does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases it is more likely to actively monitor the disease.
Today, many men in whom cancer has been recognized do not receive treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
They are proposed to be actively monitored and offered treatment when the disease progresses.
With increasing accuracy, the criteria for a decision are defined, who should be treated and who should not.
That is why I still recommend carrying out the test.
The most important thing, however, is to talk to your doctor to determine whether or not he should be performed.
In cooperation with the international Urology Society, Movember has developed an instrument that allows the benefits and disadvantages of the PSA test to be evaluated.

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for cancer.
Despite progress in research, adopting a healthy way of life remains the best way to reduce the risk of being ill with it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if all would eat well and move sufficiently.
"If there were no more smokers, this value would at least increase to 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unexplained.
The fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority for the Canadian cancer society, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It is very damaging to the health of people.
"Today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," regrets spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the cigarette release, the risk of dying cancer is reduced by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, obesity and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk of breast, Grimma, gastrointestinal, esophageal, pancreatic and uterine cancer.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against Grimmdam cancer," he adds.
The diet
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large a quantity, it increases the risk of developing a cancer of a Grimm or of a mast.
Sausages should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have investigated the relationship between vitamin additives and cancer.
However, their investigations are not conclusive at the moment.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found out the reduction of the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly demonstrated.
Mr Beaulieu also stressed the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family responsibility.
"The conduct of an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
Analyze the Higgs Boson
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs Boson has aroused a certain appearance last summer, and this for good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the standard model - our best or "at least false" explanation of the nature and behaviour of matter - but has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists it's not completely certain that it's really the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it is much like the Higgs Boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a major physics convention in Kyoto, but there is still no data to be completely sure about it.
Nevertheless, we assume that this is actually the Higgs, since there seems to be only a small risk of being deceived, and let's look at what it is about.
There is an inevitable law in this world that causes two objects not to be present at the same place at the same time.
It's not possible to violate this rule - and don't try it too hard because you're getting hurt.
Because even if particle physics is a truly strange world, it turns out that such a law also applies to them: the Pauli exclusion principle, which means that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantity state", which consists largely of some of their characteristics.
From this the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens, who are called Fermione, who obey the Pauli principle in a similar way.
And in the other, the Bosons are moving, a bad band of anarchists, to whom nothing is sacred - in any case not this principle, which means that they can actually be in the same place at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure, these Bosons are divided into two groups: the Mesons that we will not treat here and the "power particles", through which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs Boson would somehow be related.
But it must be stressed here that these bosons are not all so exotic creatures as you might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a boson of exceptional banality: the photon or the "light particle", which is the "bote" of the electromagnetic force.
If a particle speeds up with an electric charge or changes direction, the electromagnetic field is "disturbed" exactly at this place, like a pebble thrown into a pond.
This "disruption" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon and thus one of the bosons "carriers of force".
More Stable Field
The same applies to the Higgs Boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, has to be "disturbed" to show this Boson.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must reach very high energies, a little comparable to a frozen pond, whose surface could only be torn by a very large rock.
Therefore, a huge particle accelerator like the CERN is needed - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a size of 27 km! - to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful in explaining the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, they are not all particles and not all materials interacting with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet of paper would never keep itself on the fridge.
And equally, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while the others (as well as the photos) have no mass.
For what can all these research be "good", Mrs. Plamondon asks?
For science, they are used to review the standard model (SM), and they also enable physicists to examine carefully all deviations between observations and the predictions of the SM.
By the way, there are numerous physicists who hope that such deviations will be found, as the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and stop some holes in the model.
One has to say that the latter still has great shortcomings, as it does not explain the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter that makes up about 80% of the matter of the universe (new ups!).
However, such deviations have not yet been found at CERN.
Effects
The impact of these research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there was no such thing.
By the way, in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell laboratories did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulses) in 1962 - has already said that the laser was regarded at the beginning as a "laboratory".
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also be based on all the instruments surrounding research.
For example, in 1969, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his work in the optics.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor today serves all digital cameras worldwide as an "eye" and has presented it with the 2009 Nobel Prize for Physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it means that you really can never know it...
Palliative Care - the best way to die...
Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life with its committee on "Death in Dignity".
The debate will have to be resumed shortly, although a draft law will be prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important topic.
Le Devoir has tried to look at this in more detail.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer, which plagued him, had left him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I made seven years," he said halfheartedly, lying in his bed at the home for Palliative Care Victor Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"However, it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease makes her work: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
Sitting at the table in front of a delicious lunch, he is willing to resign to help with the food.
Courageously, he can even smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medication, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to heal my diarrhoea, as this is humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man is peeping," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at Victor-Gadbois' home.
Returning to childhood is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"This depends on the person's ability", taking a step back, he notes.
In the opinion of several people working in palliative care, major events take place in the midst of these retreats.
Patients who are admitted to the home for palliative care Victor Gadbois are all suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they will no longer be overwhelmed by the doctors and nurses who care for them with so-called "healing" care.
For Mrs. A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die "consciously and through suffocation".
But the illness really made me know my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I don't have any more wishes in my life," she says before accepting that you put on a mask that helps her breathe.
In the next few days, however, she awaits a last visit to her son, who comes from Italy.
At the home Victor-Gadbois you can offer a group of volunteer body care and assistance in taking food.
Palliative care is used if there are no other options.
To make dying more pleasant.
In Quebec there is a bed for palliative care on 11,700 inhabitants.
That is very little, considering that one day we will all die.
Here life is continued under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
Depending on your wishes, you give the person who dies an oral care with Brandy or Pepsi.
Diabetic patients do not have to control their blood sugar levels anymore.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died in the course of the night.
This morning his son will drown out the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help relatives and patients alike," says Nathalie Savard, head of care.
Victor Gadbois is not a day like the other.
In addition to an old man of 93 years, who enjoys the last family meeting in the courtyard and is well supported by his pillows while he is in his honor, a young man of 36 years, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two little children, dies tragically after trying everything to survive.
"For six months three to five beds have always been occupied with cancer patients less than 45 years old," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients admitted to the home Victor Gadbois come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
The issue of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care to relieve the suffering of patients when the latter have reached the end stage of their life, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor Gadbois home and the Society for Domestic Palliative Care in Montreal, are more or less exclusively specializing in the care of cancer patients.
Just this great inadequacy in Quebec’s healthcare system ensures that several doctors specialised in palliative care face the adoption of a law regulating death aid and assisted suicide with concerns.
Since the month of October, a manifesto in circulation has been signed by prominent personalities of palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not efficient enough to ensure that all have a right to high-quality palliative care before accepting to go to death support.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was 14 days of great pain in the emergency room without taking measures to relieve them.
I fear that patients only want to die because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologens treat their patients distended to the last day despite the worst predictions.
The chances of survival of Hélène Richard were minimal when she stopped a difficult chemotherapy.
When I told my onkologin that I was going to stop the treatment, she answered me that she regretted that I was giving up the fight, she told me.
However, she had told me that I was finished!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die thank the caregiver that it has not allowed this request after their pains have been eased by a team of palliative care.
However, it must be clearly stated that palliative care is not omnipotent in pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of palliative care of the society of domestic palliative care of the Montreal metropolitan area, 8% of patients do not speak of pain treatment.
Thus, at the very end of life, doctors often resort to the terminal sedation, which requires that the patient be either sporadic or permanent until his death.
We can no longer pretend that we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to resort to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pains are not eased all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean, "I want you to put me to sleep," but "I want my pain to be eased".
The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship from Canadian health research institutes.
Real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the road construction office, construction chief executives, political parties and specialists of the Italian Mafia tell us every day what they know about a great "system" in which the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unions and mafioso are strangled.
An "industry" that was very expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It is strange how the system has broken down since drastic measures have been taken," said Jacques Duchesneau, Quebec MP and former director of Montreal Police.
The scandal was revealed by him due to a thorough investigation of the misdemeanours associated with the contracts for road construction in Quebec, which the Prime Minister had only agreed reluctantly.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010, he emphasises that "the Ministry of Transport alone had saved a billion dollars from the contracts," because some of them were immersing their instincts in order to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought two mayors down," he adds, hoping that you will be able to "show the tactics behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit set up in 2011 is also making great efforts with its troops to the government's auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the police officers of the "Marteau-Truppe", which has since 2009 caused Montreal's "channelling cartel" to be held back in the artificial outpouring of the contracts more...
In recent weeks, she has carried out a series of house searches and has filed accusations of fraud and corruption against local authorities such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who had just resigned from his office as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
It is suspected to have received several fines in exchange for public contracts.
By the way, engineers of the Montreal Road Construction Office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambia, were specifically accused.
The latter has aroused concern by explaining to the Commission the functioning of the "system" for the receipt of public contracts.
For several years he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to one of the brokers associated with the Mafia, who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Mr. Zambia had his hand everywhere in the game, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals in power at that time.
He also managed to organise an illegal procurement for former liberal vice-president Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts for the channelling of which the costs have been artificially blown up by him
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
The former construction engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes of 736,000 dollars in return for channelling contracts whose costs he artificially blew up.
Other road construction officials admitted that they were allowed to be lubricated by artificially blowing up invoices with false additional benefits by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay of deliberately looking away over a shadow budget that filled his cash with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, which plunged Montreal into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first Montreal MPs to sound an alarm.
As mayor of the town district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she refused to sell a municipal property for 5 million dollars and was sold to builders in the booming real estate market from 2010.
70% Black Money in Election Campaigns
From the investigation, which is carried out in the end, she says that she is "drawing on a thread that allows us to understand the way the ants' system is working in order to stop the evil and to call on the guilty".
She says that the procedure is "painful but positive".
We are in the process of clearing the wounds, but we need only a specific investigation unit for Montreal, as well as a supervision to prevent the return of questionable practices.
How to clean.
Regular.
Jacques Duchesneau notes, on the other hand, that "officials have stolen several hundred million dollars", but, above all, thinks about the role of "mandates who are about the tactics in the picture" if they were not involved in fraud!
Based on a 70% share of black money in the financing of the election campaigns in Quebec, he jokes: "I was told that this is only a weak deduction of reality."
The government of Quebec proposes to limit the donations made to parties to 100 dollars, which according to him would not change the situation: "As long as election expenses are not strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics."
He recommends a complete revision of the system for the award of public contracts and the financing of the parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by courageously putting things on the ground, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages the international reputation of Quebec and that of Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh at taking a look at their own backyard...
"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season you have adopted a new level with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress on their side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements encourage me to improve my game level every day.
And in a game, this is even easier.
Everything in football is going very fast.
But I don't get excited.
Since my beginnings in the center of the preparatory training of INF Clairefontaine until my playing time at Saint-Etienne, I have always made progressive progress.
They thus take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new arrivals this summer are used to playing games very high levels.
You also know that every training unit is crucial.
This means that a player like me, who has to offer forehead and wants to give his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my playing position.
It is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makellele, who played in the same position as I did.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti brings respect to all technicians.
In Ligue 1, there is currently no comparable person, and he is one of the best trainers in Europe.
He looks back at a rich experience and has won many titles with respected clubs.
He was in contact with big players.
I think he'll win more titles in Paris.
In January I had a encouraging conversation with him.
At that time I had just recovered from an injury series.
The confidence he has put in me is also an explanation for my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took us to the top rider's seat.
But we're lurking in ambush.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the eighth-final in this way.
What is the aim of the association in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on everything is possible.
However, we will have our words spoken against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to become the first of our group before Porto, so that we can play back the eighth-final as a home game.
Can the PSG become a large European association in the short term?
He already has the budget for...
In order to become a major European association, Paris must win its title and make a name for itself in the long term.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG will provide the means for this project to take concrete forms.
Would it be a great failure not to win the title in Ligue 1, as this was the case in the last season?
Of course this would be a great disappointment.
This year it is really our heart to dismiss this title.
Last season we were close.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to take the victory away.
We finished the season with a very strong performance.
We have concluded with 79 points.
Normally you should be master with 79 points...
But another team, that of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I think this year is the right one.
Even though the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are ringing the title, I believe we have the stuff to win him.
Do you think the media expect too much from the PSG?
In view of what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We fully accept this.
However, if we win at a home game against Troyes 4-0 and you still find something that can be blamed on us, it is certainly a little frustrating.
People wonder what people are waiting for.
We could never win with 4-0 every weekend.
We're not Barcelona FC!
We're trying to set up a game concept.
A team builds up over time.
In the Champions League we have proven strength.
Consider Manchester City, an association that has not been able to qualify for the eighth-final for two seasons, and which has also been spending enormously!
With regard to the invested sums, you were believed to have a 15-point lead on the game break!
This was said to mean that our opponents and the French championship would be disregarded.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good in the last season, were "bought" by this new PSG.
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in the month of May we will be the smiling winner and tell ourselves that we have finally won them despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be entirely dependent on the services of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
The better you talk about a zlatan dependency.
That means Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many gates.
That's why he came and he proves he's the star of Ligue 1.
Wherever he played, he has shown himself to be a great player and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their game level.
Thiago Silva, one of the world’s best defenders, also enables all others to make progress.
How did you experience the 2012 EM with the French national team?
It's like a disappointment.
It was my heart to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from hitting out a bit of playing time.
I've seen things I've been getting stronger out of there.
Today I manage to achieve good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "Bleus".
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we have to show exemplary behaviour.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deshamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualification group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strict, stands close to the players and stimulates victory.
Like Laurent Blanc was.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the EM.
I hope Didier Deshamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Is this an act of indecision forced on 16 October in Spain (1:1)?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone's been working for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a similar game in my career.
With Bitcoin it is possible to pay and sell without bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties.
Moreover, as so often in these technologies, there is a political vision: the conviction that the current monetary system, designed by bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euro, etc.) and a protocol for safe exchange such as BitTorrent, which enables the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers on the network, some 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
Some thousands of websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After the price of Bitcoin reached a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, he fell five months later to 2 dollars before he recovered today to about ten dollars (the rates are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to world trade of real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "similar to the conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "Credits" that are used to advance in a video game that you can win or buy (and sometimes even exchange back) through games.
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, trade is always controlled and processed by a central authority.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously depositors of the invoice, examiners, money issuers, as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of related data transactions are electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.
Using the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the traded bitcoins are present in the public accounts throughout the network.
The decisive step is to enter this new transaction into this book.
This is done through a mathematical task that is started on the computers, whereby the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, has the privilege to add this additional line.
It is a fragment of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint.
The computer "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole thing is "cracked".
The goal is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number has been found, the other nodes can easily check if it is the right one.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If one user wants to pay with the same money twice as fast (less than 10 minutes) for cheating, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network, and the other one will remain unconnected, as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that has solved the task receives 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but are divisible to a hundred million, leaving a certain margin of play...
In addition, the difficulty of the task with any improvement of the computing power is increased.
The life of the network has already had heights and depths.
The sites that provide Bitcoin services were attacked and the bitcoin deposits stolen.
"The used vulnerability does not concern the actual protocol," says Pierre Noyzat, who just introduced Paymium, which is a company for paying with real money and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
However, cash also reveals these shortcomings.
Important actors like Wikipedia refuse to donate this way.
They are accepted by others like the blog platform WordPress.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the invoice and showed that almost 80% of the bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "Mega closing sale" was launched.
"Three thousand dollars have been exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noyzat, who is also the author of a book about this currency, believes firmly in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His Paytunia system corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but Bitcoin uses to validate the transactions that are cheaper as a result.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented by dealers, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just have to specify an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, says Pierre Noitzat, who assures that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend in rethinking hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal systems.
"It will take some time until bitcoin gets through, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
By the way, in its report, the ECB envisages re-evaluation of the various risks, today considered to be high-risk, in the event of the success of this currency.
We're out of Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the USA are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain the possession of its territory and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting everything from us.
In particular, we punished the Afghan farmers by viewing them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 soldiers killed, as well as the injured and injured.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also of peasants who refuse armed foreign presence, as at the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even though jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbeken and Tajik have joined them.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there when the western countries become more discreet.
The French troops' withdrawal from the base in Nijrab, which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees, which was financed with the aid of French loans, was done properly.
The truck and tank convoys flooded by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
As of late 2014, there will be no more influxes of the Taliban in Kabul.
Since its irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996, conditions have changed.
At that time Kabul was empty and the country was overtaken by war because of the fights of the various intrusive groups.
Their takeover of power was then seen as a kind of liberation and return to security.
The Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the farmers overwhelmed by the organization Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved so far.
Former Mujaheddin, the Afghan government and the current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The most important personalities of the anti-Soviet war have come back to power in 2001.
They have turned into businessmen by confiscating government land to sell it as a construction land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan and thus benefited from the massive American subcontracting of sub-contracts.
They came into disrepute, and most of them were not even involved in the fighting.
As I have heard in the campaigns, people want a government that does not consist of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, as were those who could take advantage of American grants: capital flight is considerable.
The young people are tired of the war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they had contact with the modern world and enjoyed its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is one-fifth of the total population.
In the cities the state schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain executives, will have to provide jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are possessed by mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is viewed everywhere.
An army is now in place.
Are the authorities under whose command they are considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already trying to restore the militias in the province, which will withdraw from the power of central government.
Afghanistan, the land of the mountains with strong local identities, should have benefited from a certain decentralisation on the example of the Western nations, but by abolishing the office of the Prime Minister, which existed since the Constitution of 1964, the US wanted to make it a centralized state with a strong presidential force.
President Karzaï does not want any foreign controls, especially on the April 2014 elections.
However, since the 1950s and long before, his country has been dependent on foreign aid.
Industries have not been rebuilt, there are no functional dams and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; except fruit and vegetables nothing is produced.
The private initiative is given priority.
In a country based on war for 30 years, a state control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumor has been spread that Afghanistan owns immense land treasures.
This reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only on the ground to take power over it.
Without energy to process the iron or copper ore on site, or without means of transport for an export via the mountains, no mining is possible.
The Chinese have almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine, leaving the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) at the huge Buddhist site to dig out and remain the most important employers of the province.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, largely dependent on imports and exports, to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French combat forces was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional assistance: girls and boys, French Institute at the universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic) has been discontinued in 2012 to carry out numerous non-profit activities and measures for the restoration of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages and to be carried out by a small French non-governmental organisation in order to try to win the "hearts and spirits" and to achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions.
These work, for which a large number of local workers were required, has helped to suppress the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased agricultural areas.
What souvenir do we leave behind after military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will help to improve local living conditions, which are often very hard in these valleys at a height of more than 2,000 metres.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from municipalities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to free farmers from the uprising led by foreign groups, according to their own wishes, the continuation would be necessary for their benefit of less, well-controlled and directly related civil aid.
A Constitution With the Breaking Bar in Egypt
It's a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt remains more than ever divided over the constitutional declaration which temporarily grants it unlimited authority, he has decided to put everything on a map.
To the surprise of all, he announced on Wednesday that the constitutional assembly would adopt its final version on the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had given this House two additional months to complete his work.
Egypt has been relying for almost two years on a provisional, multi-modal text, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal confusion.
This new initiative has only led to an even greater division of the country.
For his opponents, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "break his word" and "step right with feet".
On the side of its supporters, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time, which forces the brothers to refrain from their attempt to explain the passage by section to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way of identifying his public and democratic legitimacy while the protest is lingering throughout the country.
After confirmations in an interview with the American weekly show Time, Mohammed Mursi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote well.
As far as the Egyptian people are concerned, with this withdrawal of an overcrowded vote, an ultimatum is put: "either you vote for my draft or I retain the unlimited power of attorney," the latter should, after the adoption of the Constitution, supposedly end.
85, mostly Islamic members of this constitutional assembly adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the Liberals have not responded to the call.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they have turned away because they believe that they have not been able to bring their views into effect.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally.
In order to reach the quorum, 11 people were added yesterday morning, in the hurry of 11 people, deputy members.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that the articles were generally adopted unanimously.
The commentators found it entertaining, by the way, that the only difference of opinion of the day... was expressed in the time of prayer, as some members of the panel believed that the pendulum was not exactly the case of the constitutional assembly.
The text, which was adopted yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which drew all attention to itself, remains finally identical with that of the 1971 Constitution and states that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement had the hope of replacing "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made stricter application possible.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is evidence of their good will and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Pleasant Holiness" responds to the liberals, who regard this only as a propaganda strike.
Because they believe that the Constitution is being Islamized by other articles.
In particular, they have Article 220 in mind, which gives the University of Al-Azhar an advisory function, particularly in relation to the verification of compliance with the laws of Sharia.
According to the Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, this is alarming, as "those who are asked to comment have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
One can see in this the first signs of a theocracy".
The fears of the liberals are also fueled by the fact that the next rector of this university is likely to be far less moderate than the one we are now.
"There is currently no concrete religious commitment.
With this Constitution we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics who have been trained in part in the French system," said Alexis Bluet, who writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
He admits, however, "that there may be a ambiguity in the context of Article 220, since the terms used are rejected in the religious vocabulary.
It refers in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic case law, note d. Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised about the extent to which civil judges are competent to decide."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticised for the far-reaching powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
Moslem brothers argue that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another issue: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the military's wish, the examination of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
Similarly, there will be no prohibition of civil proceedings in military courts, as requested by the human rights defence associations.
The latter also share their fears about the text they consider to be a threat to freedom.
Blasphemy's reality is being maintained, and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for the right to free speech, especially for the press.
In addition, no longer refers to the protection of women, Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch emphasizes.
In their view, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists expect holy places, the navel of the world and a sea of Sole
The Promised Land unites in itself the glory of Bible truths, modern comfort and unspoiled nature.
AIF identifies you as the five most important reasons for a visit to Israel.
Overcoming the Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all who bathe in this river receive God's blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the transformation of water into wine on a wedding feast, walking on the water, the closure of the sea storm and the fishing.
Jesus also appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
Most sanctuaries, however, are found in Jerusalem.
Here, believers go the path of suffering or the crossroads of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The path begins at the Roman fortress Antonia, Pretoria, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the Graves Church on Mount Golgotha, where the crucifixion site, the anointing stone and the tomb of Jesus are located.
Here, according to the Christian view, is the navel of the world, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands at the place where, according to a Christian legend, the tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus grew.
In Jerusalem is also the most holy place of the Jews - the wall of complaint, the remains of a temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people of different denominations leave note there with wishes that are then fulfilled.
A trip to the heights
The ruins of the fortress Massada form the remains of the secret hiding place from enemies that Herod the Great built for his family in 25 AD.
They lie on a rock wall in the mountains at 450 meters above sea level.
Only climbers can reach the ruins of their own strength.
All others take an air cable car to this historic summit.
In the north of the country at 1600 to 2040 meters altitude is the famous ski resort Hermon, where it attracts countless tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can get there with a shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an old legend, supposedly pagan gods lived on the mountaintop.
Visit Unique Museums
In this country there are almost 300 museums.
Not everyone can be visited on a trip alone.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be paid a visit.
Among them is the Israel Museum not far from the Parliament.
Old Qumran manuscripts or scrolls of the Dead Sea, found in caves in the Judean desert, and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits are kept there.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
The collection of works by Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso is exhibited there.
In Akko you can visit the Museum in Bad Al Basha, which houses several rooms of old Turkish baths with sculptures of the visitors and bathers at the time.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are neither museum guides nor souvenir shops.
Entrance is free, and donations are generally rejected.
The fifth museum, namely the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most shocking chapters in history.
The most comprehensive department is the memorial to the children built to commemorate the 1.5 million children destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When entering the room there is complete darkness.
The stars sparkle.
And it sounds like the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Doing Something for Health
The three main recreational areas of Israel lie on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of the three places has swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Surprisingly, the Red Sea is also bathed in the winter months, as the water temperature does not fall below 21 °C and the air warms up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there is bathed all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea with a position of 417 meters below sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise blue water has a high salt content and thus carries even non-swimmer problem-free on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt sun) and sludge, as well as for treating inflammation of the skin, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, and for the calming of tightened nerves.
Touch the Secrets of Ancientity
These secrets are the old town of Tel Aviv, the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city, the famous sea route, Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia, was connected.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to traditions, Noah built his ark right here, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda with which he led a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to stroll through the narrow streets named after the constellation.
Fortuna shall be the legend of all the team who touch the walls of the street with their star sign.
In Jaffa you can find newly remarried couples from all over Israel and even other countries at photo dates.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk through the Roman theatre and conquer the fortress of the Crusades.
In Roman times Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and the residence of the Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
Today, evening concerts and operas are performed in the carefully restored theatre.
Favourites for tourists
When you go to Israel, do not worry about your poor English skills: about 30% of the Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the trip is not taken into euros, but into dollars that can simply be changed in shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city you usually get on the bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a high-speed train and in Haifa there is the only underground line of the country with six stations connecting the suburb to the upper city.
In fact, it is an underground roller coaster.
A journey within the city costs 6 shekels regardless of the means of transport, which covers including switching for a journey of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated in Israel on Saturday.
From Friday evening to the sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transport is resting.
And on Sunday morning the working week begins.
In many cafés, restaurants and restaurants only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without sheds and food containing both milk and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between various dishes with lamb and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus pasta, various sauces, fried balls of pure beans and peas (falafel) as well as fruits and vegetables.
There are no dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
For this there are many well-nourished cats that stroll comfortably and unspoiledly through the streets.
In the evening you can even see them sleeping on the roofs of parking cars.
The cats like lively places and don't say no to delicacies.
Depending on the brand, a car costs between 37 dollars per day (Hyundai Getz) and 188 dollars (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
The insurance costs an additional 15 dollars a day.
And bike rental costs 15 shekels a day.
Tickets for museums cost on average 30 shekels.
In figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and rest seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the USA and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists came to the Promised Land, which represents an increase of 51% compared to the 2010 period, before removing the visa obligation on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" Leads to Moscow: Migrants Save Money for Language
While Members of Parliament and citizens' lawyers discuss the benefits of the law on binding language tests for migrants, criminals already deal with counterfeit certificates
Every year 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Its only goal is to make money for the maintenance of the families remaining in the home.
On 1 December, a law came into force requiring every migrant worker to pass a test proving knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this scheme applies only to migrants who wish to work in the services sector, in the municipal housing sector and in retail.
However, in the future, the tests will be mandatory for all guest workers, according to the Federal Migration Authority.
In doing so, you need not only to test language, but also to test Russian history and the foundations of legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated for both the maintenance and the extension of the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries in which the Russian language is the official language.
It also excludes persons who received their training certificates and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Purpose, problem and protection of rights
The totality of the exams will be under the aegis of the Puschkin Institute for Russian Language, the Russian University of People's Friendship, the Moscow State University, the St Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take the tests in all cities; already more than 160 centres have been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
However, before the entry into force of the law in the press, citizens' lawyers asked several times the following question: What does this really mean?
What changes does the requirement to display language skills bring to both Russians and guest workers?
Above all, against speakers of the Migration Authority, it is important to reduce the number of forced labourers.
"Many people now talk about the protection of the rights of migrant workers," says Viktor Sebelew, Head of Representation of the Federal Migration Authority in Tajikistan.
However, their rights must already be protected before they leave.
Only organized recruitment will solve 90% the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise for migrants without work, education, language skills and medical evaluation.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrant will inevitably encounter people with bad intentions, who will put him under the pretext of helping him into a dark, narrow barrack, where he will endure with dozens of his like months without food and documents and will spend 12 to 14 hours in the day.
Many complaints from our migrants reach us.
"In your home country, the one is promised to you, and upon arrival you will be betrayed, their passports will be taken off and will not receive the promised wage," confirmed Tolib Schwaripow, head of the Department of Labour Migration of the Tajikistan Migration Authority.
Don't smear, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to earn their money in Russia admit that they cannot only master the language of the target country but can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as the evil: Only a few Turks, Uzbeken and Tadschiken can afford a reasonable basic education.
For in their families there is not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy them decent clothing, shoes and things to do with school.
As a teenager, these children immediately seize the first opportunity to earn money.
"It's difficult without language skills," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Citizens stress the following important aspects of the law.
The test only needs to be performed by legal migrants.
If you do not have this status, there is no exam and therefore no official work.
In the meantime, most of the guest workers remain illegally in Russia.
"Welcomed by heart" or "No access for unauthorized persons"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to get an official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be made quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that our documents are largely falsified and we are not registered, and this results in cases of extortion.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," says the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow to journalists.
"Only spare no cost of wrong papers"
Already on the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can have been falsified.
Some fake certificates that confirm the completion of the language test have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Authority.
The falsified papers were printed with an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive it for nothing: Every migrant who hoped to save his tests paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: this costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The fact that the most important direct task is to protect the system from corruption so that the certificates cannot be purchased simply is a matter of agreement between officials and civil society lawyers.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise guest workers who fall through the test for the first time that they are given time for a language course.
In addition, new arrivals are offered in areas where there is no need for active communication with people without language skills.
Interior Ministry Ignores Illegal Arms Market
Share of legal weapons in crime very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior is planning a tightening up of the Arms Act for private arms owners.
The authorities thus respond to recent events: injured at shootings at weddings as well as seven deaths at the Amok Run of Moscow's lawyer Dmitri Winogradow.
Police want to ban the wearing of non-lethal weapons in public and raise the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal supported and promised the Chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Corruption, Irina Jarowaja, that the changes to the Arms Act will be presented shortly to the Duma.
Not all are satisfied that the Russian authorities want to tackle the problems by "drawing the screws".
An open letter was published on the Internet, whose author - representatives of various arms associations - asks the authorities to refrain from "senseless tightening".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very small, said the criminal attorney, Wasilij Lesnikow, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes involving the use of registered weapons were committed during the course of six months in 2012, while a total of 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that tightening the law will not prevent private arms owners from using criminals on the black market.
At the moment, according to the authors, in Moscow you can find any weapon for little money.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior stresses that the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Supplier: from the factories to the officers
The weapons reach the black market via several channels.
There are five such main channels, says a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and in the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that accepts weapons orders
The first channel is the army or military, i.e. weapons stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," Baranez says.
In the second channel, illegal weapons are being stolen from criminals.
Baranez explains that this includes weapons stolen from both the arms chambers of the police and directly from law enforcement personnel.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military weapons camps.
In many military camps explosions often occurred.
"There is evidence that in some cases it was arson to hide the lack of weapons," says the former military member.
According to Baranez, weapons producers also contribute to the black market.
"Today, there are countless private arms factories that do not withstand international competition and therefore hide the weapons under hand on the black market, for example in Moscow," says the expert.
Another channel of the black market is the smuggler.
Many pistols and rifles come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is its own, sometimes handcrafted production as well as a mafia that organizes the smuggling," the former military member explains.
Where did the weapons come from?
Experts calculated the proportion of each of the five channels in the supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
In 2011, a report was written by the Problem Analysis Centre and the State administration.
The experts analysed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, Criminological Literature and publicly available data on weapons portals.
According to the investigators, the majority of the illegal weapons originate from the army and the law enforcement authorities.
Half of all the weapons on the black market were there because of the "indebtedness of those responsible who have come to deal with weapons in their work," says the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from conflict areas, 14% come from thefts in the production of weapons, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant to a gun store who does not want to be named by name ensures that weapons found in illegal excavations have not been bought for a long time since they are outdated.
According to him, it is more often for dealers to get the supply in a weapons warehouse.
A gun, for example a gun of type TT, is purchased via a handgun.
The weapon is displayed and handed over by the fence.
"The dealer takes the gun to the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says.
"The police, of course, are aware of everything and therefore, if they are unable to comply with the plan to detect crime, carry out periodic checks on dealers who offer illegal weapons," the sales consultant adds.
"Like in luxury store"
Buyers and sellers find most of the information about acquaintances with each other.
I had looked at websites and blogs when someone became aware of me and suggested to me come to the "Begowaja" station, where a person would wait for me, which brought me to a certain place, where we could then negotiate the price.
The price for the weapon I only got there
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a gun, I need a friend who has contacts," says the sales consultant. "I have such a friend, but I don't trust him."
There are dealers in the markets, but you have to go there and get a code like "by Ivan Ivanovitsch, who lets the daughter lose a tooth".
I even get to a few punching rings at the moment about a friend I trust.
He also gives me the punching rings because he knows I'm not paving him.
Newcomers are looking for weapons on different paths.
Former military member Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on this subject.
According to him, the schematics have not changed.
He was given a photo album in which "all possible" was depicted.
"I felt like I was in the luxury store," the military member recalls.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything out.
As a potential customer, I'm not just buying, but driving with the seller into the forest, and there we set up a target.
"I can shoot there, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we negotiate with each other," the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for various purposes".
There is no need for any papers or there are personal meetings.
"You only need the right amount of money," says the advertisement on the website "Buy a Gun or Gun".
There users give up your orders and make inquiries.
Are minors also sold?
"Of course without a license", user asks "Iwan" (literally).
"Buy a TT Moscow", is the laconic request from "Fedorenkow".
The Federal Security Service recently turned on countless shining websites, and buyers who want to acquire weapons go to the network.
People come like hungry fish when feeding and then land in Siberia and may shovel coal
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The persons responsible accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money via a vending machine.
"As an answer he receives a photo and a description of the hiding of the weapon," reports the press spokesperson of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitrij Kislow.
Viktor Baranez stresses that you can also go out empty and get behind bars when you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently turned on countless shining websites, and buyers who want to acquire weapons go to the network.
"People come like hungry fish when feeding and then land in the Siberian labour camp and may scavenge coal," he says.
A Makarov for $100
According to experts, when buying illegal firearms, prices range from 100 to 900 US dollars.
According to Dmitrij Kislow from the organization "Pravo na oryzhie", you can buy a gun of the type Makarov for between 100 and 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to one and a half months.
The weapon is issued in military weapons camps by middle rank overseers.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, the number of crimes involving illegal weapons all over Russia decreased 7% to 22.9 thousand between January and October 2011, while the number of cases of theft and extortion related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives dropped by 7.8%.
Fast food and supermarket workers strike in the USA
Every fourth American youth will eventually be behind McDonald's checkout
In recent days there have been massive protests across the United States against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants of popular fast-food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can yet predict whether the protests will continue to swell or whether they will soon go out again.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organisations.
In addition to increasing modest wages by simple Walmart and Fast Food workers, protest organizers pursue the goal of establishing trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy is hardly organized as a trade union.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, at which sales took place in the United States, attracting millions of customers, which sometimes led to handcuffs.
On this day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, laid down their work and strangled along with trade unions and left activists branches of the chain, whose target group are persons of low and medium income.
Walmart sells all products, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The product in the Walmart file is on average between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many of the low-paid Walmart workers buy only at their own workplace.
The prices and product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the USA.
According to critics, Walmart can often only sell the goods so cheaply because the employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as missing forklifts or hand scanners.
The participants of the protests at the Black Friday demanded wage increases and expressed their anger that the contribution to the company's health insurance had increased from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
A typical Walmart employee, who earns $9.5 an hour, could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the California University in Berkeley prove that if the company increased the average wage to 12 dollars an hour, it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars.
That's about 1.1% more than they donate for pay now.
If Walmart switched the wage increases completely to customers, each purchase cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
This would be $12.39 per year for them compared to today's additional expenditure.
Proponents of Walmart are pleased to note that only in nine states there were protests and they did not cause any losses to the company.
The Black Friday lasted the next day at his store from 8 a.m. on Thursday to midnight, and during this period Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In total, the Walmart cashier carried out nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The spokesperson of the company, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-wing Huffington Post that overall "less than five" Walmart employees laid down the work and the protest action was merely "a further PR trick" of the union that organized the protests.
"Free cashier!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal, however, was not Walmart-Filials (which are not wanted in this advanced city and are therefore not yet present), but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of portions, and yet you don't get sick days, and you won't be paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council member
At present, the minimum wage according to federal and New York legislation is $7.25 an hour.
In fast-food restaurants the minimum wage is gradually raised, but not too strong, and on average their simple staff in New York get 8.90 US dollars an hour.
Less than she deserves nobody in this expensive city.
As it is possible to get out of New York with as little money as possible, I am incomprehensible.
There was a time when almost a quarter of all American youths were at McDonald's after school, but the young people were still living with their parents.
Almost one saw the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
With interviews with McDonald's employees, I now meet people who are constantly complaining that they have to get out of this pay and even feed their children sometimes.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Forum of the Wall Street Journal, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
The protesters who started on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. in front of McDonald's in 40th Street and in Madison Avenue demanded that the cashiers and chefs of fast-food restaurants receive a minimum wage of 15 US dollars an hour, which is more than a double of the current minimum wage.
They continued to demand the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry.
The U.S. law prohibits corporate governance from preventing this goal and from dismissing or dismissing trade union members.
On the other hand, corporate governance does not make it easy for them.
The establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry is difficult, however, for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high personnel fluctuation.
Unsatisfied
Loud protests took place this day before many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the protests was a meeting at lunchtime before McDonald's at Times Square, where some local Democrats spoke, including City Councillor Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and yet you don't get sick, and you won't be paid for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayor candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should support the fast-food workers together so that they can get a fair wage and reach the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!".
According to the New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the US fast-food industry.
However, there were only a few hundred people on site, not all of whom work in the fast-food industry at Weitem, where tens of thousands work in New York.
It is not yet worth noting whether the spark of these protests will mobilize all the masses.
"Until now, the brain can only be slightly improved"
The topic of expanded reality popular with modern technology fans has recently been usually perceived by the lens of a special spectacle.
At his annual conference, Google first presented a working model in the summer, and in November it became known that Microsoft had filed an appropriate patent.
In conversation with the head of the Group for Interactive 3D Technologies at the Microsoft Laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, however, it becomes clear that the glasses for the company’s scientists were only a passage station.
It stimulates the ability to manipulate virtual objects in the air with just hands and create virtual areas.
- Please describe briefly what research your group is doing.
- We are dealing with the interaction of man and machine, but we want to expand the limits of this interaction.
So far, mankind has largely remained in the phase, working with pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes touched.
However, we want to look ahead for 5-10 years and anticipate the radical changes of this interaction.
For example, the Xbox consoles and the Kinect sensors are progressing, and nowadays no more Xbox is sold without Kinect since everyone is interested in motion control.
- What do we expect in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, much is still happening on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the output has not yet been decisive.
We try to change this, work on real three-dimensional display systems based on various technologies, including projections.
We have to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more fascinating.
But for this it is necessary that not only the user, but also his environment is recognized.
Then we could complete the real world much easier with virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about speech control?
She's popular, but isn't she overrated?
- It is certainly not the all-purpose solution, as it raises questions about privacy, because one does not always want to inform everyone about its actions and intentions.
Actually, any type of interaction with computers is good, but each one in its particular niche.
For example, in the area of controlling objects in public places, we worked on a project where we experimented with short and short gestures instead of with unloading gestures.
The gestures were recorded not by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but theoretically it could be reduced to the size of a watch.
But overall, the future belongs to mixed types of control, such as gesticism and language.
- How's that?
- We'd ask you, for example, to supply you with this sprudeldosis?
They say it and at the same time point it out.
- Normally, I'll just say it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to recognize.
- Does that mean that you want the user to adapt to what a machine can do at the respective time and what doesn't?
- Not necessarily, but this is about mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the next period we will have to work mainly on the development of new sensor types, which will enable people's reactions to be detected more precisely.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- What requirements do you place on modern cameras based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors?
Does it lack resolution, depth, or anything else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the area of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
So seen, all current technologies are not good enough for us because the developers of the algorithms have more work.
It must be taken into account not only the resolution along the X and Y but also along the Z axis.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
The human movements are extremely dynamic and openly speaking, the present 30 fps are particularly too little for gestures.
Stephen Bethishes developed a touch sensor in our Redmond laboratory with a adjustable processing delay between 1 and 100 milliseconds, where today's commercial sensors are closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this influences the interaction between man and machine.
For my work I needed just such a device, only without touch control and with more images per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect currently works with three "Cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the depth of the object.
More cameras might solve the problem...
Or reinforce the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
It would be nice to have a flexible, Kinect-like system where we could play with different camera tendencies to see how this helps us in finding a position.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft did not present its glasses to the public as opposed to Google.
Don't you think the glasses have the best prospects for using the advanced reality technology in everyday life?
- Of course, it is not pleasant to always keep a smartphone in the raised hand, but I think the best option would be a "changing" extended reality in which we could switch over a cloud from glasses to smartphone,
The glasses are a personal gadget and their strength (private ones can only be seen), but at the same time their weakness, because an extended reality by glasses prevents you from working on virtual objects together with others.
- Let us imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is not only accessible to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to normal mortals.
There is a problem that critics often point to: there is no sensitive reaction!
Hands don't feel anything at all!
What answers does your group want to give to this objection?
- In my lectures I often speak of the expanded reality as the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as a slightly unusual projection material.
She's got pressure coming out of her head!
But there are also technologies that are actually designed to give the "pictures in the air" something hand-resistant, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasound rays at a certain point where the finger is located creates a feeling that is still so weak at the moment as someone breathed over the handballs.
There are also bands for the wrist that affect the nerve endings in the fingers, also that is a potential direction.
- Have you tried to outsmart the brain?
It makes me think that it feels what it should feel when it sees something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried it yet.
Here is another task, with which we will have to fight for a long time, namely to let a person who is physically in a closed space believe, he is located instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), mobile platforms and large balls.
So far, the brain can only be slightly exceeded, and there are many years of work ahead.
This is exactly what makes working in the field of virtual reality so attractive to a researcher: on many topics we are only at the beginning.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburger Avantgarde", dedicated to city dwellers who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
On the read list, already high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene landed, whose successes go beyond the borders of the city and often find recognition in Europe, without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the red-dressed beards, once at the Russian Museum, sometimes at the summer garden, sometimes at the scene meeting or at Vernissagen.
Wherever the pictures of Kirill Miller are displayed, they attract large masses of people.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a shining personality of the Petersburg avant-garde at the end of the 1980s and early 1990s.
He is also a man of the city and, through his presence on the street, enchants his fellow citizens with a smile in the face and gives them a good mood.
A short time ago, he grabbed a rotating organ and became a Petersburg rotary organ player, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role with regard to his artist presence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, in yellow or turquoise in the city?
I have chosen the color Red as a fashion designer that deals with the optics and the image.
In this world, Red is the compromise between artists, image advisors and society.
In society, everything that deviates from the norm produces aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Each of my previous provocations was an invitation to talk.
- When did you know you had to be a painter?
- At an exhibition in the Newskij Cultural Palace, where my works were exhibited.
I understand I have to go this way.
Then the time of the old free, but not officially recognized painters ended then, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I was friends with the painters of the new generation, that is, with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina", from which "Puschkinskaya 10" was born, and then it was over.
It draws me to the theatre, to fashion, to music, actually to everything except literature.
It was important for me to be at the heart of Petersburg's culture, where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995 I occupied a room in Puschkinskaya 10, where, until the renovation work, there was a musical-artistic club for the Bohemian, the house of the Petersburg Bohemian Bohemia.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how Schnur came there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Schnur and his friends sang simple songs to the play-back, wore tight jerseys and belonged to the composer Igor Wdovin today.
When the group started to play live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began his great career, but he learned the basics with us.
The gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" also originates in art clinical practice.
Our staff and regulars went there.
I'm a hero of the past century, when culture meant something.
In 2000 there was a survey in the press about the award "Personalities of Our City".
I won in the category "Artists of the Year", and with that I had reached the peak.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a person of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In modern times it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: one can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unmistakable style.
- Many of my pictures are true pearls and clearly express the topicality and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and makes me afraid to be like that.
In a clown, it blurs everything and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
Let us save the world, for example, by requiring everyone to dress up completely.
Now everyone pays attention to the clothes and is oriented to the outer and not the inside of man.
But maybe you can't give a man a hand, but you should spit in his face.
The deception disappears through the disguise.
- We recently saw you in the role of the city organ player. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
Who, if not me?
- Can commercial art be beautiful?
- Nowadays, commercial art must be careful, considerate and flattering.
We see the decay of cultures.
People used to form large groups: Bohemia's loved one and the simple people loved the other.
Now there are micro-communitys, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a one-hundred dollar note everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you're gonna like.
Now every cult star has about 100 followers.
- Stas Michailow's appearances come but several thousand!
- abandoned women come to him, there the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons there are 300 people and not 10 thousand, so there is less management, money, and everything goes down.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat them and not to destroy what was accomplished.
In my youth, I painted such pictures that were even hung by a collector in a series of works by Falk and Larionow.
I started with pictures that usually come only at the end of my career.
Nowadays, there are often misunderstandings.
It means spiritual culture and consumption culture.
Konsum has no culture at all, that's something completely different.
I am a person of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to paint.
That is the culture I advocate.
- Kirill, what's missing in Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
They say: Servants of culture.
But not every one of them can deal with culture.
With the real tsars it was different, because the tsars may not understand much of culture, but they understood that right experts are necessary.
There are currently good consultants in Moscow.
In Petersburg, we have those who could be the experts, but they are being blocked by the way, as higher-ranking experts need to assess the former correctly and clear the way for them.
Now counts only its own taste.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters therefore have to look for other museums.
- What's Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the cultural capital; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding breeding ground.
Art can only grow hard on our stones.
We need a cultural breeding ground, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
It's a lot less with us.
Art must be modern again, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is financed from grants from the city of St Petersburg
Birth in the World
Earth in danger.
Earth warming or colliding with killerasteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with earthlings on board are looking for a replacement planet.
To save mankind, does the important question arise as to how we can reproduce in gravity or on the substitute planet?
In my opinion, there are not many choices.
De facto there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
"Nearly Mars and Venus," says the scientific assistant of the Astronomical Sternberg Institute Vladimir Surdin.
While the conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, on the surface of Venus there is a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would only be possible in a large height or in the orbit of Venus, i.e. in space.
The researchers first dealt with the question of reproduction in all terms with regard to the flora.
Already half a century before, experiments were carried out with plants.
The fourth generation of the orbit-bred peas did not differ in the least from the earthly species.
It followed the breeding of insects, more precisely of tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in the orbit.
In 1979, quail lodgers were sent to the world to investigate how gravity affects the development of Embryos.
It develops a very normal chick.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chick needs to stop; it needs to be able to stand on its legs and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychew, head of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems.
Without solid ground, the chicks crossed wildly.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns subsided completely.
The chicks did not react to light and sounds.
Four days later, they just died.
"Twice we let chicks slip and put the whole thing in, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," Vladimir Sychev notes to the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last cage with animals flew into the orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, only gender species will be found on the biosatellite "Bion".
There was an experiment with rats that were already fertilized into space.
In principle, nothing special has been identified.
"This was just with the biosatellites, but again it was only a single experiment, and the research needs to be continued," says Vladimir Sychew.
After the landing, the Space Councils grew up.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been solved.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are torn from their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive drive.
Unlike animals, man could do that in principle.
The homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying all over for 50 years.
Tereschkowa was the biggest risk.
The most valuable possession of mankind is the female organism.
Our mouths flew from it, and no one on earth could have answered this question: Can they survive the space flight?
Will she be able to bring a child to the world after this flight?
"Finally, no one answered this question," says Raumfahrtveteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, only one year after her space flight, the first female Cosmonautin, Valentina Tereschkowa, bore a daughter.
The child's father, Andriyan Nikolayev, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988 the second woman in the All, Svetlana Sawizkaja, who was twice in the orbit and even did work outside the spacecraft, bore a son.
Nevertheless, there is still a risk.
We have very few cosmonauts, where after long flights everything went well and they got healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even for flights into the Orbit", concludes Cosmonaut Waleri Polyakow, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
Yet humanity must look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and producing artificial gravitation.
The Hydrolabor in the Cosmonaut Preparation Centre is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here in a state of silence, the Cosmonauts win routines for working in open space.
The water represents gravity.
Even though adults feel that water is pleasant, it is a foreign environment; but infants feel water as a natural element.
It's as if the little Ictyanders were testifying that life on the land emanated from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is about 9 months in the belly of the mother in the fruit water, and that it can then more easily get used to water.
In principle, it makes sense, since from birth to first swimming only lasts 2 weeks.
"It's too little time to forget something," says baby swim teacher Marina Aksenowa.
While for a newborn child the weightlessness is a much more natural condition, the woman does not come out without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles are rapidly reduced and the ability to squeeze out the child also decreases.
All right, let's deal with birth control.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special room to squeeze the child out.
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant question of Waleri Poljakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the education, the organism cannot train the skeleton and the muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put into a load suit in the orbit like an adult.
He will simply lack what is of elementary importance to his life.
"This experiment, which we undertake jointly, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the introduction of a disabled person, a completely inappropriate human being," says Igor Pestow, director of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems.
So far, the birth of children in the universe is mere theory.
At some point, however, it becomes reality when the Earth’s inhabitants break up in their spaceships into a distant planet that becomes the home for their all-born offspring.
NKÚ Chief: Control of the Black System Failed by Indebtedness of Politics
The Czech Republic has good control bodies and adequate laws in the context of public contracts, but falls within its scope.
In conversation for Aktuálně.cz, this is said by the Vice President of the Supreme Control Office (Novyšší kaullní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it has to be applied properly - and this is not the case with us in my opinion," Kala comments on the current situation.
A similar result appears to be a joint control by Czech and German examiners.
As a negative example of practice, he led Prime Minister Petr Nečas' appointment to the so-called "Black System".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not harass the entrepreneurs with controls - is the system now prohibited or allowed?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then the chairman of the government cannot simply come, and the Supervisory Authority, whose duty is now to control compliance with the law, can interfere with his activity," Kala states.
At the meeting of the Supervisory Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a common Czech-German project, in which the laws of both countries on public contracts were compared.
What was the point?
This is a parallel examination, which we started about two years ago.
To put it simply, it is a question of the European legislative framework defining how public procurement is to be carried out, building up national legislation, and finally there is the actual practical application.
All of this we have compared with each other, and although the examination has not yet been completed, we have been able to find extremely interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws are perhaps even a little "higher and more perfect", the actual application is better in Germany in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to set up new and more precise rules over and over again. It is also necessary to look at the actual application of the law.
How can the project help you? What results from this project?
Such joint control could help us to stop constantly trying to perfect the laws and reduce and eradicate thresholds, if this does not seem to be particularly positive.
Economics means buying one thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts.
However, the reduction of thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we also achieve this objective.
Perhaps it is even the case that we are only burdening the system with excessive "paperwork", and those who are looking for gaps in the system have it much easier to exploit the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Procurement Act.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority here as our NKÚ, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart to the NKÚ of the Bundesbrachungshof, which is similar to ours and also has a college, which is formed only slightly different. Basically, however, both authorities work similarly.
The competences are also comparable to a certain extent, but Germany is a state, i.e. there are also these accounting offices in the individual Länder - in which the German system differs from ours.
The BRD can only control federal funds, which corresponds to our state resources.
Public funds, administered by the districts and municipalities, are under the control of the state accounting offices.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare this with any specific information. Nevertheless, Germany is often referred to as an example in some respects, but it is certainly not possible to say that Germany is in all things better.
Is that because the examiners are better there?
This is certainly not the case, but as I said, I do not like such comparisons.
It should also be noted that those countries that are exemplary to us also face problems.
Otherwise they wouldn't have anything of a cooperation with our authority, would they?
As far as Czech legislation is concerned, what was the meaning for your authority of the amendment of the law on awarding the contract, do you already feel any effects?
In view of the fact that this amendment is only in force for a short time, it has not yet been effective in our tests.
As our checks are carried out afterwards, we have to expect a certain delay here.
So far, we have felt the impact of the new control instrument "Detection of risks of economic impeccability" in the preparatory phase of future controls, and are examining and analysing these almost 14,000 public contracts - here, of course, the changes will have an effect as the thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, among other things.
Do you see the adoption of this law rather positive, or is the system burdened with further bureaucracy?
I believe that this law is definitely a step in the right direction and hope that this assumption is confirmed.
However, there may be a problem that the rules become more stringent and cannot be complied with anymore.
Under the previous rules, the persons subject to an examination are already accountable to the institution (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) that any non-compliance with the law on the award of the contract is equivalent to an infringement of budgetary discipline.
But does it make sense to make the law even stricter?
I do not think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system and not punish those who have committed a form error that does not affect the actual decision-making.
Such a system simply puts bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out here?
First of all, let us say what is not the direction.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not enlighten the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black system" - what exactly does that mean?
Is the black system prohibited or allowed?
A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, the chairman of the government cannot simply come, and the supervisory office, whose duty is now to control compliance with the law, can interfere with its activities.
He can say, "We change the law and allow things to happen", but he can't say that we're doing this as if nothing were.
The Procurement Act contains relatively strict rules on the formal conduct of certain transactions - and that is also right for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the tenderer is excluded with the best offer only due to form errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied properly - and that is what I believe is missing.
On the streets there is isolated ice smooth, but mostly dry.
On the streets of the Czech Republic there are some snow and ice smooth.
Most of the roads, however, are well walkable, sometimes there is increased caution.
KaribaKarlsbad
In the district of Karlsbad the streets were well-walking this morning, isolated snow and ice smooth.
The temperatures fall to -5 to -10 °C, during the day it should be a little warmer.
In the region it is no longer snowing, and in the lower altitudes it remains only a thin snow cover.
On the ridges of the Erzgebirge, however, there are about 30 cm of snow.
According to the District Street Guard, there was limited visibility due to fogles.
The highway R6 and the first road class routes in the region are currently fully traversable.
However, attention is needed, for example, on bridges on which the railways are sometimes required and smooth.
All transport routes of the second and third categories of road, including the mountain roads, are also traversable.
On these roads, however, there remain partly required or exhausted snow residues.
Increased attention is therefore needed, particularly in the higher levels.
Districts Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some roads East Bohemia there is danger due to ice smoothness, in higher locations and in the mountains there is sometimes an exhausted snow layer on the streets, the street and motorway management on their Internet pages.
The road championships warn riders against ice slides, which can occur especially in higher locations in the Pardubice district.
Ice smoothing can be achieved in the districts of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto, in particular on transport routes of the second and third road classes.
Roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow is located especially on the streets in the Giant Mountains and in the mountain Orlické hory.
An extinct snow layer is situated on the streets of the Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In Eastern Bohemia today it is mostly sunny or cheerful, and it remains largely unbeatable.
The temperatures range between -3 and +1 °C, and a weak wind blows.
District of Pilsen
The streets in the Pilsen district are today well accessible, but local attention is needed, and the route should be adapted to the weather.
This is frosty in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing point.
Since it has previously snowed and the temperatures then fell, it can come to ice smooth on the streets.
Local fog is also to be expected, but the vision will improve in the course of the day.
This information is from the district street championships.
The D5 motorway is practically fully traversable, but increased attention is recommended by road masters between 80th and 131th km.
The roads of the first road class are mainly dry, but frozen.
However, in the south of the Pilsen and Tachov Circles, ice smoothing can be achieved.
The roads of the second and third road classes are damp, and therefore the reference to possible required sections is also valid here.
Drivers should be particularly careful on less frequent roads in the area of Bohemian Forest.
Olomouc District
With snowmatsch today, drivers must expect to be on their way towards altitudes in the Olomouc district.
After the use of scattering vehicles, the pass Červenohorské sedlo and the road to Videlský kříž remain snow patch.
Night snow drifts forced the road champions to use, Šumperk in the circle, according to road management data, fell about 3 cm of fresh snow.
In the other areas of the district, the roads are usually fully traversable.
"In Šumperk, snow remains in the highlands.
On the pass Červenohorské sedlo, the drivers have to expect snow with the direction of Jeseník," said one of Šumperk's employees today to the agency ČTK.
Her colleagues in the Jeseník district had to go out at night too, according to their data, the roads are free and wet to the heights after chemical treatment.
In Olomouc County, the streets are fully walkable, but in Šternberk County, the drivers have to drive carefully in forest sections, as the roads are still wet here.
Ústí nad Labem District, Liberec District
In northern Bohemia, the road champions report several road sections that are poorly walkable.
In addition to several places with snow or ice smoothing, the mountain road is blocked from Telnice to Knínice in the district of Ústí n.K. according to the traffic police.
The temperatures are also lower than zero in lower positions, so that snow and ice are kept on the streets. However, no problems are reported from the low plains, especially south-east of the Bohemian Middle Mountains, and the roads are usually dry there.
No traffic disruptions have been reported so far.
Ice cream is reported in particular from the Štětí perimeter.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this at night - rain and melting snow, cloudless sky and frost.
Bad transport conditions are reported from the main routes and from I/13 at the border of Ústí n.L. and Liberec districts.
The blockage of the road between Telnice and Kninice was required due to branches that were pushed from the snow load to the roadway.
Šimon Ornest: At our concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think is going to happen in less than a month of the world's downfall?
This is one of those disaster reports that we so much like to approach people.
With our band The Tap Tap we're rather funny about it and say that we're the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the world's downfall.
In December you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the world's downfall.
Can you present the project to our readers?
This is a nationwide benefit event that we have been planning for two years.
For this we want to use the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, whose end is predicted for December 21 at 11:10 in the morning.
On the day before that, i.e. on December 20, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava will take place at the same time.
The end of the concerts is supposed to be about the time on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is located in a time zone about 12 hours in front of us, ending Maya calendar.
Who did this idea come from?
Originally probably from me, then we designed the idea together with our graphic artist Honza Augusta.
Not only do we want to gather enough positive energy to prevent the world's downfall, but we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we once hand over this world to our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and keychains against the world downfall, with which people can also support us via www.e-tap.cz.
Together with other performers, the band The Tap Tap has also recorded the so-called hymn against the world downfall with the title "World Downfall Falls Out".
Already today, the hymn on YouTube is very popular. Will it also sound at the benefit concerts?
Of course, at the very end, provided that everything works and the end of the world does not take place...
The hymn is to be sung at the same time by all performers at all three concerts.
In addition, the hymns are transmitted live in a direct circuit by the Czech television.
The text of the hymn comes from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, and Xindl X sings with...
How did you come to cooperation with both?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is linked to the realization of many benefit events and concerts...
We're trying to get these people involved in our projects.
It has been shown that most people are interested in working with us, and have fun doing so.
What is the purpose of the proceeds of the concerts against the world's downfall?
For the establishment of the barrier-free educational centre Studeo, at which we have been working together for six years with the association Tap at the Jedlička Institute.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly cared for by teachers who help them with different leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the resources to visit the lecturers, we would like to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, we will build a separate building into which we will then move in with this project.
There are several groups and performers at each concert.
According to what criteria did you choose these?
We wanted to put together a program that appeals to all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý occur.
You can find out more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "large events" also planned for the future?
In May we perform at the Prague Spring for the first time, and also for this concert we prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to be present at the Czech House in New York, and I would like to associate this with appearances in Washington and Chicago, personally - if we are already in the United States.
Your foreign plans are not very small, so far you have appeared in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these trips logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it seems at first sight.
Five of our members are wheelchairs, i.e. the wheelchairs must be transported in the luggage compartment. We also of course need to carry many instrument suitcases and other luggage with us...
Nevertheless, it has always been possible without problems so far, ČSA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us, that I have sometimes already wondered myself in part.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your travel abroad you have a comparison of how accessibility in the individual countries looks like how to deal with disabled people there, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than with us, we were just witnessing in Russia that in the East everything is still in its beginnings.
In contrast to Prague, Moscow is absolutely not accessible for disabled people. It is still unusual when someone is travelling in the wheelchair alone in the city centre.
It is not even natural to leave a wheelchair driver in the elevator, for example.
Fortunately, there are also associations that try to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way do we have to catch up with the developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're hanging out with...
It should be noted, however, that improving the situation always depends on the efforts of the affected parties.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with severe disabilities to move independently in the public area, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
But it is not exactly common for a larger group of disabled people to participate actively in social events, in which we are a little ahead of the West with the band The Tap!
Respect in public and accessibility is one thing, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks will things really start to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly willful personalities.
The Tap is currently very popular. But if we go back a few years: What motivated you to create a band in 1998?
At that time, I started working as a supervisor at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in dealing with something intense.
And since I am a musician myself and I am playing saxophone among others, I have founded a music AG together with a colleague.
Well, in time, as our moderator, Lá.a. Angelovič, says, this is something out of control (laughs).
But it's only been known in recent years, or am I mistaken?
It is true that cooperation with well-known singers has helped us, and we have also started to actively advertise for us.
We have become aware that if you do something and this cannot be seen externally, your own performance does not exist in a certain sense.
Thanks to the EU funding, we can also provide good lecturers, high-quality equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to get it that far with The Tap?
From the beginning, I have felt the potential that you can do things differently.
In the show business, one often copies the other.
This is logical in his own way, since everything is considered new with caution and accepted only after a longer period of time.
There are only a few really unique things, and I dare to claim that Tap belongs to them.
The first impression that the viewer has most of the time is, of course, pity; that's only natural...
But this pity is absolutely superfluous because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we should regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop if they have the means to do so.
I always say that when people with disabilities succeed, this is not only a progress for themselves, but for the whole of society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you can't compromise in many things and you have to call for a certain discipline.
But this is quite normal in my opinion.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and then when they find that they have a test twice a week, have to complete preparatory phases and spend a lot of time on concert trips, then the enthusiasm disappears at many quickly.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
Currently, The Tap has twenty members.
How many of these were there from the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Lá.A. Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come and go, you can't stop it.
Whoever has the will and wants to join in is always welcome with us.
Takes place on the day before the forecasted world downfall, Thursday, December 20, 2012 at 9 p.m.
The venues are: Incheba-Arena/Prag, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues are finally connected by live recording and a common interpretation of the hymn "Worlddownfall fallout" of the band The Tap sounds.
The aim of the concert is to allocate funds for the provision of a multi-functionally disabled education centre to be created under the name STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague. Cost: CZK 25 million
The admission costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free of charge, tickets are available on sale at Bohemia ticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the Member States of the European Space Agency, Poland was taken up as the 20th member of this Space Agency. Poland is thus the second member country from the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a member of ESA on 12 November 2008.
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
The road of Poland to space began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish Cosmos enthusiasts were engaged in space travel, but they did not always come up with understanding.
I recall here, for example, the lecture by A. Šternfeld on 6 December 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, where the author presented thoughts from his pioneering work on "the entrance to the cosmonautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (b. 1905) left the listeners cold, and after years Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won the Prix Rep-Hirsch, founded by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch in 1934 for "entry to the cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important defender of astronomy and space.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's worldwide recognized contribution to space development was appreciated, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the face of the moon was named after him.
Already in 1925, a railway draisine was built in Poland, for which a rocket drive was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the design and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to start or brake the draisine.
The information for this purpose comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933 the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-powered shots.
The research carried out by the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrychiegi.
It is clear from the documents submitted that research has been carried out up to the stage of practical testing.
The research was then interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937 the technical press of the design by Ing. Rohoziński showed a photoelectric hunting dragon, and in the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda povietzrzna i rakitobomba lotnicza" by author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects dealt with the military use of rocket propulsion.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of rocket technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitte Doradczo-Naukowy).
The Committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of activity his work was completed from the beginning of the war.
Further articles on space travel were published in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first mention of this company is made in 1954 in the November issue of the magazine Problemy, in which four extensive articles of space travel are dedicated.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to set up a space company.
At the time, there were already the first projects on satellite technology, and it was clear that the exploration of space would have a future.
As early as 1956, the Polish space company PTA tried to join the International Space Federation, founded in 1951, and in fact the PTA became an ordinary member already in autumn 1956.
In the following year, the first PTA president, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became deputy chairman of the International Federation of Space Administration.
He was in office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been a major player in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first start took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and did not weigh quite 5 kg.
Later an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959, flight tests started in the Błędów desert with the two-stage rocket RM-2.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another level of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used for monitoring altitude winds.
However, further development was discontinued in 1962.
Following the first RM rockets, the Meteor-1 rocket was developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and its initial weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types of rocket were developed (meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket has a 0.4 liter capacity transport space, Meteor-1B more than 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C more than 0.62 litres.
The maximum flight altitude was 37 km at all three types.
In the years 1965 to 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed in the aviation institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a payload of 10 kg to a height of approximately 60 km.
After that, the versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland's accession to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, which followed the establishment of a national COSPAR Committee two years later.
Poland also participated in space research with Soviet satellites as part of the Interkosmos programme, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the Czech pilot Vladimir Remek second intercosmonaut.
The repeal of the law on non-profit activities is no solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court lifted the law on non-profit activities.
This decision gave rise to a lively public debate.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
Liberal economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the final effect, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with unbridled financial speculation.
Due to the great differences in the value of work (wages) there are price tensions.
This is a condition in which the manufacturer tries to survive in economic competition by importing cheap goods, by "substituting" competition, thereby tearing down a greater market share and increasing its profits.
To a large extent, this means for most companies to move or buy their production abroad cheaply, or to give up their business. The result is high unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Since private capital does not bear social responsibility and therefore does not bear any responsibility for the unemployment caused by it, it is necessary to increase public expenditure.
This situation is reinforced by the fact that the entrepreneurs are totally unwilling to pay their taxes and thereby replace the overall social and social damage caused by them.
This situation is generally known, so that specific statistics are superfluous at this point.
The reckless practice of private capital creates a situation in individual economies in which governments are forced to compete in order to artificially lower the social level of their own people and thereby attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments deliver private capital to their own people without regard for the social consequences.
This is particularly true in the case of amendments to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to force their own people to accept the dictates of private capital, particularly in the pay-as-you-go sector.
On the one hand, economic compulsion in the event of long-term unemployment, and on the other hand, the curtailment of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between poor and rich.
In Germany there have been public food tax offices for several years for poor people who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
In the course of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases in which workers receive such a low wage that the state has to raise their income to a minimum of existence.
Such a scandal was also revealed in the case of auxiliary workers employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all EU countries will undoubtedly run out to the same state where people are forced to emigrate under the pressure of a disastrous fall in their social level (as it was in the 19th century), or for hunger pay at the edge of society, hoping that someday private investment capital will flow to the country.
This naturally raises the question of where this capital comes from?
When it comes from another EU country, poverty only moves from one country to another; or capital stays out of the way, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or Africa, employees work for a fraction of European wages at all.
This concerns the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim that the state must not participate with capital in its own economy, and that the planned economy leads to an economic disaster.
Private capital insists on its view that the State should not intervene in the economy.
But then one has to wonder whether private capital does not influence or even direct politics and therefore the whole state in its own selfish sense.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The evidence of this is the existence of a practically almighty and omnipresent lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual advantage, legislation in which practically everything is gross, but nothing punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that a government ministry is responsible for the lack of finance for private legal companies closely linked to the industry with the preparation of draft laws.
These draft laws are subsequently passed in the Bundestag.
All violence is no longer based on the people, as the Western constitutions proclaim, but on strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Evidently, the liberal democracies are rapidly entering a situation as they describe Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesars and Pompeii': "The state has been in decay for a long time, and the offices have been occupied with violence.
Against lubricating money, by unlawful intrusion of advantages or with stone and sword.
Corruption grew unrelentingly, and the people went to the elections with already purchased voices" ... "People with character did not need for offices, so that the state had no consular for eight months as a result of this decline" ... "You really began to talk about the fact that the only medicine in this difficult situation was a sole rule, and that a strong man had to be elected"... Appian thought of Pompeius, but the strong man was then Caesar, who permanently replaced democracy by the sole rule.
As it turns out, today's society, as well as antiquity, is founded on the reckless preference of its own advantage, without paying attention to the interests of society as a whole.
The private capital is by its very nature not able to recognise and enforce the advantage for the entire society.
The result, today as at the time, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites who are not trying to make deeper reforms in the least.
The cause of fascism and communism must therefore be sought in the ruthless liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From today's state, the downfall of these regimes in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain break in which the next round is already taking place.
Especially catastrophic is the fact that today's elites face the potential loss of hundreds of thousands of lives in the future, the humanitarian and social catastrophes of which we are witnesses today, and the crimes against humanity, as we know them from the older and newer history, in complete ignorance.
The repeal of the law on non-profit activities is not a solution here, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to push down the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The only solution is targeted political-social reforms which increase the participation of the state in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favour of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
"...that nothing arises from violence or could ever arise" Sting sings in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the chorus is: "...that we may not forget how fragile we are" .
"If my sons didn't want war, there would be none," says the dying Gutele Schnapper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there was, as always, an innumerable number of reactions.
The one stand behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defense, while calling the Palestinians terrorists; the other, in turn, support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed on the Palestinian Arabs, and call the State Israel terrorist.
At this point I do not want to write about who is responsible and who is the victim in this ever-returning wave of killing; ultimately, today's inhabitants of Israel, including the self-government areas, have been introduced into the current political situation and have not experienced the start of violence itself.
It is my concern to open to readers the view behind the scenes, the view of whom the 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) are mainly useful in the small spots of the Middle East country.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from them and are derived from my own understanding of who or what group of people significantly influences the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily a story of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can make an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less apparent is the question of whether it was really always these personalities themselves who autonomously determined their steps, or whether behind their throne was someone who directed their actions to a pre-determined goal.
We must admit that we are living in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power did not arise within the life span of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families there is a particular one that could be described as the head of the Kraken (I don't know if anyone is standing above them, but I don't shut this down) - the Rothschilds.
A lot isn't written about her.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was purchased by the Rothschilds in the 90s of the 19th century to suppress the link between their name and high-criminal acts, in the background of which was always the strengthening of their power, the proliferation of their assets or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they wage wars or fight against them (before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5 countries, after which Ghaddafis fell only four more, while Russia has in the meantime placed its central bank under the Russian government).
Whoever tried to oppose this family had to pay with life for it.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew Rothschild's Bank of America's status as central bank, began to issue his own bank notes during the civil war and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the FED - he was murdered in 1963; member Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he tried to sue the FED for triggering the world economic crisis in 1929.
The global gulf of power of the Rothschilds led in the years 1859 - 1871 to the formulation of a plan to unleash three world wars by Albert Pik, a Freemason of the 33rd and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchic states of Europe, the second war was to break Britain's colonial rule in particular, and the third war was to reduce the world population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (a number of these would provide their conveniences and their luxury and would not consume so many resources), create a universal religion (Ecumenism is nothing more than the premise) and eventually lead to the takeover of absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families work with the Rothschilds is the trigger of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order from chao - order from chaos).
These solutions, however, are wrong and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the establishment of the FED, so that crises such as those triggered by them do not recur in 1907).
After the murder of Ferdinand the Habsburg Successor of the Throne in Sarajevo, they succeeded in triggering the First World War, they destroyed the Russian Tsar Empire by the revolution of the Bolsheviks.
The First World War ended with the sudden, military and economically unfounded capitulation of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian Tsar Empire, the war was no longer necessary), and then the dissolution of the Austrian Grand Power was followed.
In order to make the Second World War easier, the banks created a latent conflict situation through politics, occupying Germany with gigantic war repairs, creating poorer masses, so that they only had to subjugate a sufficiently strong leader to the Germans, who offered the guilty and simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multi-ethnic state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which would take on the function of a fifth column and also occupied it in order to unleash the fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschild initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought the establishment of a Jewish state, as far as possible in the historical territory of Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration already mentioned created the prerequisite for mass immigration from Jews to Palestine; there were first clashes with the native Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler broke free from the chain where the international bankers had initially held him, or whether everything was going according to plan, is only difficult to estimate, in any case the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the international community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as the war repairs against Germany were prepared for the ground for the Second World War, the proclamation of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for the Third World War.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish people will become the victim of the war in the front line of the Second World War, this time together with the Arab and Muslim populations of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (you can only think of how sharply the people of Israel are divided into followers and opponents).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, where injustice only causes injustice in an endless spiral of violence, with the greed of individuals and their pursuit of global power at the beginning?
One must distinguish here between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, but the international bankers in Israel as well as with us, the people, only make their own candidates their choice.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the Falcone Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascism-attacking politicians loyal to international banks, who do everything in their power to unleash a war with Iran which, in view of Iran's membership in the Shanghai Organisation for Cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could quickly extend to a global conflict, and which could lead to destruction of the world economy due to Iran's control of the only 2 miles wide street of Hormus, which runs over 20% of world oil supplies.
In what light are the words of David Rockefeller from 1994: "The only thing we need is an all-encompassing crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
In its vision, the new world order is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which a chip is implanted at birth for each newborn to subject this being to total control.
"And it turns out that the little ones and the great ones, the rich and the poor, the free and the servants all give themselves a sign to their right hand or to their foreheads that no one can buy or sell, because he has the sign of painting, namely the name of the animal or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom! He who has understanding, he who is contemplating the number of the beast.
For there is a number of men, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six."
The movie Argo: If it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of demonstrative Islamist students occupied the US Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
For their release, they demanded the delivery of the overthrown Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, who had preserved the patronage over his regime for decades.
For the American government there was no positive way out of this situation - she could not afford to throw the shawl overboard, as this would have greatly damaged the trust of her allies in other countries.
At the same time, she was unable to enforce the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a serious blow to the reputation of the united states, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt of the liberation of the hostages made everything worse.
The diplomats who were captured were finally released after 444 days after negotiations had been arranged by the Algerian Government.
The fate of the hostages evoked at home a wave of solidarity as well as anti-Iranian sentiments.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo by director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the United States a small victory.
Immediately before the arrival of the message, six ambassadors managed to flee.
This ended after many complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to bring the refugees from Iran, helping them with an extravagant story of their true identity - they traveled with Canadian passports bound as members of a film staff who allegedly visited film locations in the country for a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan developed by the expert for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, also required Hollywood collaboration.
To make the tarnation credible, the article on this film project appeared in specialist journals, there were press conferences held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have been kept secret for a long time, based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic political thriller, but also a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful housekeeper's play, such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
This changes the mood levels in the film - on one side the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and also in the film version of the same situations there are no major differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which are ironic and slightly over-peeled, are coming.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, on the halls, on the telephone...
Ben Affleck has achieved a remarkable restart in his career with this film.
From a smiled actor has become a respectable director, and also as an actor he is no longer the goal of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the Crimea No Children's Game (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the Thriller City Without Grace (2010).
At the same time it is Affleck's first film that does not play in the home Boston director's Boston film.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was one of the features that removed the previous films of this director from the standard Hollywood.
But Affleck also proves this feeling in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have really taken place - the entrance sequence of the indignation of the message is very impressive in its clarity, and nevertheless conveys the feeling of confusion and unforeseeableness that occurs when history moves somewhere.
Affleck also performs a similar effect with his team on fictional scenes (the false film staff on a bassoon in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story actually does not offer many exciting scenes in the cinematic sense.
With the few, however, he works quite successfully, sometimes helping the reality a little - which then doesn't always seem so elegant (the scenes in which the threatening crisis at the airport in Tehran is turned away from a telephone call in America, or also the persecution hunt on the runway, seem somewhat artificial).
The weakness of Argo is its all too wide spread, which is required by the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their characters would have earned more space, and they are far from alone in the film.
Affleck’s film thereby loses a bit of traction. It’s a film that you can track with a certain interest and goldize the design and the retro style reminiscent of a 70th-year-old thriller.
However, it is difficult to arouse enthusiasm.
However, as a reminder of a piece of history living to this day in a certain way and as a proof of how the notions of the almighty and all-knowing secret services are superior, it is sufficient.
Guidelines for blowing up air, for bananas and for circuses
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, who calls every year for a survey on the most absurd bank charges, has decided this year to organise the competition "Unsurveyable Regulation or Idea from the EU Workshop".
"This idea brought us the recent plan presented by the EU to introduce a 40% women's ratio in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, who is looking after the organisation of this survey, to the Právo newspaper.
Among the listed absurdities are, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the uniformisation of insurance rates for men and women.
Until then, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance because they are objectively less at risk for insurance companies.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will take place by the end of February 2013", Nacher announced.
Among the controversial EU regulations are the mandatory addition of bioethanol to fuels which, as a result, are damaging to nature, the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain a relatively small amount of this hazard substance, or also the directive on the size of chicken cages, because eggs became considerably more expensive this year.
Criticism in the past also caught the actual ban on the use of the term "butter spread" or also the sale ban for conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparat often decides under the pressure of this or that commercial and industrial lobby, whose demands are usually represented in Brussels by one or more Member States (for example, the Czech Republic is currently trying to enforce the claims of Czech banks with Veto threat too).
Lobby interests also argued that bananas of the highest class of trade in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and should not have "crumb anomaly".
The European Commission defended the argument that it only harmonises the uneven national standards that would hinder trade.
The EU's standards on fruit and vegetables have already been raised against the resistance of some countries, pointing out that the existing directives would lead to food waste.
A candidate for victory in this survey may be the EU regulation of last year, which according to balloons must be supplied with the indication that children under eight years of age should not blow up the balloon without adult supervision.
The EU called for an American study, which according to balloons is the leading cause of child suffocation.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age in the use of annual market straws.
Curiosis Illnesses are also at home
Relatively absurd is also a directive which affects European officials themselves - anyone who has an official function in the EU must not use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the theme for Greece and must instead say FYROM (Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovípoplatky.com server, in cooperation with the Liberal Economist Laissez Faire, also nominated the EU regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a Member State in addition to the above-mentioned absurdities.
The EU thus set the maximum volume of food stocks that could be found on the day of our accession to the EU in the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic then, for example, exceeded the set volume of mushrooms canned, for which we were threatened with a high fine.
The survey organisers were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or for the idea of giving grants for applications for grants.
These ideas, of course, were not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by the fact that we have no sea.
We will apply for reimbursement from the EU," said Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) Minister of Agriculture in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he argued that the grain harvest was very high and that the state stocks were overcrowded as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
Since the Czech Republic has another way to seaports, according to Palas, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
Finally, the European Commission met the Czech Republic so far that it organised an invitation to tender for the purchase of cereals from countries which do not have access to the sea.
Funding for applications for grants offered to the municipalities the Ministry of Regional Development under the direction of Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), in particular, should be a means of setting up aid applications in Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
While regulations are easily targeted at criticism in the Member States, the EU's efforts to regulate and thus also to ensure the effectiveness and development of the European Union as a whole do deserve recognition in the opinion of some experts.
According to these experts, a more serious problem is the EU funding for projects which have nothing at all to do with deepening European integration, but which have been forced into the budget negotiations of individual Member States.
Emotions in this area also highlight the fact that Czech Republic, like other Member States in Brussels, must fight for the right to use specific terms of traditional products and not always win this fight.
Although the Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké tvarůžky" after a six-year struggle with Germany and Austria, the Inländerrum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, our manufacturers had to rename them to "Tuzemák".
The designation rum may only be used for sugar cane distillate products, not for sugar beet products.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the world-famous cheeses of Feta and Gorgonzola, Lübecker Marzipans or Parmaschinken now also appear in the company of Karlsbader Zwieback, carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or also the Saazer Hopfen.
With an EU mark, the Pardubicer can brittle up some of the cakes or the Hořicer rolls.
"People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," Okamura claims.
Mr Senator, how do you come up with the idea of running the President's office?
It's not about me being Senator or President.
If everything were to work in our country without problems, I would not run anywhere.
But I can no longer look at how the Republic has been looted for 20 years, as thieves walk freely while people are being increased the taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambitions to become a politician.
But if I see something I don't like, then I'm trying to suggest a solution to change this.
And since I am already over 40, and for that I have no alternative but to influence things, but to run for the office of Senator or President.
In the Senate you did it and then made your way to the castle.
Does that mean you don't turn your constituents back?
I've been telling myself all along that I'm going to take up the fight for the castle after the Senate elections.
Later on, I made this clear and said that I would be running for the office of President if I were to be elected Senator.
But my goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
For this, I need as much influence as possible and a mandate as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not only that we, as a people, mock in the pub and in front of the TV, but that we lower everyone who wants to change something.
In addition, the media that want to rob you of the honor and that confuse the freedom of the word with freedom.
For example, it was claimed that I would bribe journalists or that I was a consultant to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
You have taken up the struggle for the castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive asset declarations over 20 million crowns.
To do so, you need to change laws.
As President, you have no competence in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can make legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have committed myself to keeping the tour guide a free trade and this could be enforced.
The problem is small-minded politics - if someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, this is deliberately rejected, and the population only stops doing so.
As an independent partyless, I have a much greater potential to gain support from all the parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that without having to think of drawers and party doggs, I can take from any party what is best for our country.
Do you see yourself as a person in politics rather on the right or on the left?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that people see me on the left.
But for me, this right-left thinking is completely unimportant.
For me, it's important that we move on.
I don't care if someone belongs to the left or right camp; I want to connect the people.
I publicly support every good solution, even if it comes from the KSČM or from the ODS, and I will also turn against bad ideas.
You're wrong if someone calls you populists.
But don't you confirm that by what you just said?
If you set up a business plan in a company, then you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And you want to get closer to this.
I think this is a populism, but all the suggestions I have spoken about already work in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without Parliament's support, you're just left with keywords.
And that will not get you far in politics in the long term.
Or do you think that if you talk to people for long enough, you will succeed, for example, in enforcing material and criminal liability?
I have no other option.
Politicians, journalists and the public to convince and try to bring them to our side in order to achieve these goals.
As President, it would be no problem for me to call on the chairmen of the parliamentary parties live on television to anchor the material and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And the speakers would then have to say, if necessary, why they reject this.
A strong personality that points to maladministration can exert pressure on the political scene.
Just take the direct election of the President, who was worthy of public pressure.
I'm quite clear that I'm an amateur; I'm neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just started with politics and I am trying to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I'm always trying to judge things myself; and if it doesn't work, I'm going back to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a little like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I alone can't achieve anything; so I talked to several known personalities about whether they didn't want to run for the Senate either.
For example, I spoke to Radim Jančura, but he refused because of work overload.
I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who discovered the fraud in the trade in light heating oil.
My candidacy began with the condition that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I am not sure.
Sixty percent of voters have not gone to the elections at all, and those who have gone have most of the time elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we're only two independents.
People have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, for example for the direct election of mayors and district governors.
Do you think about setting up your own party?
I have not thought about this because I have no time to review the past of any potential party member, nor do I have the money for it.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign yet; in my transparent account there are only 20,000 CZK.
You don't have any money?
You speak of wealth declarations, what did yours look like?
I estimate my private assets at about CZK 60 million.
In Prague, I have a land worth 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb worth about one million. And then I have a few million left in the account.
By the way, Aston Martin was a child's dream - James Bond has always liked me, as he drove in the car, was gallant to women and at the same time fought evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, you have 60 million assets and you don't have any money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not exactly convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do you want me to make a debt?
I've already put 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors shows that my program probably doesn't arouse too much interest.
And I am not obliged to deny the campaign from my own means.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I could not live alone from the senator's salary; I could not, for example, finance my son the English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't stand for anything.
So do you continue to work as an entrepreneur to get your results?
Didn't you say you're going to take these activities back?
But this is not related to the level of the salary.
As promised, I had some of my activities gone back.
For example, my deputy in spring becomes managing director of the travel agency.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live on something.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that is still the case.
As President, however, I would like to take a full stand for my activities.
The full conversation can be found in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not just in the head - by example of Spiekenisse and the recently built Bücherberg - 2 photos
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there's something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, a passant on the roadside.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby big business, says, "But, it's okay, the house."
But I wonder what we need a library for today.
All have Internet, iPad and e-books.
No one goes to one of these old-style libraries voluntarily today, right?
Spijkenisse, a small town in Rotterdam, is a remarkable record keeper.
The 80,000-resident community has the lowest education rate in the whole of the Netherlands.
In order to counteract this stupid circumstance, it was decided a few years ago to contribute to general education and to rebuild the seven fictitious bridges shown on the euro notes as beautifully brushed concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to become the statistics master: a library had to be here!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam Architecture Bureau MVRDV, master of the bold bar diagrams and producer of funny, often cynical buildings, took the matter with usual serenity and appeared in the face of the competition hearing anno 2003 with five books under the arm and a grin.
And while the jury was still suspicious of itself and shrugged with the axles, the frightful Maas piled his exquisite delivery of the size to a pyramid and ended his activistically substantiated speech with the words: "Dear Township!"
So he is, my proposal for the Bookberg of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million Euro mountain has been disbursed.
It is part of a revitalisation project, including underground parking, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and row houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Bücherberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This makes the faceless small town resorts, which so far had no more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian zone and a stateless ugly town hall, behind whose white facades one would tend to suspect a dairy factory, in order to enrich a piece of contemporary architecture.
In particular, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The Long Way to the Book
The first impression: a bookshelf under cheese bell.
There is a lift that leads through the middle of the mountain massif, but the true space and reading delights can be found in the climbing of the topography.
The glazed interior is bright and clear, the burned clinker floor and the elegant street lights speak the language of a public city square.
The urban ambience is perfect.
You already look out for parkbank, dog and football playing boys and girls.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"Normally, the bookshelves stand along the façade, and in the middle is a large, dark space, which is usually tireless and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We put the classic room configuration on the head and stole the reading area from inside to outside.
The interior of the Bücherberg is used skillfully: in the middle are offices, internet library, chess club, environmental center and house technology center.
A special pleasure are the black bookshelves, which sometimes are wall paneling, sometimes brothing, sometimes ladder rails.
Optics, haptics and smells are foreign.
Even nested architects and construction engineers shake their heads whether the unknown building material is.
"We wanted to work with recycling materials here," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, on request of the standard.
And so one day, in a French farm, we found a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years in the Netherlands, a millimetre-thin plastic fleece has been used as a root material in greenhouses and in fields.
This is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile lasts one, two seasons, after which it is ripe for the sperm.
For the library, the nonwovens - for the first time in these quantities - were pressed to four centimeters thick plates.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) becomes a dark, homogeneous, loadable material that smells a little bit like new cars and a little bit like sports shoes.
After 105 steps you reach the summit.
At the end of the almost 500-metre-long hike you will not only be rewarded with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquets and cultivated ficus trees.
They provide atmosphere, but above all provide the right humidity in the literature mountains.
Donate for the New Soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but this house is a demonstration project in muncto ecology despite the many glass surfaces," says Trouborst.
It is heated and cooled with earth heat.
Although the Bücherberg is under a glass crash, the sun shines into the interior even on sunny days.
The wide wooden glue binders, which stand across the glass façade, serve as shading and capture a large part of the sunlight.
The room climate is very pleasant.
The rest are doing fully automatic rollos.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic from the IT industry, had already ventured to the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was there too.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even calls the Boekenberg the "longest overdue soul".
The reason: For the opening a few weeks ago, every resident was invited to donate a book from his personal inventory.
This is to fill the optical gaps in the library - currently 70,000 pieces - which have not yet been filled.
The concept has begun.
The shelves are filled up to the top.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's only for decoration.
This led MVRDV to succeed in that kingly discipline that is mentioned in the professional jargon identity foundation.
Spijkenisse wrote the history of literature.
So young and uneducated she may be.
This is at last a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a bigger role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the inclusion of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert on US-European relations, Berlin is balancing on a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had initially signaled that it would vote against the request for an observer status of the Palestinians with the United Nations.
But then Berlin contained itself.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, being too critical of Israel.
During the insurrection in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it was about setting up a flight ban zone.
It was finally enforced by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
That is because it is precisely transforming its foreign policy away from a policy that has been managed so to speak by the US towards a German foreign policy.
It is more difficult that Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
The Germans thus find themselves between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still working on their role, but they are on their way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy as they have France or Great Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness to take up positions independent of those of the US or European partners in national interests.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain degree different from those of the other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did these economic interests influence the attitude of the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
First, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
Therefore, it must be careful not to confront the public, but also the elite, in the Arab countries.
It certainly matters.
But I wouldn't want to assign too much weight to it either, that's not a completely one-sided relationship.
But it certainly plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by abstaining from important decisions, for example in voting on Palestine?
I believe that there is a great deal of understanding of the German position in Europe and even in the USA.
That is why I do not believe that this was such a dramatic break as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even show some respect.
It signals, however, that it will be taken seriously as an international player and its interests must be considered.
There are various opinions on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The United States, on the other hand, has clearly voted for a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
Because of American domestic policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that under Obama the government probably has quite a lot of understanding of the European position.
But due to the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, publicly represent this position.
I believe that the actual differences of opinion are not as big as they always appear.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so thrilled by Netanyahu's politics.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is not at present the case.
So they can't be part of a wider line and have to push things out of their own position instead.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will play a leading role in pushing Europe into a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, because of the relationship with Israel.
It's always been a sensitive topic.
But I believe that the Germans are aware that they need to play a more independent role.
Does Germany itself see itself in the role of an important international player - does Germany want to play a leading role at all?
Or does Germany still have a difficult leadership role?
Germany is not yet used to it, it is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a bigger role.
For example, if we look at the euro crisis, every time Germany assumes a greater role, different anti-German feelings become free.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
This is actually the old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
Germany is in a much more difficult position than the USA.
It must be receptive to various neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
Now the influence of the US in European policy is steadily decreasing, but the EU is not filling this vacuum at the moment, who else is there?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
Even if they do not like it, it is unpleasant to them and makes them much more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Markenschutz" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren too.
But what is Armani Polo?
There is an officially registered name in China that has nothing to do with the original companies.
Nevertheless, it enjoys protection for as long as the actual namemakers do not complain.
And even then, it's not clear if they're getting right.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer at Taylor Wessing law firm, who specializes in protective violations in Fernost.
Every week, a new case ends up on my desk.
A few additional letters are already sufficient to allow them to register their trademarks.
This is how Gucci will simply insert Lu-Gucci instead of Prada Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sports product manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with entries from the trademark office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company had the trademark Zegna DF Puma protected, an art name that was also used at the Ermenegilgo Zegna fashion house.
It is well known that the Chinese world champions are in copying and in injured intellectual property.
In the big cities there are multi-storey department stores that sell almost exclusively forgery.
But Pattloch's cases are different: On behalf of his clients, he argues that Chinese companies are officially given the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call the "Bang Mingpai", a passenger brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan".
This means women who fish for rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt
"This is business-damaging, you have to fight it," Pattloch asks.
"The brand is diluted, the sole setting disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial failures and process costs of the industries concerned go into the millions, especially in the case of expensive display products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third largest market for luxury products and the fastest growing volume of 15 billion euros per year.
However, deletions of duplicate entries in the trademark register are difficult to reach and go into money.
For up to nine years, the procedure can proceed with uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports of cases in which the court rejected actions because, after the long duration of the contested name, it had become a "market reality".
If the plaintiff has bad luck, he even has to pay the plagiarist because he violated his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump builder Putzmeister.
The Chinese are therefore allowed to use a logo similar to the Mercedes star until today.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-white logo that reminded BMW; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, who let the famous crocodile look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing admits that there had been bottlenecks in 2010 due to too little personnel and space equipment.
Last year, however, the "emergency situation in the course of work has returned to normality".
For example, the stock of unprocessed opposition proceedings had fallen by 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 such cases were completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 petitions are still waiting for completion in the Office.
Dealing With the Challenge
As so often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year the CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost one third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China will list the new applications worldwide for the tenth consecutive time, the Authority shall notify.
This also applies to the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan had been charged.
This means that each registration on average costs 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
On the other hand, it costs several times as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the Group has been fighting a Chinese plagiator.
Although the Germans were able to achieve that its illegal manufacture of imitated parts of motor vehicles has been eliminated.
However, the imitator continued to secure Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand.
It was not possible to protect family names in Germany themselves, says Hanno Wenzler, Chairman of the Management Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trademark office CTMO also rejected the opposition of the Municher.
In the next two instances Freudenberg got right, but the opponent of the trial continues to fight.
You've got to be careful.
Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wenzler is confident to conclude the matter well, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The process is extremely elaborate and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly be estimated, the company archive had to look through even a hundred-year-old files in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the opposite in vain a "high six-digit euro amount".
"You can see how much this is worth to us," says Wenzler.
The dangers in Fernost are even threatening to float back to Europe.
Well, that's when Imitators secure unprotected marks there.
A Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business area has long since been abandoned by the Group, but he was still able to cancel the registration.
"You have to watch out for hell," says Wenzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advised German companies to be very careful about business with China.
On the contrary, it is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, but the foreigners "should register in China everything that is somehow worth protecting," as Wenzler says.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg was subject to his brand drama in the last act, then one would probably have to pay the opposite license fees for one's own name, says Wenzler.
Or we will be forced out of the market in the segment in question.
World Aid Day: Stamping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi - and in Swaziland are looking forward to it.
The story of a connection that overcomes well over 8733 kilometers.
First there is the stamping: Cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's pumps and men's slipper are looking for the beat on the parquet floor, finding him quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Then the vocals of the singers slowly swell - old, bass, tenor and soprano - indignant, and persecute themselves.
And Fie Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, is about to take it out of his shoes when he brings it together with his smooth-willed gesture.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi tastes a new song.
Fifty singers have come from 23 to 69 years old, from the human geneticist to the houseman.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each choral voice has a different text and this also in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Aid to self-help
There are around 34 million HIV-infected people worldwide, the estimate of Unaids, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS.
23.5 million of them live in the South of Africa.
Twenty-four thousand AIDS pigs live in Swaziland.
More than 40% of the population are now HIV-positive.
For 180 Aidswaisen in the village of Esistcheni, the association Voices for Africa Paten has found in Germany.
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can take a sponsorship.
It guarantees the child school money, school uniform and a warm meal daily in the Gogo center.
On Zulu, Imbongi means storytellers or even praisers.
The Bantu language fluent can speak in this room no one, but sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language and occasionally brings them back to where they originally came: in the South of Africa.
For 8 733 kilometers of air line from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Eshituni, which depends on the voice power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
Some 2,000 people live there, some still living in simple clay and straw huts, most of which are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents anymore because they are responsible for the HI virus.
In Esicheni there is a small one where Swaziland suffers from disease: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to Unicef.
Cuts of male foreskin, which are shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, are hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the immune deficiency virus in themselves to die with mid-thirty is not rare.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, which not only lacked parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without graduation in a poor country, you don't really have a chance.
In the beginning, it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and make it possible for him to have a warm meal on the day.
A year later, however, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa", which has been working almost professionally on the Aids Waises in Esisteni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (gonorrhea).
Common viral STIs are HIV, Human Papillomavir, Herpes Genitalis or Hepatitis.
Felt lice and herbs are part of the parasite STI.
Who are the main stakeholders?
Syphilis and Tripper are particularly common in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five of all syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomonads, candidiasis (pills), trippers and human papillomaviruses are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country is comparatively low - nevertheless, around 20 percent of HIV new infections are present in this group.
Chlamydia infections are significantly more common in adolescents than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
In addition, human papylomaviruses are common in adolescents.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reported.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections from 1697 in 2001 has more than doubled to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of HIV infections has decreased since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This is about a tenth less than a year earlier.
What symptoms suggest a sexual disorder?
Infections can cause genital ulcers, urination disorders, discharge, abdominal pain, bladders or warts.
However, they often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore do not notice.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection but do not offer 100% protection.
In part, pathogens from sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through lubrication infections and close body contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular investigations, especially in frequently changing sex partners.
Early diagnosis of most STIs can be cured and later consequences can be avoided.
Through sponsorships, donations and, not least, the gifts that the choir envoys all over Germany, some come together.
"Overall, we have already sent around 200 000 euros to Esistcheni," says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-conscious and assertive woman, manages the funds from Germany.
She also takes care that the orphans are well accommodated, for example, with one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as they call the old women on Zulu, are the support of the village.
Some of them have taken up up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and make sure that the children in their uniforms appear on time every day for school lessons.
Anyone who doesn't have any more comes to the shelter to Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the club just as the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has created a sewing school, built two chicken houses and organized together with the US health organization PSI that many in the village have had an HIV test done.
This is not a matter of course, for as obviously the disease is throughout the country, it is said to be the most loved one dead.
A king with 14 wives
"Aids is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Oddly strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for its extreme lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state-sanctioned form of life that the HI virus has spread so rapidly over the past decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the land.
Free condoms could be found in every corner," says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
The culture is another - flesh to flesh."
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels through the South of Africa every two, three years together and sings songs full of pain, spirit of combat, confidence and black self-confidence, many of which still know on the southern tip of the black continent from times of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but also has some fierce border soldiers shed a few tears.
The journey always leads to Esicheni, where the singers visit their baby children.
Even if you can hardly find the small village on maps, it is more than known in the valley of the Ezulweni river.
"Going to Esicheni, there's the light" the people there say.
And if you return the 8733 kilometers air line to Heidelberg, to the stamping singers in the sample room on Bergheimer Straße, you can see it shining there too.
Messenger: NASA discovered ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover may have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The US Space Agency NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also frozen water, as three studies published on Thursday in the "Science" magazine show.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the region of the planet permanently in the shade.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly asteroids that are impacted on the Mercury.
But no one is related to the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger Son, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help to clarify how water and other building blocks of life have arrived in other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the citizens of the earth are probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix to explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send pictures to the earth: Small holes in infinite distances.
The picture comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, and the dwarf planet Ceres.
According to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006, Ceres is not a "planet" as Pluto, who craves the sun behind Neptune.
This picture section of an infrared recording of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of uncounted star generations: The oldest stars can be seen as blue points, more difficult to identify are the pink "newborns" in the star circle hall.
This star region - called unromantic W5 by scientists - has discovered the telescope Spitzer in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light years.
This dazzling glow of a dying star has captured the Nasa's Spitzer telescope.
The Donut-shaped ring consists of material that the star dragged out in the dying process.
In the huge trifide fog, 5400 light years away from Earth, new stars are created from gas and dust.
The Spitzer telescope of the Nasa shot this photo of the galactic birthplace.
The plejad cluster, also called "The Seven Sisters", can be seen with the naked eye at night.
With the telescopic, however, the colours come into use better.
Like a red Age, the Helix Nebula looks at this infrared photo in front of the viewer.
It is located 700 light years away in the Aquarius constellation.
His resemblance to an earthly continent brought this fog in the title North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo ensures spectacular coloring.
This baby star could only be recorded in its full beauty by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and his rings: How these were created is one of the great riddles of astronomy.
They may be the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared without trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and strongest recordings of the Hubble telescope: The Jacuzzi Glaxie
Depending on colouring, recordings of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows the trifid fog in the constellation Schütze, which is several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifid is derived from the Latin word trifidus (trifidus, tripled), because dark dust strips triple the glowing heart of the star birthplace.
In the constellation of snake carriers, astronomers have photographed the prostheses of a cosmic carambolage: 400 million light years away from the earth, the cores of two melting galaxies race to one another and will inevitably collide with one another.
This star birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
To whom technical abbreviations do not lie, she may call them Southern firewheels by her nickname.
The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows an excerpt from the Iris Nebula in the constellation Kepheus.
The nebula, which is 1400 light-years away, consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was assembled from optical and x-ray recordings of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, named Arp 273, recorded the space telescope Hubble for the Nasa.
The larger spiral galaxy call scientists UGC 1810.
The brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way is located in this star nebula.
The crib produces new youngsters.
Also, these star clouds, connected with the rosette fog, continuously produce new baby stars - 5,000 light years away from the earth.
In this brightly radiant galaxy with a small black hole there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Researchers suspect that he was born only shortly after the Big Bang, when he was found mainly hydrogen in the universe.
Our insights into all: The most important telescopes
The telescope is to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 - even before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have become ever bigger - and the insights they provide have become deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the world's largest telescope.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., there's the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows glances into the universe right over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inside of the Gran Telescopio Canaria on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone comes to 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
Disadvantaged construction: The telescope is fixed in its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The Hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at altitude.
Its special feature: the high light collector power.
In fact, despite relatively low mirror diameters, this is reaching the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radiotelescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers hear all of it after extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
With the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), every computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope - which honors his name.
With its four mirrors in total, the telescope can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror is to be set up with 42 meters and is composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, images can be expected at the earliest in 2018.
By 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors with an average of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna-Kea Observatory, which looks into the sky alongside them with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on the Mauna Kea a new, huge telescope is to be created - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is to be admired on an illustration.
However, the most important impressions from space are the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, there have been images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Space Telescope Kepler has been looking for extrasolar planets - mainly for those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, the Nasa announced that 1235 planet candidates have been identified since the beginning of the mission.
In the picture the last start preparations at the Kepler Space Telescope are documented.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is shot into space on board an Ariane5 rocket in 2018 at the earliest.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the tasks of the telescope: It should be looking for light from the first stars and galaxies for the Big Bang.
Scientists assume that the Merkur ice also exists at the southern pole.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as the Messengers are much closer to the North Pole around the planet.
Radar measurements have for decades indicated that there is ice on the Mercury ice.
Through the Messenger Sound, which was launched in 2004, the first to crave the Mercury, the scientists now have certainty.
Drink butter every day - and age 168
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a Biblically high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A trace search in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a Biblically high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A trace search in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
The ride through the Talysch Mountains is called wild-dromantically.
The small bus roams over the winding road, past densely wooded hills, raging rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you could think you were in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here the Caucasian population of the Talischen people lives, which is not known much, except that they speak Persian and Asherian perfectly and are very long-lived.
End station is Lerik.
The small town prots with too massive grated architecture from Soviet times, which does not want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, too difficult is the drive from Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometers you need eight hours, because the road is only intruded.
The legendary wealth the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the stuff for the tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May with the Eurovision song festival - and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here the Vita is documented by about eight dozen talyschen from the area, who are older than 100. Fatulayeva shows on a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, one child was born
But the controversial star of the museum is the shepherd Şirali Müslümov, who is supposed to have become 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And given the oldest documented man, who was 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born here in the region in 1805, and died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 he should have been a daughter.
So did Şirali Müslümov account for himself at his age for a few decades?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, a senior researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of the high-aged people in Central Asia.
"There are a lot of high-aged people in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are extremely many very old men."
However, due to the lack of evidence, there should be no scientific evidence of age, especially in the absence of a register of persons.
Every day slightly melted butter
However, the fact is that the people of the region around Lerik often reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years of age.
So why do so many high-aged people live here in the South?
The Asherian guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talischen.
Museum director Fatulayeva believes, on the other hand, that it is in the diet.
But that the high-calorie diet of the talys should be so healthy that the meat, bread and, above all, dairy products love and many of them drink a glass of melted butter daily, doesn't seem particularly plausible from the scientific point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzayeva lives in Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the city of Lerik.
With its 97 years of age, it is relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butter barrel, which she tirelessly rolls over and over.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and one daughter, both of whom are long-standing grandparents.
Two grandchildren also jump around.
In the kitchen you prepare the guests tea, which is served in the typical curved Armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth stand perfectly in a line and line, under her headcloth she hides long, dark-blonde pots that her son proudly reveals before us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out and kept their color.
"I've never used Shampoo," Mirzayeva says.
Monthly Pension Sustained
She always ate only what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life, I haven't bought food in the supermarket once.
Then she tells of her husband who was in the army.
It was the worst in the period after World War II.
But everything got better when the "loved father" Heydar Aliyew took over the row.
The propaganda sounds strangely out of the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult, which is driven around the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, hardly knows boundaries in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003 and later his son Ilham took over the rowing.
After all, there is no need under Azerbaijan's old people.
230 Manat (e.g. the same sum in euros), Mirzayeva receives monthly as a pension, for local circumstances an amount of which one can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayevas too is right for a long time: "The elderly enjoy high esteem in our culture."
They live in the midst of the large family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If that's no reason to stay alive for as long as possible
The word "human right" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rivalling rallyes in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country.
The future Constitution with Sharia as the basis is fiercely controversial.
The Egyptian president did not save with Pathos.
We must create the transition.
"And that he succeeds is in my responsibility, in front of the people and in front of God," he said on State television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but most certainly to the Christian heads, the liberals, enlightened Muslims and seculars.
Because all of them, so far hopelessly crumbling in a controversial opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a God-state at the Nile of graces of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He, said Mohammed Mursi, almost apologized for temporarily curtailing the competences of the Constitutional Court and broadening his competences to "save the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who has a doctorate title at the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, over which the Egyptians are themselves, the world is not quite clear.
Do you want the Judicial to be removed?
In fact, the 234 articles, which were fed through by the Islamist-dominated 100-member constitutional assembly, are partially disturbing in a nightly, 15-hour parforcerite.
As in previous constitutions, it is stated in the draft that case law is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
That was and is the point of interpretation, and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the floating formulation and the legal scope that goes with it for a more stringent interpretation of the Sharia.
This suggests at least a new article added: in all the matters relating to Sharia, Al-Ashar University had to be consulted, the country's most important Islamic institution with great radiation power throughout Sunni Islam.
This does not have to, but it may mean that the clergy oversee the legislation, which de facto would result in the proclamation of the Judicial.
Much in the draft version is an interpretation
Also problematic: Civil military justice should continue to be maintained.
These courts served during Mubarak's rule to suppress oppositionals.
After the dictator’s overthrow, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
The state should also, so it stands in the design, "the true being of the Egyptian family" protect "and promote their morals and values".
This is legally so disproved that with the help of this article, state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature.
In plain text, this means nothing but censorship.
By the way, no article expressly states equality between men and women.
For this, another man forbids insulting or slandering the prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is an insult, and how it is to be given, remains unclear.
Likewise, dubios encourages the wording that "injury of people" is forbidden.
Is there enough caricature of the President or a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
The point of interpretation, as so much in the draft, which Mursi signed and according to his words "very soon" is presented to the Egyptians for the referendum.
"The revolution has returned"
The opposition has been formed against Islamists for weeks.
Tens of thousands gathered on Friday evening at the Tarhir Square in Cairo, and praised to bring the Charter to its effect before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-placer of the presidential elections.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El-Baradei stated that the Constitutional Draft belongs to "the Mullberg of History".
Through short news service Twitter, he accused Mursis' followers of wanting to "putsch against democracy".
"When he calls out the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet wanted," the Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they would not want to monitor the referendum, which would invalidate it.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, blew to the local demonstration, but for the sake of caution, not on the Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other Niles in front of the Cairo University.
Many veiled women and followers of the Salafis participated and cried out, "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded of Mursi, "Clear the land!" and said, "The Qur'an is our constitution."
A struggle for the holiness over the symbolic Tahrir place on which everything began would have claimed civil war-like conditions.
Mursis' followers obviously didn't want to risk that.
The Muslim brothers declared that both the opponents of the draft constitution and the supporters had spoken out loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people decide on the ballot box in which direction the country should go.
A majority for the design of Islamists is considered safe.
"The Word of Human Rights doesn't even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this forced constitutional process, which should have gone by February and involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their view of the world, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
He was beaten, sentenced, imprisoned for that.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution," he laments in conversation with the "World on Sunday".
Mursi had the lawyer resigned on all three powers in the state.
These measures are gross violations of democratic rules and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President put her de facto out of power," laments Saeda.
But without civil society organisations a democracy could not work.
Saeda feels left alone, also by the international community, who looks at the ideological direction struggle at the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
It could be revenge.
A demonstrator on the Tahrir warns: "You are giving a monster that you can no longer control."
Rakfisk from Norway: Is that the worst fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards - not only in Europe but all over the world.
Could the country’s secret of success have something to do with the local appetite on quite foul fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheeses.
They are placed in the midst of a pile of dirty, damp sports clothing.
And check it out for a week.
So about that, you have to imagine the wet-breathing smell of Rakfis, one of Norway's great delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fenres, about three hours from Oslo.
There are snow, spectacular landscapes here - and this persistent smell in the air that just doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfisk is sprinkled with salt forelle, which - depending on how stinking one would like his fish - is fermented in water for up to a year.
If in Norway the darkness comes over the country and the weather gets colder, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fenres, which is, now, really very specialty.
"You eat it raw and then rinse it down with a glass of Aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire department, but also hosts the festival as a so-called "Rakfiss General".
Around us people eat small fish cubes and consume large amounts of alcohol.
"Many people like the Aquavit more than the Rakfisk," says Havard.
The spirit can dissipate the smell.
I'll cost you some ponies.
If you avoid getting the rocketfish close to your nose, it is not bad - for example, like Sushi, who has a quite long bus ride behind him.
Rakfisk is the product of a completely different, much poorer Norwegian era than there were no cooling possibilities and fish was drowned in airtight salt water barrels in the autumn.
In the deepest winter, he was then taken out after long fermentation and, no doubt with the help of alcohol, was consumed.
Even before a generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and mainly migrated to the United States.
Today the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health care system.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who was not too long ago more rich than Norway, streamed immigrants.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, though strictly smelly part of Norwegian history.
He's one of the more expensive dishes you can buy here.
But actually everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proudly 10 euros.
Norway doesn't often make it into the world press, and most people don't seem to bother.
Here they still hate to name Anders Breivik - those racist right-wing extremists who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, you only refer to the "Event of 22 July".
Nor do you find it difficult to accept that someone in her peaceful country is capable of such brutal murders.
The main responsibility for today's wealth in Norway has been the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries since the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason why we're doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, who distributes round tablets with mature shrimp fish and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blonde hair and the stinging blue eyes.
We are a people - as they say - prudent.
Your English is just like that of most people here.
We're not very glamorous, we don't like braiding.
Norway has handled its oil wealth very carefully - a large part of the industry's yields are invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When in the years leading up to the world economic crisis, all of them spent money that they did not have, Norway kept its wallet tightly closed.
"As long as we can go skiing in winter and go hiking in summer, we are happy," Anna says.
"Eating Rakfis of course," she adds with unhealed laughter.
I stand in the snow and stand for another dish - from Rakfisk I have enough.
Such an elk burger is definitely something else, the juicy meat reminds me.
But in the evening, the stink fish is back on the menu.
The hotel in which I live is one of several venues that organize a Rakfis dinner, where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the senses of smell the most challenging - fish.
There is a live TV recording for a showmaster dressed with fly, surrounded by plates with rakfisk.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What do you score up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Hadard."
You clapp and laugh.
A man falls off his chair, perhaps overwhelmed by the Aquavit.
But maybe it's the strict darkness of all the fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces a difficult start
While Mexico's future President Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing to take office, Will Grant from the BBC analyses the challenges ahead and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, the traffic in Mexico City is very bad.
Even on better days this is an ever-congested city, but on Monday a ring of steel was built that blocks several important traffic routes to the capital and provides chaos on the streets.
The aim, however, was not to disturb commuters on their way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new President Enrique Pena Nieto will be given the presidency and take the lead of the nation.
He is faced with a complex task.
Under the distinguishing government of Felipe Calderon, Mexico has been able to prove itself economically well, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has cost 60,000 lives over the last six years.
"My government is strongly committed to reducing violence," Pena Nieto said at the Oval Office at the beginning of this week, U.S. president Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this objective.
Before taking an eye on the U.S. president, Pena Nieto served as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, vast part of the country that surrounds the capital, opinions about the new head of state are shared.
A direct man
In the remote town of Valle del Bravo, for example, you would like to remember him.
Residents of the resort attribute to him the development of tourism and the construction of the infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on one of the highways that Pena Nieto had built and that represent a great improvement over the fragile, bumpy roads that once existed here.
Posters with their names also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect real and lasting changes from him," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a congressman for the Pena Nietos party, the PRI.
In particular, as regards safety and the economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country so urgently needs.
After 81 years of power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Olvera, a Congressman, admits that after 12 years, the party is facing great expectations beyond the presidential palace of Los Pinos of Enrique Pena Nieto.
The opposition's accusations, the new president's lack of substance, he rejects.
He is a very direct man, very committed and has great plans for the country.
He is an outstanding statesman, but above all he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other hand, not many people share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The town is hidden under highway transfers and in many ways is a suburb of Mexico-city itself.
And the problems in the community are of a decisive urban nature.
At the beginning of this year, the military was deployed to combat the drug gangs operating in the quarters, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
The bodies of dozens of murdered women were left on a spot near a large garbage dump in the last two years alone.
During the reign of Governor Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistics that even surpasses the city of Ciudad Juarez, who is notorious for their violence and murder of innocent women.
Critics Pena Nietos consider that he has at least not dealt properly with the problem of women's murders during his term of office.
But in the worst case, his government closed its eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the run-down district, Irinea Buendia fights with tears as she shows me photos of her dead daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed," recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body star had already been used.
As her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall. It is placed next to a cross that carries one word: justice.
But it is precisely this, says the family, that she has been refused so far.
The authorities have treated me as being a nurse, troublemaker, nörglerin.
You want your verdict to be accepted and your mouth shut.
"But that's not possible if there were so many form errors and failures," she says.
If President Pena Nieto receives the presidency on Saturday, he will also take on a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have suffered from violent crimes over the past six years, and the new president has promised to take special care of this problem during his term of office.
"I hope as President he is as governor," says Olvera, a member of the PRI Congress in Valle del Bravo.
But the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of that.
The prosecution claims: Bradley Manning has not complained about abuse
The prosecution contradicts Bradley Manning's allegations that he was being assaulted in prison.
The hearing deals with Manning's military prison time in Quantico, Virginia
The defense aims to reject the charge due to harsh terms and conditions of detention
The US Army's release is accused of having used thousands of confidential documents
The prosecutors on Friday tried to find out that the army-free Bradley Manning - accused of the largest disclosure of confidential information in American history - failed to complain about the abuse he allegedly suffered in military custody.
In a cross-examination of Mannings during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fine stated that documents on weekly visits by prison officials during Manning's nine-month term of detention in Quantico, Virginia had no complaints about his treatment.
One day before the cross-examination, which was held as a result of an application for the defense to dismiss the charge - Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the hard imprisonment - Manning had stated that he had considered the suicide in prison.
The U.S. Army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his term in Iraq.
The material was then published on the Internet by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as a source of information.
In the Friday hearing, Fein went through the forms with Manning, who had filled out officials after their meeting with Manning during his detention in the Quantico Military Prison, where he had been detained under increased detention conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
When Fein asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had assessed the treatment through his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by setting up overall as "very professional".
The forms, according to Fine, did not contain any complaints about abuse, although officials had asked Manning directly about his treatment.
Manning replied that he expressed his concerns orally and the officials had discussed them with him and indicated that they had not been recorded.
"They wrote up "no problems" (after discussing the concerns) and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't say anything at all," Manning said.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to examine the suicidal idea he had mentioned on a form a few months earlier.
Manning replied that during this meeting his intention was to have his observation status downgraded to "prevention of injuries".
The military said it had assigned him this restrictive status, one of which is under the threat of suicide, to him and to the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that I was doing well, and to get rid of the observation status for the prevention of injuries (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life from my point of view," said Manning.
Manning announced his arrest and relocation to Kuwait on Thursday, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the Quantico Marine Base Prison in Virginia in July 2010.
He said in Kuwait he considered suicide and had become unconscious once because of the heat.
Not to know what happened to him or to the outside world was burdensome.
"My world shrunk on Camp Arafjon, on this cage together," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
When he was moved to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
Only a mattress, a blanket, flip flops, clothes and glasses were allowed.
Manning said he was trying to stay in motion, for on the day it was forbidden to sleep or just lie down.
Instead, he had to sleep with light that penetrated from the outside into his cell.
If he turned around at night and could no longer watch his face, he was woken up to be turned back.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally filed an appeal against Manning's treatment.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas military prison.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked about an accusation he had made in his statement on Thursday - so he slept in his cell naked for one night in Quantico and had to stand naked before guards and other prisoners in a morning count.
Manning had said he had never had the opportunity to cover himself with his blanket during this count.
On the Friday survey, Manning said that he had closed out of an order of his guard that he should have dropped the ceiling with which he could have covered himself. However, he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning had said that he had been forced to sleep naked on the previous night. He had previously tried to show an official that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning told the official that he could have used the alliance of his underwear or his flip-flops to hurt himself, but this was not done.
That night, Manning said, his underwear, flip flops and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his detention experiences and drastically reduce his detention level, he should be convicted in his trial before the military court, which is due to be held for the beginning of next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will be guilty of lower charges, while other charges that are considered to be too extreme should be challenged.
The continuation of the hearing is due for this weekend and the prosecution is expected to justify the detention conditions.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning has been detained in accordance with the provisions applicable to all prisoners under the highest security regulations in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include favoring the enemy, unlawful publication of confidential information on the Internet, the transmission of national defence information and theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty in all charges, he is threatened with life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to accuse the immigrants - they call them hard times in memory, he says.
Navarrett believes that Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the passport control when perplexity spread within me.
Signs referred to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("Ausländer").
I stood there for a few seconds, uncertain to which I should go.
I grew up in Central California and was called "Mexicans" all my life.
An ethnic shortcut - just as my friends in Boston call themselves "Iren" or my friends in New York "Italian".
Later I decided to go for "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home there was no need for shorts or hyphens.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to claim myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I'm not going to lose my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and put myself in line for extranjeros.
I was thinking about the moment this week when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet President Obama.
On the agenda were all the topics expected when the heads of these two countries met: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy. She is one reason why Mexicans today are more likely to stay in Mexico than to emigrate to the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc modelled on the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue Mexico's war against the drug cartel, even if he did not mention any details in this regard.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never wasted a single thought that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848 and forced the country's leadership under the pretext of forced them to leave more than half their territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not minutes, memories of this event are not to be overlooked.
So as soon as a U.S. government official exercises only the mildest criticism of Mexico, complaints are heard - in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country - about how Americans are pushing the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the children of Montezumas go to the path of war.
Yet, Mexico’s greatest challenge is in fact to the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Would you like to talk about resentment?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom it does not.
The only reason so many people live of Mexican origin in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at a point in our family tree a person - perhaps a parent or grandparents - was not given a chance in Mexico and emigrated to the north.
And in most cases this person corresponded to a profile - dark skin, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our faithfulness applies to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now live in the American dream, have attended good schools and received good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream we live - not the Mexican one.
Our identity may sometimes be blurred, but as far as our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership do not like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a memorial of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our bands to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And then we wouldn't see ourselves caught behind the silk curtain now - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and moved legally to the United States as a child, reminds me that between Mexicans and Mexican Americans there are tensions because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans take this very bad on them.
While she is an American citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know have the feeling of belonging neither to one country nor to the other.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
One enjoys the best of both worlds, but is not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we're seen as Mexican.
As I should learn during my journey, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of educational citizenship want to resume their connections to Diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as provisional "ambassadors" for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and put pressure on the political leadership to intensify their ties with Mexico.
Well.
This won't happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And given the unfair distribution of income, unbridled corruption and drug abuse, many of us are not so sure whether it is really a great country.
I'm afraid you have to go through this alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least a few Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a hundred and a half centuries ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge for it, as their family members were not treated for so long.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Old Battles, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected pillar of peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to choke such a hope in the germ.
Amidst the usual debt allocations, countless buildings were laid in ruins and ashes, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed - and for the first time, rockets from Gaza were struck near the Israeli metropolis Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although Israelis and Palestinians seem to be trapped in their historical conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
However, there are reasons to believe that the deadly path could finally end it.
A war that is not lost or won
At first glance, optimism in view of the current situation seems to be far from appropriate.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November is continuing, the war of the week has strengthened the prisoners on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement, which has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed back Israelis, although his group had to suffer great losses itself.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are infested in one of the most desolating and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has not yet succeeded in destroying Hamas.
In fact, Hamas in the West Bank is added, controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could conclude that they have time on their side.
As Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends on their side.
Turkey, a reinvigorating regional power once considered to be Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken hold of the Hamas Party - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf States.
Jubilant Hamas followers believe that Israel is an Islamist half-mouth - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has power, over Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist kind could stand before Bashar Assad's overthrow, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And in particular the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - the most populous and most important Arab country at the southern flank of Israel - has changed the balance of the region in a sustainable way.
Hosni Mubarak, the laizist despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the brotherhood with Hamas is weakened and its leaders depend more on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor who cannot himself be pushed out by Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, draw a contrary conclusion.
Militaryly, Hamas is no longer a danger.
The Israeli missile defense system, "Iron Dome", has proven itself and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while Israel will be able to sleep calmly.
In diplomatic terms, the United States maintains its position unshakable, and many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the recent escalations of violence.
Israel has passed well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers - not least thanks to the barrier facilities that have entered the West Bank and thus entered the main part of any Palestinian state. These protect the Jewish settlements, which have been declared illegal by international law, but are continually being expanded.
Netanyahu stands well there. His Likud party has joined Avigdor Lieberman on 22 January in advance of the elections with an even more combative group.
Why also cover up these insidious Palestinians and leave them a state of their own?
If they really had control of the West Bank, wouldn't they fire rockets just like their fellow fighters in the Gaza Strip?
No, it is better to keep them in check behind the wall and punish them, should they dare to lift their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to get through, but the Arab Spring could strike them through the bill.
Even if the Islamists who are now in power in Egypt and in other countries have little left for Israel, they will first concentrate on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel's military seat is larger than that of its four Arab neighbours together.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to restore their economy.
The fact that Pragmatic President Mursi met with Barack Obama in order to reach a ceasefire could be a promising sign - and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think more in the long term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking steady steps towards democratization, Palestinians are still deprived of their right to self-determination - a powdered barrel that will undoubtedly explode one day in the Israeli-occupied territories, just as this week a bus exploded in Tel Aviv.
The oppression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population this situation will only worsen.
Bloody missions to repress Hamas in the Gaza Strip will increasingly demand their diplomatic tribute over the years.
Both sides need an outside boost
The correct answer is that which is represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world and by this newspaper: two states in which Israel departs for security purposes.
The hope - small in the near future - is that the ceasefire will give outsiders more influence to enforce this solution.
Egypt, together with Turkey and Qatar, must now stop the arms deliveries in the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever before to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state on the basis of the 1967 borders, supplemented by territorial exchange and a common Jerusalem.
Outside Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
This would be done more for the creation of a Palestinian State than with the forthcoming request for UN observer status.
Obama must also contribute to moving Israel to negotiations.
During his first term, he failed to present his own peace plan.
Far away in the white house, it seems as if he was similarly opposed to participation.
But that is a regrettable, shortsighted perspective.
The United States has a major interest in a stable Middle East.
And there is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws for uniform cigarette packaging enter into force
Health warnings and affected body parts on neutral green packages that are equal for all tobacco brands
The world's first laws for uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging have come into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colours with neutral olive-green lids printed with drastic pictures, showing sick body parts and babies with cigarette smoke.
Apart from the different health warnings and pictures, the only difference between the packages in the brand names printed in identical, small prints will be the next Saturday.
Australia thus introduces the most stringent regulations for tobacco packaging worldwide.
The Australian federal government wants to take young people off smoking by eliminating the glamorous picture of tobacco consumption.
The government of studies that have shown that people who have not yet started smoking with 26 will probably no longer start after that, with 99% probability.
"You can already see in children of young age that they understand the message to try to apply for tobacco companies with their brand image," says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. She cites studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the least smoking rates in the world and the changes will only have a minor impact on the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
Thus it said that the laws would favour the black market trade, leading to cheaper and easier access to cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have stimulated their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, notes that the demand for cigarette kerosene and silicone lids to cover the unbearable packaging has increased enormously since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco companies failed at the Supreme Australian Court two months ago with their opposition to the laws.
Zico sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale stores and waited for new stocks.
For us, this is a good business.
According to experts, the hook in the popularity of social media lies with exactly the population group to which the plan is directed.
A number of Australian laws have banished tobacco companies from TV advertising, it prohibits them from performing sports sponsors and force most dealers to stop interpreting cigarettes in shops. Now tobacco advertising is switched to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
"Whoever markets tobacco and has only a small area left to apply for its products does not come around the Internet," says Becky Freeman, a health researcher at Sydney University.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has seen an increase in experience reports about brands written by "all normal people".
One has to ask the question: is this just a private person who finds such great pleasure in Marlboro cigarettes that she even recorded a video for it - or does it have a marketing agency to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that instead of marketing, the industry concentrates on dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new regimes - those countries complain about unfair trade restrictions at the World Trade Organisation, although none of the countries is engaged in major trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected for mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has had talks with other countries that consider similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada was the first country to prescribe photographic warnings.
These have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers show defiance.
The pictures don't affect me.
I just ignore them.
"One simply takes a tip and puts the box away," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box, on which a photo is printed with a mouth tumor.
To be honest, there's only one reason I'd stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in downtown Sydney, says that the uniform packaging made it difficult to fill its shelves.
"I used to take an hour to order a delivery, now I need four," Yu says.
"The government should have banned cigarettes completely - then we would have said okay, that's it, we're closing," he apparently added.
In a constantly electrified world it is nice to be even bored
This Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport, when our plane fell out due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another flyer.
So I had enough time to think about boredom.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting for a flight for half a day at the airport is quite annoying - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts lead boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it is okay for us - and our children - to be occasionally bored.
This will force the brain to lose itself in interesting thoughts, which may promote creativity.
And because most of us are almost constantly staring at one screen or another today, the benefits of boredom no longer benefit us.
So should we welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
I'll come back for that.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively current phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) doesn't see it that way.
"In fact, boredom has a very long history," he says.
The walls of Pompeii adorn a Latin graffiti over boredom, dating back to the first century.
And then there's the question of how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York, Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea before a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom can be defined as the experience of "trying to do a satisfying job but not being able to do it".
Boredom differs from apathy, so that the person is not busy, but wants to be.
In the case of apathy, however, there is no need to do anything.
The key experience of boredom, he says, occurs in a "disruption of the attention process, paired with bad moods and the feeling that time passes only slowly".
Boredom can almost listen to it as depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes, although these two states may be related, bored people see the problem in their surroundings or in the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're boring, even if we just have trouble concentrating.
In her study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - to German, for example: "The inactive mind: The definition of boredom under the aspect of attention", published in September in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science", Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment in which participants belonged to a band on which a person reads a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television program from the neighbouring room that had nothing to do with the contents. Others heard it on low volume, so it was hardly perceptible, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
The people who heard the hardly audible television said they felt more bored than the other two groups - they had problems concentrating, couldn’t find any reason for this, and wrote about their difficulties in boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult or strenuous task, the disturbance of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, Associated Professor of Neurosciences at Guelph University in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you are engaged in a monotonous activity - "like the search for defective products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help you not to feel bored".
In fact, he says, we now know that crutches and crutches, often interpreted as signs of boredom, can even fight them by staying physically more attentive.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to squander learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still," says Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at some point - my late flight, a dreamy speaker, a particularly tiring movie.
But some people are bored more easily than others.
To measure these differences, researchers in the 1980s developed a "scala for boredom".
On the scale you will find statements like "Many things I have to do, repeat and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything".
With the help of such scales, researchers have found that boys become more boring than girls, says Stephen Vodanovich, Professor of Psychology at the University of Westflorida - especially as regards the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are a rather tense bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a Pager.
He found that 32% of the adults in school and when doing homework were bored, whereas 23% reported being bored if they were not in school.
However, only 3% of parents indicated that they were feeling bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he does not know whether the percentages of boredom have increased or decreased.
However, he is sure that "youth is considered particularly boring", mainly because children and teenagers have no major influence on their everyday life.
So back to my question of origin: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases it causes people to take extreme physical risks and fall into gambling or drugs to alleviate them - that has shown studies.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, who has been investigating the subject for more than two decades.
"With boredom, the brain wants to tell you that you should do something different," said Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what to do best.
If one is boring and one uses this energy to play guitar and cook, one will be happy.
However, television can bring happiness in the short term, but it is a long-term affair.
Thus, those who reach their bored child an iPad can bring it off from boredom. However, it has not learned to entertain or control themselves, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "Self-control transfers from one situation to another".
The child learns not only to entertain but also to gain more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
Nor should we see them too critical.
Instead, our aim should be to feel at ease away from constant activity and technology adaptation.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we have to be bored more often. But boredom is the painful, relentless desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that people are really just looking for a way to turn off and relax.
"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated, it is difficult to get busy when the noise is muted."
In Colorado there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco stands in South East Colorado for a trial, which will soon be legal in this state: the possession of a few fewer marijuana chunks and a pipe with which he smoked them.
Orozco said he and some friends were on a September day by car in Lamar near the border with Kansas when they were stopped.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was charged for the possession of drugs and drug devices - cavaliers ’ crimes, each with a penalty of $100 - and received a court date.
"We're treated like criminals," says Orozco.
But is he one?
In the weeks following the state's decision to legalize small quantities of marijuana for personal use, the answer for hundreds of smaller drug traffickers depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of violations of order that revolve around marijuana are already being dropped here and in Washington State, which approved similar measures.
Police authorities no longer pursue adults over 21 years of age for possession to a small extent. This is permitted by law as soon as the new laws come into force in the next few weeks.
But state attorneys in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced that they will continue to pursue existing marijuana law and still cite people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains, agree to prevent new state-licensed marijuana shops from opening up in their communities.
"This situation develops so quickly that I don't know what will happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, Chief of Police in Aurora, east of Denver.
And regulators in Washington State are also rattling their heads.
They are waiting for guidance to set up a licensing system for the production, production, distribution and sale of the drug - with a deadline until 1 December 2013.
In Washington, it is believed that Colorado is in any case ahead of most states in terms of marijuana regulation, where the drug was first legalized for medical purposes and then for personal use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore well suited for orientation," says Brian E. Smith, Spokesman of the Washington State Department of Spirits.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
"We don't have a real precedent that we can follow," he adds.
The Washington Act, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December, thus also forming the end point of a grey zone in which the state licensing system does not yet exist, but property is legalized.
And unpleasant practical issues need to be clarified at this time - for example, how to agree on the state requirement of "reasonable access" to licensed marijuana with the ban of cannabis shops around 300 meters around schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
"Nowhere will it be more difficult to find a place for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in Seattle's convalescence," says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the "Center for Legal cannabis", a recently formed research group.
On November 21st, Chief Oates sent an e-mail to his staff in Aurora saying that the prosecutor would no longer pursue smaller marijuana officers in people over 21 years old, and that the police "immediately" would not seek criminal charges for these crimes.
Chief Oates added that the police would continue to enforce urban regulations on the regulation of producers of medical marijuana and continue to pursue drug dealers.
In Weld County, Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck represents a more stringent view.
After the vote, he said that his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to move consumers to withdrawal.
At present, 119 people have to be tried for possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana, although many have been charged with other crimes.
"Our authority has a duty to prosecute crimes at the time of the crime," Buck stated in a statement.
The reactions are even in places such as rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
The Grand Junction police, the largest city in the county, no longer show adults the possession of smaller quantities.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but he also decided not to drop all outstanding property proceedings.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time trying to enforce the law until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of the voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexity of government and legal systems.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state promoted a profound gap among local officials with regard to the great green experiment to day.
District state attorneys are concerned with a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents the defendant in court for marijuana and is a local spokesman for the national organisation for reforming marijuana laws.
"They have spent such a large part of their lives persecuting people for criminal purposes that they still cannot accept the legalization," he believes.
As the first states to treat smaller quantities of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are acting as national sample cases for the legalization of drugs.
While preconsultants and state officials are preparing for legal sales at an age, they are also anxiously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which wants to continue to treat marijuana sales and cultivation at federal level as a criminal offence.
Speakers of the legalization movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will give in.
Despite several spectacular arrests by consumers and salesmen of medical marijuana, the Federal Government has largely allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy consultant of the Obama government, believes that although criminals are not likely to enter doors to confiscate smaller amounts of drugs, they are likely to be estranged into legal, state-regulated marijuana businesses under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado do not wait for the federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local authorities approved moratoria for new marijuana businesses, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week Montrose, a city in the West, decided to ban six months, which is likely to be adopted next week.
"We don't want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a big problem at federal level," says Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our community has voted against this amendment of the law.
We decide what the community has decided for and not what the state has decided for.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford because I am Tory
Not only university students today are attacked for their views
It has always been my greatest dream to have a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had attended the university that I once held for the world's greatest stamp of knowledge, for a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my admission to Worscester College at the end of the 1980s - there I had planned to study history - I had repacked my suitcases and thus brought the first scandal of my life.
My father broke into tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard, it was said that I had gone because I had a problem having sex with fellows in the neighboring room.
The author A N Wilson schelmisch explained that I had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, ran, because I suffered from systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
I had only been harassed for one reason - a reason that seemed so narrow and cruel in this supposed cradle of enlightenment: My now dead father Woodrow Wyatt was an important consultant to Margaret Thatcher and I support the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this right now?
Well, according to current reports, a new generation of students are suffering moderated rights under similar persecution.
The organized and rising hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that last week a group of them called for the same level of protection of rights that would benefit gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College state that they are often "actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable due to their political views".
They call for a place on the equal opportunities committee of their college to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Her situation was exacerbated by a recent documentary about political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which represented Tories as eccentric and Neonazis.
Among other things, this was shown by the graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative student association of Oxford University, who drove in a Rolls-Royce and protruded with silver suit and silver-occupied walking stock.
At other universities, conservative students say that they are considered to be "sunblocks for the introduction of higher tuition fees".
The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice President of the Conservative Student Association of Nottingham University, stated in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing left-wing tendency at universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even getting to know us."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and history student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the quest for greater protection, is of the opinion that such a climate is "unacceptable". Stephanie Cherill, 19-year-old president of Oxford's conservative student association, said she had observed a growing rejection of students of moderate rights at JCR members.
"This represents a danger to intellectual discourse and the well-being of members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old I had arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its climax.
In the previous year, the university had voted to give Margaret Thatcher - a former student - no honorary title due to cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would have scared Stalinists to death.
In the first days of the first semester week, when new students met and the tutors, I had a taste for the future.
I had the experience that the tutors were not only tolerating Tory students, but even taking part in them with joy.
Political issues such as the miner strike, the privatisation and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa found their way into the wooded rooms of the tutorial.
At my first of these events, I was supposed to translate French texts from the 18th century into English. I had not been drawn to what was to come.
"Miss Wyatt," said Tutor Harry Pitt (now dead), "please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled.
Pitt was a little man with a face like cake dough, and pretty ugly.
"Does thatcher followers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students were looking.
There were tears in my eyes.
"I suggest that they take a few French hours in your spare time - so if you're not too busy with your social activities," Pitt murmured me.
I returned to my room with my head hanging.
This evening, I was sitting at college alone at dinner when someone tipped me off on my shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year called James, who presented himself as a member of the Conservative Student Association.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it's the way it is.
Anyone who is suspected of being Tory is being thrashed.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, which is why it's gonna be worse for you.
Most Tory first semesters pretend to be followers of the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I later tried to adjust.
I insisted that I wasn't in all points with Mrs. Thatcher agreed.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A student beginner in philosophy, politics and economy, who ironically visited Eton College as conservative, said to me: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverse and dirty.
"How do Tories have sex?" one asked me.
They beat each other, don't they?
I felt as if homosexuals must have felt before the liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever manage to live a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years that lay before me extended before my spiritual eye to a purgatory of agony and isolation.
The only Tutor who was openly recognized as a Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History, who was based in my college.
He was hated not only to be a conservative but also because he had advised and written speeches for thatcher in the field of foreign policy.
He was there only rarely.
He hated the place, found it provincial and petty and rejected it for his Marxist-determinist perspective of history.
In 1997 he received a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I began to commute between Oxford and the house of my parents and found refuge with open friends and family members in the city.
My father told me that I hate Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed faithless.
During his time in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said small.
They would never do such a thing, not in my city of dreaming towers.
Even my communist friends always put forth flawless manners.
His humid eyes were dripping.
Give the whole thing a chance.
I'm sure you're just being necked.
It would break my heart if you left.
Suffered by my frequent travels to London, my emotional resistance became weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory's followers, had given in to the pressure and rejected his beliefs.
During a tutorial the following week, in which another historian had seriously claimed that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I secretly broke out of shame, I admitted that my parents had subjected myself to a "brain wash" and called her "old fool".
The relief lasted only a short time.
It was my father who hit the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I was hiding in my room, and after five minutes, my horses gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
I'd like you to call me a whimsical wimp.
But no 18-year-olds should ever have to suffer from such intimidation and malaise in an educational establishment.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university that not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but still hid behind an undeserved call of equal rights and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance of fame"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of the Couture", which was opened this week in London, ABC talks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion maker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital that is worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This has been recognized by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of the Couture", a magnificent retrospective for which more than 130 dresses of the Haute Couture have been made by his "Maison" over the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, who could not have been written without his distended clients.
Valentino has always felt fascination for the nobility's nobility and distant world.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which is to be seen until March 3, there are a large number of private letters and photos with the signature of the most beautiful aristocracy, starting from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan, the Princess Marie-Chantal from Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social ascent from modest fashion maker in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jetset.
Being in love with the nobility does not have to be a disadvantage.
"First of all, they don't step out of their chickens on your magnificent carpet, as some beautiful celebrities do from pop music," says Baronin Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s they lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all happy when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, close friends with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of fame.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress of Valentino
Even the Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the fashionmaker.
Many years ago, after a fashion show at the Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went to his house for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Every detail of his apartment, decoration, food and music recognized and felt his influence.
"All invited persons felt important and loved," recalls the "top model", which started their career at the Haute Couture 1995 week in Paris.
"He never comes out of fashion because his designs are artworks," she concludes.
Fashion View of Origin
The life of Garavani is not a history of obsessiveness, rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House was transformed into a glorious and 60-metre-long walkway, which proposes a roll exchange: the user takes the place of the model and goes along the walkway to admire a dreamy "audin" wearing masterpieces by Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, the costumes that Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte", or a coat of wool and leather that belonged to Emperor Farah Diba.
In this audience from fashion dolls, names such as those of Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the fashionmaker, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I can still remember perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a vest type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's museums.
"I prefer him to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he emphasizes our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Even the princess and judge at the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager in Italy, I dreamt of finally having the age and opportunity to wear one of his evening clothes...
At the end of the 1990s, it finally came to an end.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party at my Veters' Castle, the Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying skirt and a draped top with a décolleté that honors his name.
"It was a true dream," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino does not depend on fashion, its obsession is timeless," explains the Italian aristocracy who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening dresses of the fashionmaker "with absolute care", "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the memories associated with it".
The "King" of fashion
The big finale of the exhibition in Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashionmaker called his close-ups) were necessary to make this ivory silk dress with beads, twelve different embroidery and a four and a half-metre long tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the chief authority of the specialist press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the supreme society".
For years with the "savoir-être" of the elite, Valentino is now her best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest honor of Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the Legion of Honor, sums up Garavani as many honours as any of its customers' husbands.
"I always noticed his refinement, his tranquillity, his well-kept and perfect exterior," admits D'Arenberg.
I saw him last time a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He sat at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was unblemished; time leaves no traces of him."
And this is what a princess says...
The most difficult occupation in the world: the human work animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health when carrying 70 kilos of sulphur over the steep, rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is Hell, and others work in Hell literally.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by bringing sulfur from the volcano Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
For this he must rise every day down to the ground of his crater, where the sulfurous gas flowing from the earth in contact with the air is fortified.
After breaking out large sulphur stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilos in total, he transports them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the wasted paths of stone.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 meters, but the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes for the ascent in the turtle's pace, keeping the balance and carefully setting their steps so that they do not slip out and fall off.
They know that every step can cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 Eurocent for every kilo of sulphur they mine.
Upstairs, they pave the way between the tourists who photograph them like circus coffees and run with the tiringly heavy baskets three kilometers to the scale, which a mining company has placed a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Nagrimbi, who has since 1960 exploited the incidences in the volcano and (no better said) his workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocent) for each kilo of sulphur.
It then sells it to the petrochemical industry for 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocent) each, because this mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for the bleaching of sugar.
"Since we usually carry 70 kg, we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each route," Anto explains to us, who usually makes three routes a day.
He needs three hours for each route, after which he is completely done, but at the end of the day he has 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros).
What looks like a miserable wage for such a seemingly inhumane effort, but is the triple of what he would earn with fieldwork.
"The daily wage of mine workers here, where 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) are paid on the day at the coffee harvest and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros) is very high," explains the carrier, who previously worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) on the day, and the work was not as hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, for a reason as important as the sulfur in Indonesia: "I have married a girl from Bali where they are Hindus, and I have brought them to Java to convert them to Islam".
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
For the past three years, 27-year-old Anto has been putting his life on the Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already left him the first traces, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated from the volcano because of the toxic gases.
This is the price he must pay to achieve his dream.
"I'm going to work here for two more years because I'm going to open a shop or learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than just acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent, but punishable young man could work as a tourist guide, waitress or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a carrier.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other wearers and gets up every morning at two o'clock, because the sulphur also pours out at night, where his characteristic yellow color shines bluishly in the darkness.
Challenged by the shadow, he rises in the light of a small headlight on his helmet, which he bought from his own money, into the crater.
On the crater floor about 400 carriers load the basket with sulphur on their shoulders.
Despite their large profits, the mining company has not mechanized the sulphur reduction to save costs, and does not provide any equipment to the carriers who work on their own account and are paid for by weight.
They also receive no part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge per camera, which the guards of this nature park, together with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), demand from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human carrier.
"This work is for animals and not for humans" protests Madrusin, a native, 42-year-old carrier who has been working at the Kawah Ijen since leaving school for three decades.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he continues, "as long as it goes", because he needs the money for raising his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulfur burns the throat and the eyes turn when the wind turns suddenly and the miners stick into the thick columns that rise from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about severe diseases ... of course except the usual breathing problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and blisters on the shoulders that have deformed from the weight of the basket.
With the basket on his back, Unainik is only able to carry 50 kg with his 53 years.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which are transported from three trucks over a goat path between the bush to the camp in Tamansari at 18 kilometers away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life," explains Unainik, opening his mouth far, in which some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the elder also works as a sulfur carrier with his 30 years.
The time passes, but impoverishment lasts generation upon generation in one of the world's toughest occupations: those who work as human vices on Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singaporeans blame them for having no children, for their careers, for the stress and costs of real estate and child education.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: We fulfill our civil obligation and we create lives!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for minzbons, but still – or that is why – they became a viral video on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The sentences are part of a rapper song, the local sayings such as "Sleep will be a "bao" (Laib) in the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, who shot the video, has the hope that the commercial will reach in a funny way to draw attention to the problem.
Her creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to bring people to fulfil their "national duty".
This is only for the Internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world when we are replanting, so we noticed that this is a topic that we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as the marketing of perfume with pheromones or the organization of speed dating evenings (fast flirts).
Possibly that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought: Why not do something as creative as possible to deal with this problem, such as composing a rap?
1.2 Children
Who does not take this subject easily is the government of Singapore.
Every year, it spends $1,300 on political measures to encourage citizens to have more children.
A package of government grants up to $15,000 per child for couples and parents, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything has not been successful so far.
Singapore is a rich, highly technological city state in South-East Asia, also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social control.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time that this rate was above 2 - which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporeans have more kids?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Authority, says that this is due to "better education" and "greater career opportunities".
"This has enabled people to have significantly more options in relation to life goals and to set priorities except to marry and make a family," she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to a higher number of single and delayed marriages and births, the result of which is the reduction of the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, immigration policies aimed at a drastic increase in immigration in order to counteract the decline in the population led to resentment in the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the barely clogged Xenophobia blossoms against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping the wages low and not integrating themselves.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the government party in Singapore has achieved its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem of higher contributions and contributions for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the falling birth rate has the well-known impact on the economic growth of a nation, tax revenue, health costs and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to reach that not so many small apartments are being built.
It has already had an impact on the housing market.
The Urban Development Authority has started to control the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" and may be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sale success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the single person and that they deter the construction companies from building large homes for families.
But Lim Youw Soon, Director General of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out by day and even weeks faster than the larger housing units.
This means that they are much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new norms give developers clearer orientations that were previously put in the way of obstacles if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, discussions with the Singaporeans working in the financial district should be noted that they will not have a major impact.
"People are stressed out, apartments and education are expensive too, so it is pushed out by many," says a young manager.
The children can get others.
"It is important for me to have my own money and time," says another man, about twenty years old.
Men and women lead their careers, stress and costs of ownership and education as reasons why they cannot have children.
Therefore, the Singaporeans have the last word when it comes to having children - the government can still do so much.
Offline Private offline is online private
Privacy
According to the dictionary, this is the property of private or private life where protection from any kind of interference is claimed.
What is private for someone under 16 years of age?
How is this definition applied to its everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he faces when he announces on the Internet situations that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15 who are often on the net.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with "something very own" on a personal level and "on the password and the user" when they applied it to the social networks.
"I wouldn't disclose my deepest secrets in a post," says the 10 year old Jorge trying to explain the meaning of "private" in websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I'm also wasting my time with acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that's not mine, or someone who makes the stupid head," he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to make obscene photos, of naked, of crime, or write insulting or violent comments.
Jorge assures us to know 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers in Twitter.
Most are relatives.
Including the mother who has the password for one of the accounts.
I signed up at Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if anyone will answer me, I'll just let her up," he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can talk quickly to relatives in the distance or to friends" he says.
He answered that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown.
Even if someone were to call him a stranger, he would ignore this.
The case of the 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he admits not to know 20 of the people he has attached to his friend list.
"That doesn't scare me because we have something mean, for example music," he says.
According to the boy, no one has given him any information or asked him for his address or telephone number.
"If someone bothers me or asks of me, I simply remove it from my user account" he admits.
José joined Ask after he had read a recommendation in Twitter.
The boy is not an unknown experience that is known today as cyberbullying.
The acquaintance of a friend was blackmailed in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he assures.
According to José, the victim has not closed the user account.
"He only did it privately."
After that, he explains a number of steps to configure a user account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I'd do that if he was unsympathetic to me or I wanted to wipe him out one.
"But I know this is cyberbullying," he explains.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, teacher of English with a degree in education and learning, believes that in order to orient the children and young people, it must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks to inform.
"The Internet was created as a tool for searching for information; but with the appearance of these pages the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that the academic Marc Prensky, holder of a master's title in pedagogy at the University of Yale and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants", formed these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who are supposed to teach them, where we are still learning ourselves," he says.
He explains that this is a complex issue, "because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what can be spread, published or said, and this at an age where maturity is not sufficient for it."
"They should also be elective when it is most important to them to be popular with thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way is to teach children and young people what privacy is to ask them questions that make them think.
"To say they shouldn't do it doesn't work," he says.
Porras then mentions some possibilities: there are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger. Then why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would it please you if you published a photo of yourself, such as the one you published by a friend?
Do you know what the others are publishing about you?
Did you ask the other people permission before when you labeled photos of celebrations?
And one more question: Do everyone have to know what you're doing at any moment?
Another point is to give them to understand that they have to act online how they do it offline.
It's the same rules.
"Everyone outside the Internet deals with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, elementary school teacher and educator, commented that it is essential that parents read the guidelines of social networks carefully.
If they understand all sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening one user account on the Internet.
"For example, age, or what you can share or publish" he explains.
According to Guardia, the children have to be reminded of the lesson "You shouldn't talk to strangers".
Conclusion of the Unasur Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the Lima Declaration previously announced and to be theoretically signed by the seven governments present.
Efe repeatedly attempted to gain access to the signed document at the VIth Ordinary Meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the Unasur. Sources in the State and Presidential Office initially announced that they would hand it over after the term, but afterwards stated that it would be published for some time on the website of the Peruvian Government.
On questions relating to the text, they stated that the content was presented to the press by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala.
The access of journalists to information about the summit was limited at any time.
During the day only the image of the Presidential Meeting without sound was transmitted in the press room with the message "private meeting, limited audio".
The few information circulated among the journalists was received by the press spokesmen of some of the unaseur governments present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian press spokesperson.
The only document that was distributed during the day was the list of the participating presidents, which caused discomfort to the hundreds of journalists of various national and international media who demanded more information.
Afterwards, the Presidential Office of Peru sent the media an e-mail with the "Declaration" of the summit, but this was the explanation of Humala and not the official document at the end of the summit.
Last October, Peru was the host of the Third Summit of South America - Arab States (ASPA), and even on this occasion, despite a strong call by the press, the so-called Lima declaration that had been announced earlier was also not published.
On the official website of the ASPA, one can be sure that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed the existence of information systems for journalists, but to a large extent they restricted access to information.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a ruling by the Court of Justice of The Hague, which provides for a border conflict between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the IGH, which began in The Hague on Monday, in the process that led Lima against Santiago to listen to the plädoyers of both sides.
"We will follow and execute the ruling on the differences we are currently presenting to this international court," said Humala together with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and remains a country that adheres to international laws, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, concludes agreements and submits to international courts," Piñera added, greeting Humala with a handshake in front of the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by both Presidents that they would submit to the IGH occurred after Colombia had brought an action against the Bogotá Agreement after a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which considered it a serious mistake, which agreed to submit to the judgments of this international court.
At the summit the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from the Unasurian since 2011 since the resignation of its President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host President, Ollanta Humala, opened the discussions in the morning and finished the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The head of state leaves the final document, which stated that 16 decisions were taken and 31 projects between the South American countries were decided on an investment amount of a total of 17 billion dollars.
On the decisions taken, he said that the countries of impasure "will take significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship, to which we will extend the decisions on residence rights."
He said that measures would be taken to "improve cooperation in the fight against urban uncertainty and organised transnational crime, as well as measures to improve access to drugs and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act together and efficiently in the event of natural disasters".
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) should not accept triumphant moves, but should serve to expand our production performance and show our peoples a better future," added Humala.
"We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 emblematic projects aimed at improving spatial links in South America and especially in rural and border regions...and thus bringing together our countries and opening up new economic forms," said the Peruvian President in a read-out statement.
Among these projects were five Peruvian, which were located on the colossals of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which were to ensure a better connection with Ecuador, although it did not provide any further details.
The concluding document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve for its resumption in the Union of South American Nations", which is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to continue to be an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighbourly relations was another aspect highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before the beginning of his participation in the regional meeting that he expected on Saturday in Mexico a meeting with his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, to respectfully treat the maritime conflict following a judgment of the IGH challenged by Bogotá.
"Maybe I'll meet President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday)," said Santos.
"We will review all these ways - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua also makes dialogue with Nicaragua necessary," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell the President Ortega that we will treat this matter as civilized and respectful as possible," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they intend to be present at the office of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit meeting, the defence ministers of the bloc met in advance to adopt the 2013 Action Plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, even if the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru has the presidency at the time of the regional block.
"South America must learn about the integration of its citizens," says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, today confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is an objective, where "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who attended the 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which took place in Lima, stated to the state television in Peru that the Europeans "were killed in the Second World War and in other conflicts" and "now are practically a fatherland."
In this sense, he defended the project of creating a South American citizenship that drives the member states of the Unasur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean Community; however, there are still reactionary sectors that seek a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also supported the redesign of the Organization of American States (OEA) with the aim of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account those which have signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit themselves to anything, and in return we always sign everything to the South Americans.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights is based in Washington and financed by the United States," he explained as an advocacy of the political asylum that Ecuador granted to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because he had not betrayed his principles but had followed his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that there had been "reasoned suspicions that Assange would be delivered to a third country and would not comply with his procedures."
He also criticized the Swedish justice that he had demanded to interrogate him on his territory for a alleged sexual offence, while "Swedish case law allows this by means of a video conference that could have been conducted on the Ecuador Embassy in London."
Correa explained that there was a risk that Assange’s health and mental condition would be compromised.
"Since he has been in our message, I have not spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but not a serious one," said Ecuador's head of state.
However, there is a danger that he will take physical and mental damage because he is trapped in a narrow space and cannot perform physical outdoor exercises.
"That would affect every person's health," he added.
Correa stated that the solution for asylum granted by Assange since June in the Ecuador Embassy in London was the granting of a free letter with which he could travel to Ecuador, and that this was in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities. He stressed that there had been talks with London to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We are not dealing with human rights, we are not using this word in this case, but we have had constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the judicial authorities of Europe , because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, leads a number of proceedings on various European bodies," he said.
And "If the United Kingdom grants this free letter tomorrow, I think it's done."
And if Sweden questioned Mr Assange at the Ecuador Embassy in London or Skype, how it allowed Swedish case law and was done in other cases, then the problem would be solved.
Correa took the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of the freedom of the press and said that what he does not tolerate is "the mediocrity, the evil intent and the lies that exonerate the free expression of opinion."
"The biggest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who seek and extortion profit," he said.
In this sense he congratulated himself on the fact that Ecuador was no longer dominated by such journalists "and also not dominated by the bankers or hegemonic and sparsely-bourgeois countries," and he took the lead in "re-electioning" to "enhance the revolution in order to continue the path in this right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the impasse at least until its next elections, arguing that the organism "must remain hard and must not allow opportunism and no State empire as legally disguised", because it "has been destroyed by the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay."
The President of Ecuador also considers that the wish of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which favored Nicaragua's maritime authority to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between both countries, is "absolutely justified."
At present, this judgment is not implemented.
It is a problem between a South and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They must be treated in full so that they can be overcome and looked forward.
He also relied on a good conclusion to the dispute over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same Court and said that "it is right for Latin America to call on international bodies if both countries undertake to accept the judgment even if it is very harsh."
With regard to the possibility that he would stand as a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador in order to achieve his third consecutive mandate, he stated that he saw this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is very difficult."
Correa assured that if he allowed the elections to take place in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
Power has never interested me personally, but under such unjust circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the belief that I was the one who guaranteed this probable victory, so I have to live up to this responsibility," he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last term as president, after which I withdraw from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"That's decided," he said.
Correa also addressed the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just spoke to Vice President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he had gone there for a planned routine treatment, and that he was expected to be able to return to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It does not in any case mean a relapse in the health of President Chávez," he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State took part today in Lima at the 6th Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with the call for greater regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
Cause of AIDS death is too late today
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed by the results of the study: HIV positive.
"It was as if a bomb hit," he says about the moment he received the diagnosis that the doctor tried to "weaken" without recognizable success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it; and this with such use that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to imagine in the early 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
At that time, the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye, "because it led to a dead end."
AIDS was synonymous with death at that time.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic who know nothing about their disease and who have already done damage to the virus and have exhausted their immune system, and who are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who is receiving treatment in good time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HCG HIV Unit, who said that this information had been supported by a respected scientific publication in April of this year.
The expert on infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, the scientists concluded that AIDS was not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life depended on the degree of impairment of the immune system of the individuals at the start of the treatment, and that those greater chances that are non-drug-dependent: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years with a count of 500 CD4.
To put it simply, the above statements mean that those who receive HIV positive at the age of 25 "can easily age 75 as long as they are under control," said this specialist.
In order to properly align this progress, it must be recalled that the life expectancy of the Mexicans today is an average of 76 years.
Even if mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (ONUSIDA Annual Report), it is nevertheless true that since the occurrence of AIDS, 60 percent of patients recorded in the national database have died.
In 2011, 255 people died alone in Jalisco, and by the month of May of this year there are 187 deaths; however, it is assured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral medicines since 2005.
So why do people still die on it?
- In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we have not had any drug supply problems. The problem is that people come in advanced conditions because they do not know their condition of infection, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. In order to influence global mortality, more early diagnosis is required, which is why all people in whom this is necessary must be offered massive detection tests."
This proposal was approved by the experts and officials of the Consejo Estate de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and by the patients such as Fabrizio, who had his test carried out in a private laboratory, for the sole reason that it had made a friend of him who, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS phase and even had the Kaposi Sarkom (a cancerous tumor), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything is different if you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die, and don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, I'd rather burst three times," they say in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, do sports and take the drugs.
Today his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work, do a lot, have an active but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO in order to animate with his testimony those who are today afraid of the global AIDS day.
They should take the test if they belong to the risk group. The earlier they know if they are HIV positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Major gaps exist between the health programmes and the simple citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who has accepted the case of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In these places, "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; they were previously given individually, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
Young people are at risk for new infections.
"What do you need this for?" is a common joke by social workers, guidance staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the health care system that young people do not want to put up with, insured the correspondent.
He proposed to reorientate this inefficient distribution; the condoms should be located not only behind the shop table, but in public toilets of facilities frequently visited by young people.
Promiscuity should not be promoted.
They should not be paid for the beer and motel, as Governor Emilio González answered the question of whether to distribute preservatives under his administration.
"Sexuality does not look like that; it is best to bring the condoms closer to those who already engage in sexual activity," he pointed it out.
Key data of Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is based nationally on 4th place new and cumulative AIDS cases, and 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of the cases occur via sexual intercourse, 6% via blood, and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people registered for each case who do not know.
After the United States Court of Appeal has confirmed a judgment which does not recognise the restructuring of Vitro Group's liabilities achieved through a trade bankruptcy in Mexico, an unhealthy precedent for each national company with branches in the neighbouring country has been created which has a payment problem.
It could therefore be said that the procedures for the survival of the companies that allow the Mexican laws are not valid in the country of stars and stripes, contrary to international agreements.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment given by Judge Harlin Hale at the Bancarrotas court for the northern district of Texas on 15 June leads to the fact that Mexican companies are exposed to confiscation of their property beyond the River Bravo without any help.
However, the decision opens the door and gate to the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the United States Supreme Court for three inconsistencies.
While the judge points out that the creditors must be subject to the bankruptcy law of the United States, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, first states that the main proceedings are the commercial bankruptcy dealt with in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in procedures for incapacity for payment of companies with a cross-border profile is not known.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Trade Law was created, using the American Law Institute as a simpler.
Secondly, the judgment provides that, without the votes of the companies, after recognition of the liabilities in the bankruptcy capital held by Vitro's branches with its parent company, the required majority for the restructuring of the liabilities would not have been reached.
However, this possibility is recognised by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities have been confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Bundesinstitut für Handelskonkurse).
It is also correct that, after the votes of the branches were withdrawn, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who complained to the United States courts against Vitro, i.e. the Geier funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached a majority.
The vote would have gone 45% against 37%.
This is not taken into account by the appeal court.
On the other hand, there is Vitro blame for his difficult situation as of 2008 in the context of the major economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country blows.
For this reason, the González Sada family opposes the same appeal court in order for the vote to take place in plenary, i.e. by all judges, because only three voted.
If that is not allowed, the Cerciorare appeal, which requires the review of the proceedings by a higher instance, shall be filed in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The serious factor in this case is that the court left aside a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (Friend of the Court), which describes Vitro's proceedings under the law on bankruptcy, and points out that it had adhered strictly to the agreements signed by both countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the bankruptcy law of the United States.
It should also be noted that the country has submitted to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the established rules on cross-border incapacity to pay, which guarantee equality between debtors and creditors.
Two-band carambola: a blow for Vitro and for the country.
General balance sheet
After the ads by the Mexican Air Transport Trade Unions against the former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, did not advance for several months, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (the Association of Pilots) has finally made progress.
The request made by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now filed a criminal procedure against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstructing the judiciary.
Subsequently, the Supervisory Authority has systematically refused to inform the Governing Board of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the Entrepreneur in order to withdraw from the Trust Account F/589 of Bank IXE 1,98 million pesos under the name of Mexicana de Aviación.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares of Administeradora Profesional de Hoteles (the professional hotel administration).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a weekend meeting at a forum of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society have decided to create a broad front to resist the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and sales center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from beyond the wall, supplemented by a residential area for employees of 150 companies.
In advance, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Manufacturing Industry) has reached the goal of uniting the governors in the south-east to resist the monumental institution that partly destroyed protected areas and represented the mother of all threats to industry.
ACTA is dead
Because the government of a Senate request to explain under which conditions and circumstances the Mexican ambassador in Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known under the English abbreviation ACTA, the matter has already been archived according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures were taken even though the Senate had ignored the possibility because it considered them to be a violation of the freedom of expression in the social networks.
Homex long term
In an effort to pay long-term liabilities without affecting the short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex puts over 500 million pesos stock market certificates on the market.
The issue is the first of four same emissions that promise an interest payment every 28 days.
Foundation of Competival
Formed by NYCE, e-Quality and Coret, leading information technology companies, a group of companies was founded under the name Competival, whose goal is the service market of the software clusters in Central and South America.
This investment is over 1.5 billion dollars.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The world bummer of the basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was connected to the basket sport for more than 60 years and has traveled the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large spiritual collection of the history of the country's basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before being tied to the wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for six years, whether as players of lower classes, players of the first national league, proxy and head of the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of the Basketball Association.
"For my life I set up a lot of hats in basketball, even several at the same time as I was president of the BSN, head of the national team and president of the Federation in the 1990s," Reyes remembered when visiting Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify to them.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those of his time at the Vaqueros from the mid-50s as a player to 1982, where he celebrated his 15th anniversary as co-director or managing director of the club.
"These were my best years that I enjoyed most, because I was allowed to be part of eight of the Vaqueros championships since 1967 as managing director, co-manager or trainer.
It was many years of fulfillment, including the five successive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I passed with a championship in 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome Mincy at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" took over Ortiz, who was a very good administrator," says Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a very strong and 2 m big player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players that Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended the freelance specialist Raymond Gausse, who had become a citizen and was one of our best throwers.
I remember how he said that if Mincy had made it possible for Bayamon to take care of Ghausse for another one.
The Vaqueros Championship with Gausse was granted to him, but already out of a distance because he was already at the top of the association in 1988.
At that time he intended to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember the first time we won the pre-lympic tournament in Mexico against the USA.
Then came the 1990 World Championship, in which we occupied the fourth place, which should have been bronze, if not this Canadian referee, who let us repeat the last move for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this group of the 1990 World Cup the best national team you've ever seen?
She is among the best, as well as those who won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite is the team of the 1991 pan-American games in Cuba, where we won gold and offered the team of the USA a battle, as at the time, when they won bronze against us at the World Championship.
At that team, not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and Piculin (Ortiz) participated, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not attend in 1990 because of knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but with whom we won a gold medal and which gave us great joy was that of the 1995 pre-lympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitin as a substitute for the locked players because of the incidents on the Pan American games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against every forecast.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was no doubt Piculin Ortiz.
His figures at the level of the international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level as Piculin.
And this, without taking into account his career in the various bodies in which he played.
Who was the best coach in Puerto Rico?
That is a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like Leo Arill's work from the boys.
What do you think is the best thing you've achieved in the Federation?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN at the beginning of the 1990s up to 17 teams in one season.
What else are you doing?
There are things I would have introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, only play in their territory and only meet in the national playoffs on teams from other corners of the island.
Today the children make unnecessary many trips and games.
At least I see the result of the required trainings and courses for trainers, table officers and referees.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to hear music, watch videos of music in my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who was always with me.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and became famous worldwide with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas", where he played a scrupulous, hideous and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the J.R. Ewing oil magnate in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned as J.R. this year in a new season of "Dallas", died on Friday afternoon due to cancer complications according to a family press release to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved birth town of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role that most liked him," said the family.
The family of Larry and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebrations of the harvest Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and follow-up series, was with Hagman when he died in the Dallas hospital, said her publisher Jeffrey Lane.
He made all the joys he knew.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life in full accord," explained Gray in a communication.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted that he drank a lot over the years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was detected in his liver, and he underwent transplantation.
In the years before "Dallas" Hagman became known on television as a nice guy in the years 1965 to 1970 with the Sitcom "Improving Jeannie" of the NBC television company.
There he played astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is put on his head when he meets an attractive "Jinn" (played by Barbara Eden), who will live with him at home.
He was also an actor of two comedies who were broadcast only for a short time, such as The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His cinematographic works included well-rated roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the enchantingly abominable J.R. who made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of CBS television chain over the Ewing-Clan and other figures around it was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertisement "Who shot at J.R.?", which should create expectation for an episode full of emotions, where the figure of Hagmann was almost killed, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were bet in bet houses.
This made the series reach an audience record in that time.
When the answer became known in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers turning the "Dallas" into the second most seen entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin who had shot J.R.'s sister-in-law (interpreted by Mary Crosby).
J.R. had thwarted her and threatened to portray her as a prostitute if she did not leave the city. But others also had reason to want to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a retarded businessman and unfaithful husband who sought to have his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) reported.
"I know what to do on J.R.'s gravestone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be called "Here rests the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only business he didn't win.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as an "ignorable personality on and outside the screen".
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of worshipers in the world and remains in our hearts, who have the happiness of knowing and loving him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast with great success in the TNT television channel a few months ago.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was just turned, informed the station.
There was no immediate explanation by Warner or TNT about how the loss of Hagmann would be treated in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she got Larry during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck at the theatre stage in New York at the beginning of the 1950s, after which he served in the air forces in England from 1952 to 1956.
He met young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in Malibu, California, where many celebrities live.
In 2001 he named his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't write anything that I believed could harm anyone or harm him in any way," said the Associated Press at the time.
After liver transplantation, he applied for liver donations and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist distressing patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I will meet with them when their operations are imminent and afterwards," he said in 1996.
I would like to give them some consolation, such as "no fear, it's a little uncomfortable the first time, but you'll be fine".
He also opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Beginning of the course, which studies the "end of the world"
Every week, students examine apocalyptic issues such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and global warming.
Every semester, when the professor of religion decided to take a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible fishing hook: the end of the "long backward count" of the Maya calendar on December 21, many people believed it meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect in the following two months: the destructive Hurricane Sandy, some of whom have called "deudarmaggedon", and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place of which Christian theorists believe the apocalypse begins.
"I have not noticed that this will be the most apocalyptic semester that ever existed," said Charmé this week to students at the University of Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).
If someone were to analyze what happened in the world today as if we were thirty days away, this would be a really good period.
And he reminds us that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, which should actually be the last in history.
In Temple, Professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week, students examine apocalyptic issues such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and global warming.
"We analyse why these ideas spread over time," he said, as well as the way in which hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a particular human behavior.
For example, when nuclear material reaches the hands of terrorists, war could break out.
This month, the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they were comparable to real life.
"I have tried to inform the students about what is possible, probably, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of art history and anthropology, formed a team to offer a course with the simple title "The End of the World".
"We do not take up 2012 so that we always keep the option of being able to stop the course again, in case the world does not fall," said Restall.
Despite the "preliminary downfall", the students must study, create projects and participate in final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam is conducted on the eve of the Apocalypse, which is why the students have no other chance than "to continue working until night, where the world supposedly ends," said Restall.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours there were no more places," Restall said about his course for students with a high average who were filled with 35 students.
For weeks before the beginning of the semester, we received e-mails from students who asked if there were still places free.
The students, on the other hand, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It is fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers-Camden for religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect or religious mentality is really just a matter of comfort or lack of it.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa for psychology and nursing explains that he has seen all apocalyptic films.
"I have never heard of a lesson where this is taught," he said.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students asked - and less than a professor - stated to believe in the last date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the prophecy of the Maya, and in certain ways we discredit them," said Julie Zegelen, a student in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
He notes, however, that in Western society there is an apocalyptic fear that brings back centuries when people responded to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased this speculation.
"Somewhere else people don't think so," he says.
This is the case mainly in the English speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who teaches in the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question whether he would know a course there on the "End of the World".
"The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world," he wrote as an indication of an exception to a higher instance.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days were spoken by the last court, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people immediately think of a new date" or philosophically that the 21st December was the beginning of a seven-year period after which the end of the world would come.
Students and professors take this date easily.
Several said that they wanted to go to celebrate about "the end of the world".
"Maybe I'll call some friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communication.
