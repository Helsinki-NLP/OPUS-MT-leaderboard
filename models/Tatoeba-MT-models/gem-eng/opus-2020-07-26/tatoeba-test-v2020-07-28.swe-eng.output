He will fall for the temptation.
The TV doesn't work.
I can explain that.
She behaves like a child.
What does it look like?
Mary thinks she has super powers.
I know all this.
Everyone needs to know.
After the stop, the train quickly accelerated.
What did that mean?
Who do you want to talk to?
No one has asked you to agree, but at least you can accept that there are people who have different opinions than you.
Tom dropped the book.
I'm the best.

Tom and I, we both miss you very much.
Please.
Tell me why she's crying.
It's an old manuscript.
You wouldn't enjoy it.
I'll talk to the principal.
I opened the door.
Tom didn't pretend to hear Mary yelling at his name.
I decided never to do that again.
What did they think?
He dried the sweat off his face.
Wash your face.
When I got home, I discovered that I had lost my wallet.
She never talks bad about other people.
I'm waiting for the store to open.
There's snow on the ground.
You want these things, don't you?
Where was Tom born?
I have everything I wanted.
I feel totally helpless.
You don't love me anymore?
I'll see you later.
The market opens at nine in the morning.
Beer's good.
I appreciate your help.
I was with friends all night last night.
I'm really worried about that.

There was no one left but me.
Now they have three children.
I'm eating an apple.
That's the other one.
We're very happy.
Three of my children died.
It's on your table.
Tom must have hit his head.
Tom was cheating on a nurse while he was in the hospital.
How big will it be?
He acted quickly and put out the fire.
Yes.
Is that what you mean?
I did it three years ago.
Be patient.
Buy me a toothpaste powder when you're in the store.
What a clever idea!
I have another question.
You have to tell Tom.
I didn't know anything.
Here comes Tom now.
If only it was that simple.
I'm awful.
I'm going to study English this afternoon.
There's almost no milk left in the glass.
Tom can't see you.
He's got a big ego.
Life is not permanent.
The man finally confessed to what he had done.
Tom tapped.
I almost got hit by a car.
Tom's very brave.
Shouldn't you be going home?
Australia is not Austria.
Spindles spinning nets.
I don't think that's gonna help.
Tom came to ask us for help.
I'd like to send a recommended letter.
We can all go home.
Tom spent his entire life studying sharks.
You want those pralines?
Who's Sami's father?
Your bike is much newer than mine.
She had forgotten her umbrella, so I borrowed mine.
I was just lucky.
Hold the rope.
I'm still thinking about him.
Here's my receipt.
I'm going to get the car.
I need a week.
My principal at the university was chemistry.
But why?
Tom opened his suitcase.
Come quickly!
I ordered two pizzas online.
Sami and Layla started arguing.
I didn't really understand the name of that designer.
Mary thinks she's smarter than anyone else.
We weren't rowing.
Who do you want to talk to?

Who died?
He likes this guitar.
I almost never go out.
My brother has to write a exam.
How did you like the concert?
At first, it was great.
I see silver, but I don't see gold.
Tom's getting frozen.
I'll try.
Her voice was repeated through the silent house.
We're in Boston.
Get on the radio, please.
She's reading a book.
Do you need anything else?
Don't even talk to me.
You have to pay back your debts.
It's okay with me.
I'm going to work at 7:00.
I'm sorry.
What's so funny?
Did you really see Tom helping Mary?
We bought Mary something.
Can you come closer?
I have a brand.
She bought a new computer.
We cut trees with an axe.
It's scary.
I live in northern Sweden.
When he came back home, the kids already slept.
So where are you going?
By the way, how many of you for a diary?
Disgusting!
Hurry up or we'll be late for lunch.
I had a nice time.
Tom asked if I'd like to cook.
His absence was due to illness.
She was excommunicated.
I didn't ask for this.
Don't you see?
Food!
I need this money.
I've seen this before.
They made him president of the club.
It's not Tom's fault.
It was the window Jack broke last night.
I hope I can do that.
You don't know that.
I'd like to know why.
How long was Tom here?
This is going to be the warmest summer in thirty-six years.
Are you enjoying this?
I'm not the least romantic.
This is Tom's turtle.
I do not think they accept these conditions.
Where were you when I needed your help?
My brother has never ascended to Mt Fuji.
Why didn't you believe me?
It's been a terrible day.
Who were you talking to?
It's going to be colder and snow later today.
Can you help me fix my puncture?
You can't leave me.

What else can we do?
Where do you usually go and cut yourself?
He didn't have to bring an umbrella.
I faxed Tom a map.
I had lunch with Tom.
Tom knows Mary's dog's name.
It doesn't have to be done right now.

None, however.

It doesn't have to mean you're right.
I'm looking for someone to fall in love with.
Tom grabbed his bag.
She's not married.
Their son has autism.
The bus stopped so passengers could get on.
We'll see you again.
Tom hates dancing.
I was just about to go home.
Please wash your hands.
The next artist is amazing.
She'll be late for dinner.
I thought it would be worth it.
Tom's happy.

Nobody else knows what he's talking about.
He wrote it down so he wouldn't forget.
Doors aren't as bad as you think.
I worked as a piano tuner for many years.
Those who don't want to go don't have to.
Did you hear that?
That's what we're waiting for.
Eye for an eye.
Tom's engaged to Mary's little sister.
It's only half the truth.
When did you move to Berlin?
I really like red.
Tom says he's busy.
Why am I the only one they complain about? They only do an example of me and use me as a scapegoat.
What's your plan?
Don't let go of me.
Mary put some flowers in the vase.
Is that what you wanted to say?
Tom seemed lost.
I like it, but I don't love it.
His health is getting worse and worse.
Tom can't be replaced.
This is harder than I thought.
I don't speak Chinese.
She misses him.
My dog is very clean.
We've got it all figured out.
You should come see us!
Bread is baked in an oven.
I like Korean food.
Why didn't you go first?
I'll let you do the talking.
The streets are flooded.
He spoke very loudly.
Were they good?
I'm at the north gate.
You must have mixed me up with someone else.
It's time for me to sleep.
What are we gonna do now?
No, I went out.
You're lucky.
I bet it hurts.
In the dark, all cats are gray.
Tom's not dead.
My books are waiting for me.
Tom's hurt.
I need more help.
I'll take you to dinner.

The Kyli Mbappé is only nineteen years old.
Tom asked me what my second name was.
What's in the box?
Some things you don't even say in jokes.

Why did he do such a thing?
The baguette is French.
He's your friend.
All you have to do is ask.
Sooner or later, you'll regret this.
The cat slept on the table.
They will agree on that point.
Everything got black.
My eyes hurt.
I should have stayed.
I gotta get out of here.
Here, use my pen.

With these grades you cannot go on to university.
Tom's not very busy, is he?
It's huge.

I know all this.
Don't masturbate.
She felt humiliated.
There's nothing wrong with Tom.
Grab hold of it!
We don't like her.
I panicked.
Can I call you guys?
I know the owner.
Do you like walking?
Tom's not getting paid.
It hurts my leg now.
Do you believe this?
Tom thinks I'm right.
The rent is due tomorrow.

I'm a seven-sleeved.
Give me an inch and a second.
Tom's still crying.
You have to do what I say.
Is this working?
Can I get the list?
Everyone said no to Tom.
It's not cheap.
I could eat a horse.
Tom asked me for help.
You should always think before you talk.
Tom's high.
It's a big company.

Who wants to fight?
How come you're asking?
The cat plays in the rain.
He's my brother, not my father.
Tom's got a cure.
Tom can swim much faster than Mary.
I returned to the house.
Shut up!
Get up!
How could you guess?
I saw what Tom did.
Every time she cleans up her room, she's broken up.
Excuse me, can you lower your voice a little?
Why did you come by?
I wish I could paint like that.
I'm sure she won't come and see you.
I don't know if he's going to visit us next Sunday.
It's been a heavy day.

You should be more careful next time.
All day long, my dad was in a bad mood for losing his wallet.
I arrived last night.
If you think it was my fault, you're on the wrong track.
My nose's too big.
I'm glad you're here.
You have to stay.
I'll see him every now and then.
It's obvious, you don't have to explain it.
It's hard to accept.
You're single, aren't you?
I don't feel very happy.
Drive slowly.
Please let me go.
It's not really my problem.
He has a basket full of strawberries.
You know I love you both.
Usually, which forum is used by French people to talk about politics and the like?
