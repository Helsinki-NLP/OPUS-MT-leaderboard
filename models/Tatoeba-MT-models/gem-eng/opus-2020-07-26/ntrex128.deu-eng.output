Members of the National Assembly for Wales fear confusion with the Muppets
In the case of some members of the National Assembly, the proposal to change their title to the 'MWP' (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Welsh Parliament) is a source of disillusionment.
That is why it is planned to change the name of the National Assembly to "Welsh Parliament" (Welsh Parliament).
National Assembly members of all political directions are afraid to become the target of the mockery.
One Labour Party member said that his group was concerned because the name “Twp” and “Pwp” were indignant.
For non-Waliese readers: in Welsh, "twp" stands for "deaf" and "pwp" for "Aa".
A National Assembly member of the Plaid Cymru Party stated that the entire group was "not happy" and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his group was open to change names, but pointed to the great similarity between "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is spoken similar to the letter u in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission (National Assembly Board), which is currently drafting a law on name changes, said: "The final decision on the names of the National Assembly members is, of course, with the members themselves."
The 2017 Government of Wales Act authorised the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the panel published the results of a public hearing on the proposals which provided broad support for the name "Welsh Parliament" for the National Assembly.
With regard to the title of the National Assembly members, the "Welsh Parliament Members" (Welsh Parliament Members) or "WMPs" preferred the largest support at a public hearing.
National Assembly members seem to propose alternative options, but it could be a problem to call for a consensus for the chairman, Elin Jones, who is supposed to present a draft law within weeks.
The Law on Reforms will include further changes to the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules on the disqualification of National Assembly members and the design of the Committee system.
In their debate on the law, members of the National Assembly can finally vote on their names.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on a change in the country name
The voters decide on Sunday whether the name of their country should be changed to "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The referendum was initiated to settle a decade-long dispute with the neighbouring Greece, which has a province with a similar name Macedonia.
Athens has been insisting for a long time that the name of its northern neighbour means that this claim is raised in the Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed its inclusion in the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the change of names, said he would not accept the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in the name of the price to be paid for accession to the EU and to NATO is to be considered.
The bells of St. Martin's silent in the face of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
"The old people with whom I spoke said that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Adams.
'Today there are both no more.'
He said that the bar's disappearance was understandable.
"People's social life looks different today," he said.
"Bars are no longer the living room of the neighborhood where people regularly find themselves."
At the churches he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the church leaders assume and that they will "be back at the beginning sooner or later".
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment houses with condominiums where people live who do not support the remaining refuges.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy condos in these buildings will be whites," he said, "and thus speed up the complete closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these condominiums will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original White Methodist community was removed in the 1930s.
A black congregation that kept its worship nearby became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a large shopping street in Harlem who refused to hire or support blacks.
At a fire in 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when Johnson’s community members planned to rebuild the building, they commissioned the bell game.
Reverend David Johnson, son of father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the bells of the poor.
The expert who rang bells in July used other words: 'A cultural treasure' and 'an irreplaceable historical instrument'.
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first bell game played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who was 18 years ago changed to the bigger bell game in the Riverside Church.
Merriweather said he was not replaced by St. Martin's.
What has been happening in St. Martin's over the past few months is a complicated story with architects and contractors who have been part of the Church's lay leaders and part of the Bishop's Diocese.
In July, the local councillor, consisting of lay leaders, expressed written concerns about the diocese that the diocese would try to pass the costs on to the council, although he had not been involved in the commission of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complain of lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injured in California 13-year-olds diving to Lobster
In California on Saturday, the first day of the Lobster season, a shark officially attacked a 13-year-old boy diving to Lobsters.
The attack took place shortly before 7:00 p.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told the station KSWB TV in San Diego, he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's cries for help and paddled with several others to the boy to help him pull out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought that the boy was happy to have a praiser, but then he realized that the boy was screaming, “I was bitten!
I've been bitten!".
When hammel arrived at the boy's house, he found that his entire collarbone was torn apart.
“I screamed that everyone should get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” he added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in a critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack was not known.
Rescue swimmer Captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had been seen a few weeks before in the area. However, one concluded that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body area.
Officials blocked access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours for security purposes.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plan to move forward on the cosmetics market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's tackles cosmetic departments that are attractive at department stores, with specialized assistants, boats, superdrugs and Debenhams.
As part of a large-scale advance to the 2.8 billion UK pounds of comprehensive cosmetics market in the United Kingdom, which continues to grow while fashion and household goods are going down, the larger cosmetics departments are being tested in eleven branches across the country. If they are successful, they will be expanded to further branches next year.
The investment in cosmetics coincides with the search of supermarkets for possibilities to use other loading areas used previously for televisions, microwaves and household goods.
According to Sainsbury's information, the scope of his cosmetic offer is doubled for the first time to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees get more space and brand areas similar to those in shops like boats.
In addition, the supermarket performs a relaunch of its “Boutique” makeup series, so that most of the products are vegan friendly – an aspect that is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the perfumer Fragrance Shop will be testing two Sainsbury's firm sales points. The first sales point was opened last week in Croydon in southern London, and a second one will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham this year.
Online shopping and the transition to the daily purchase of small food quantities in local grocery stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to get customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, the sales outlets are increasingly looking like department stores, as the supermarket chain is trying to fight against Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has set up a number of habitats sales outlets since the purchase of Argos and Habitats two years ago in hundreds of branches of Argos sales outlets, and this has increased food sales and the profitability of acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to reorganize its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with boats at the beginning of the 2000s, but after an argument over the distribution of revenues from the drug dealer's branches in the supermarkets ended.
The new strategy is followed by Sainsbury's sale of its 281 retail pharmaceutical business to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds of British pounds three years ago.
The company indicated that Lloyds will play a role in the plan insofar as an extended range of luxury skin care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy is added in four branches.
Paul Mills-Hicks, business director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance of our cosmetics departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our brand range is tailored to all needs. Due to the seductive environment and cheap locations, we are now an attractive destination for cosmetics purchases that challenge the previous type of shopping."
Peter Jones "wrathing" after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from a business worth 11 million pounds
“Dragons” Den” star Peter Jones is “wrong” after TV moderator Holly Willoughby withdrew from a business worth 11 million pounds with his lifestyle brand company to focus on their new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not have time for the common homewear and accessories brand Truely.
The business of the two was compared with Gwyneth Paltrows brand Goop.
The "This Morning" hostess, 37, announced her withdrawal from Instagram.
Holly Willoughby enraged “Dragons” Den” star Peter Jones through her very short-term withdrawal from their lucrative lifestyle brand to focus on their own new connecting contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones is supposed to have been "worst" when the "golden girl" of television attended a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, unable to devote enough time to the joint homewear and accessories brand Truly due to their new business – worth up to 1.5 million pounds.
The company was compared with Gwyneth Paltrows brand Goop and would probably have doubled Willoughby's estimated assets of 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her withdrawal from Truly at Instagram, Jones left Britain on the way to one of his holiday homes.
One source said: “Truly had by far the highest priority for Holly.
It should secure its future for them in the long term over the next decades.
Their decision to withdraw was completely surprising for all concerned.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, just before the launch of the market.
At the headquarters in Marlow, a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the “This Morning” moderator, which is one of the most promising stars in the UK, could cost millions due to high investment in products from cushions and candles, to clothing and homewear and possible further delays in the market launch.
In addition, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends for ten years with Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, joined him as chairman in March.
The couples spend the holiday together, and Jones holds a share of 40 percent in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is to become a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as the moderator of ITV 'I'm A Celebrity'.
A Jones-based source said last night: "We are not commenting on his business affairs."
Hard words 'and then we fell in love'
He wondered what criticism he had of the news media for a comment some would consider to be 'not presidential' and for such positive statements about the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said, following a news moderator's voice:
'I gave up nothing.'
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, as the first meeting in Singapore was praised by Trump in June as a major step towards North Korea's denukularization.
However, the denuce-clearing negotiations have been brought to the fore.
Over three months after the Singapore Summit in June, Ri Yong Ho, the top diplomat of North Korea, said on Saturday to leading politicians from around the world at the UN General Assembly that the North did not see a "corresponding reaction" to North Korea's first disarmament measures.
Instead, he noted that the United States had committed sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump proved to be much more optimistic in his rally speech.
"We are very successful with North Korea," he said.
“We were facing a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim showed positive results: End of missile tests, support in the release of hostages and return of the mortal remains of American military personnel.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It is so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this crowded arena, there would be about 200 people standing here," said Trump, pointing out the crowd directly in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes are destroying an island in Indonesia and cost hundreds of lives
After the earthquake of Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were said not to be needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok were displaced, no national emergency has been declared a prerequisite for the mobilisation of international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have made it very clear in many cases that they do not ask for international support, so that is a bit difficult," said Summaries.
While Save the Children make up a team to travel to Palu, it is not sure whether foreign employees can work on site.
Sutopo, spokesman for the Civil Protection Authority, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu as to whether international agencies should participate in the relief measures.
In view of the earthquakes Indonesia is constantly struggling with, the country is still unfortunately poorly prepared for natural forces.
While in Aceh Tsunami shelters were built, they are not an everyday sight on other shores.
The apparently missing warning of Tsunami warnings in Palu has probably contributed to the deaths.
Traveling between Indonesia's numerous islands is already a challenge in the optimal case.
Logistics is becoming even more complicated by natural disasters.
A lazaret ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is on the way to Palu, but will reach the place of the new disaster in at least three days.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of the affected Indonesian infrastructure the core of his election campaign and has spent a great deal of money on roads and railways.
However, the government of Joko, which is pursuing the re-election next year, suffers from financial deficits.
In addition, Joko is under pressure due to continued tensions of confession in Indonesia. Members of the Muslim majority there practice a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were expelled from their homes and apartments, when gangs from Christians and Muslims fought on the streets with Machet, arrow and bow as well as other primitive weapons.
View: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge achieves deep balancing hits against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge rescued Liverpool on Saturday at the London Stamford-Bridge Stadium with a hit in the 89th minute before a Premier League loss against Chelsea.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at 0:1 at a distance of about 27 meters from the gate of Chelsea.
He aimed the ball to the left and then shot him towards the back.
The shot sailed high above the penalty area and operated into the right upper corner of the network.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
“I’ve just tried to get into this position and get to the ball. Players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I’ve just tried to create as much time as possible for me.”, Sturridge said to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and had a contact with the ball. I didn't think too much about it and just took the shot."
Chelsea led through the Belgian Star Eden Hazard in the mid-term with 1:0 after a hit in the 25 minutes.
The blues storm gave a pass with the heel back to Mateo, then turned off near the midfield and sprinted into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic played a fast double pass in the middle field.
He then shot a good steep pass so that Hazard got into the penalty room.
Hazard left the defenders behind and closed the net with a left-hand shot at Liverpools Alisson Becker.
Liverpool plays at the group phase of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3:00 p.m. in the stadium San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea is standing in London at the UEFA Europa League Videoton on Thursday at 3 pm.
The number of deaths of Tsunamis in Indonesia increases to 832
The number of deaths from the earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia has increased to 832, as the Civil Protection Authority announced on Sunday morning.
Many people are supposed to have been trapped in the debris of buildings that had been collapsed by the earthquake of the strength of 7.5th of Friday, which had caused waves up to six meters high, reported Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a public speaker at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was dominated by the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest man, 32, for suspected murder after a woman was stabbed
After the discovery of a female body this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation was initiated.
The 44-year-old was found in Grayson Mews on John Street at 7:55. A 32-year-old was arrested for suspected murder.
The police are asking the residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in an early phase, but I would ask everyone who has stopped near John Street in Birkenhead and seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask all people, especially taxi drivers, who might have taken up something with a Dashcam, to contact us. They may have information that is of the utmost importance for our investigation."
A police officer confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
This afternoon friends who believe to know the woman have arrived at the crime scene to find out where she was found this morning.
The investigation is under way, and the police reported that they are in the process of informing the next members of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get to his apartment, but was informed by the police that no one can enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he learned what had happened.
The residents are now informed that it will take hours for them to enter the building again.
It was heard a police officer told a man that the whole area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears dissolved at the place of the event.
It repeats again and again, 'that is so terrible'.
At 2:00 p.m., there were two police vehicles inside the lock and another vehicle in front of the lock.
Within the lock, several police officers were watching the housing block.
Persons who have information are asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call number 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously under number 0800 555 111 and refer to the record 247 of September 30.
The Cromwell Stadium in front of Parliament is the newest monument to the dispute over the rewriting of history
Their banishment would be poetic justice for his destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious art products reminiscent of the Taliban by his fanatical puritan followers.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick's proposal as "poorness" and "try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's stand picture was aimed at the palace of Westminster.
The picture storm in the English civil wars was neither arranged nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestors Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent depiction of Cromwell is proof of the 19th century opinion and part of the historical writing of a figure that, in the opinion of many, is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith said to the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps at the end of the 19th century more than today, as someone who defended Parliament against outside pressure, in his case of course by the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate presentation is the subject of ongoing history debates.
It is certain that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure that represents one side of this gap.
His services as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering them."
Killer pigs bite Chinese farmers to death
According to local media reports, a farmer in a market in South-West China was attacked and killed by a pig.
The man, to whom only the surname "Yuan" was called, was found dead with a blood-stained artery near a pig stable on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer is preparing to inject pigs in Xining province of Qinghai, China.
According to reports, he arrived on Wednesday with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that a door to a neighboring pig house was open.
He said that in the stable there was a large male pig with blood on the nose.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250-kilogram pig had killed the farmers.
"The legs of my cousin were bloody and mutilated," the cousin, to whom the surname "Wu" was called, was quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Photos of a security camera showed how Yuan entered the market on Thursday at 4:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither Yuan nor his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that pigs had been detained to prevent attacks on other people while the police were collecting evidence at the crime scene.
According to Yuan's family and market authorities, reports of compensation for his death.
Although it is rare for pigs to attack people, such cases are well known.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband at her farm in Massachusetts. The man suffered serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 290-kilor pig caught a Welsh farmer between himself and a tractor until the farmer's wife could hide the animal.
After a farmer was eaten by his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "dissolver".
“They’re just playful.
They like to settle and are very curious... they're not ready to hurt someone.
You only have to treat them with the right level of respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread heavy rains to the southwest of the USA
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens on its way through the colder water on the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring floods causing rainfall in North Mexico and the South West of the USA.
On Sunday at 5:00 p.m. East Coast Time, Rosa showed wind speeds of 136 km/h, equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane, and was 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean a trough begins to form, moving east to the west coast of the United States. If Rosa reaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, high tropical moisture is transported north to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will cause up to 25 centimeters of precipitation in parts of Mexico.
Then, in the coming days, tropical moisture will generate strong rainfall in the south-west by interacting with the approaching trough.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 centimeters of rainfall can cause dangerous floods, floods that drift in the water, and possibly landslides in the desert.
High tropical moisture occasionally leads to precipitation rates from almost 5 to 7.5 centimeters per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona, up to 5 to 10 centimeters of rainfall are expected.
Due to the spread of tropical rainfall, there is the possibility of floods of floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
Faced with the threat of tropical rainfall, walking on foot in the desert is strongly discouraged.
Strong rainfall can cause canyons to become raging currents, and thunderstorms bring local wind buoys as well as wind leading dust.
The approaching trough brings local strong rain in parts of the southern California coast.
It is possible to have a total reduction of more than a centimetre, which can lead to small amounts of debris drifting in the water and to smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall in this region.
The first isolated tropical rain showers reach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning. On Monday evening and Tuesday it rains widely.
On Tuesday strong rain spreads into the Four Corners region and lasts Wednesday.
In October, strong temperature fluctuations throughout the United States are possible as the Arctic is cooled down while the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday there is a good example of drastic temperature differences in the middle of the United States.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of almost 12 oC.
In the next few days, the continuing summer heat tries to develop and expand again.
For a large part of the center and east of the USA, a warm beginning of October is expected with wide spread temperatures of 27 oC from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 oC on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures in the first half of October in the east of the US.
Over 20 million viewers have seen the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
On Thursday, over 20 million viewers saw the captivating statements by the Board of Kavanaugh and the woman, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assaults in the 1980 ’ s.
In the meantime, the political situation continued. On Friday, television stations interrupted their regular program due to a last minute turn: an agreement negotiated by Jeff Flake, Senator from Arizona, that the FBI should conduct a one-week investigation of the allegations.
Ford told the Senate's judicial committee to be 100% sure that Kavanaugh had been drunk at a high school party, pressed her and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement he was 100% sure that this had not happened.
It is likely that more than the 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen have seen the hearing.
The company determined the average number of viewers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network that broadcast the hearing, the figures were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems measuring audience numbers in offices.
In order to put this into perspective: This corresponds to the numbers of spectators in a play-off football game or in the Oscar rental.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News Channel, whose opinion-oriented moderators strongly support the nomination of Kavanaughs, recorded the highest numbers of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers of the full-day hearing.
ABC came second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS reportedly had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
The interest remained strong after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the drama of Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican had published a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed by cameras from CNN and CBS on Friday morning, as protesting him in the elevator on his way to a hearing of the Judicial Committee was severely distressed with words.
He stood for minutes with a reduced view while he was being trained. The scene was broadcast live at CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
"They have power while so many women are powerless," said one woman.
Flake said his office had published a statement and supplemented before the elevator concluded that he would have more to say at the hearing before the committee.
All cable and radio networks sent live hours later, when the Judicial Committee on the Forwarding of the nomination of Kavanaughs should vote to the Senate as a whole.
Flake said, however, that he would do this only on condition that the FBI, like the democratic minority, would demand to investigate the accusations against the candidates in the next week.
Flake was convinced, in part, by discussions with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After an interview with Counts and then various senators Flake made his decision.
Flakes' decision was of great importance because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes without the investigation to confirm Kavanaugh.
President Trump has initiated an FBI investigation into the allegations raised against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using Brexit for political purposes
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of their plans for withdrawal from the European Union of using Britain's future for political purposes and undermining the national interests.
On 29 September 2018, the British Prime Minister Theresa May takes part in the Conservative Party's party in Birmingham.
In an interview with her on the cover page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson exacerbated his attack on her so-called "Chequers Plan" for Brexit by calling a proposal that envisages the reciprocal imposition of tariffs by the UK and the EU as "wholely absurd".
Deadly shots on Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with LSU player's death
The police arrested a suspect in connection with the deadly shots on Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested by Baton Rouge's police for murder.
The authority published video footage of the conflict between Sims and Simpson. According to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
As the CBS partner station WAFB reports, the police secured glasses at the crime scene and said that Simpson's eyeglasses had been found.
After a survey of Simpsons, the police reported that he had faced the fatal shots on Wayde.
The lawyer reports that the deposit was fixed at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coronaner's Office published a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a shooting wound on the neck.
The police thank the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the forensic laboratory of the federal police, the Southern University Police and the citizens of the area for their support in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU-Sport Director Joe Alleva thanked the regional executive authority for "their care and their quest for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98 m tall winger grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne had also played for the LSU basketball.
In the last season he scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach, Will Wade, said that the team was "shaking" about Wayde's death and "stand under shock".
"Before such a thing you're always afraid," said Wade.
The volcano spits ashes on Mexico City.
From the volcano Popocatepetl cast out the southern quarter of the Mexican capital has reached.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity had increased in the crater and within 24 hours 183 emissions of gas and ashes were registered.
The Authority monitored numerous cases of caverns and tremors.
Images in social media showed thin layers of ashes on the windshields of cars in quarters of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists discovered that since September 2017 an earthquake of 7,1 Central Mexiko had rocked, increased activity at the volcano located 72 kilometres southeast of the capital.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Conflicts between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
In Barcelona, six people were arrested on Saturday after clashes between the standby police and pro-independence demonstrators. Thousands participated in other demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the polarising independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro separatists who were held back by the emergency police, they threw eggs and also tossed color powder, creating dark dust clouds in the streets normally populated with tourists.
In the course of the day, there was also a handcuffing with the police, who used their batons to control the fighting.
For several hours, pro-independence groups scandalized 'no forgetfulness, no forgiveness' while opposed unionists calling 'Long live Spain'.
As reported by the local press, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries during the protests.
One year after the referendum of 1 October, which was seen by Madrid as illegal, but by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region is still very tense.
The voters had opted for independence with an overwhelming majority, although the vote was low, since the opponents of the division boycotted the vote most of the time.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to prevent the vote in violent clashes in front of the polls.
Per-independence groups had spent the night outdoors on Friday to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take another way.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated with his wife in the protest of the separatists, said he saw the prospect that Catalonia would gain independence, no longer with hope.
“Last year we have experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they could choose, but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite an important, albeit scarce, victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-independence parties this year had difficulty maintaining the momentum. Many of their best known leaders are either in exile or in prison where they are waiting for their proceedings because of their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded protests in favor of the police on his phone, said that the conflict was shattered by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been investigating since the end of last year, announced his candidacy for the elections to the European Parliament next year.
"As a candidate for the European elections, it is the best way to denounce the degradation of democratic values and repression by the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after the house had been framed by car
Three men at the age of 33, 34, and 39 were arrested after a house in Londonderry had been hit by a car several times.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 after British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building themselves were damaged.
In addition, a crossbow may have been shot on the car.
Menga-Treffer means for Livingston 1:0 win over Rangers
Dolly Mengas first goal for Livingston won the victory.
The rising Livingston FC surprised the rangers and led to the first second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Association.
Dolly Mengas hit turned out to be decisive in that Gary Holt's team could match Hibernian in the second half of the season.
Gerrard's team will remain in the Premiership this season without any further victory and will face the Hearts, which are eight points behind them next Sunday.
Prior to that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europe League.
Livingston can in the meantime increase his winnings series in the division to six games, that is, Chief Coach Holt has not seen any defeat since his takeover of Kenny Miler in the last month.
Livingston misses opportunities for casually playing guests
Holt's team should have been in charge for a long time before the hit, as its directness put the Rangers before the most diverse problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but got slower in front of the gate. Then Alan Lithgow could only shoot far after he had been shot in here to meet Craig Halkett's head shot past the gate.
The hosts were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could hinder the guests in standard situations.
In this way the decisive gate came about.
The Rangers allowed a clear shot, and Livingston offered an opportunity for Declan Gallagher and Robinson to shoot Menga together. This shot the gate with a ball contact from the middle of the penalty room.
In this phase, the Rangers had dominated the ball ownership but could not overcome the defense of the hosts, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly remained largely unpalatable.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos Kelly once forced him to fight.
Scott Pittman was defended by Rangers Gatekeeper Allan McGregor with his feet, and Lithgow dragged the ball out of another standard situation from Livingston.
Flanks repeatedly entered Livingston's penal area and were regularly taken out of the danger area, while two required criminal attacks – one of Halkett against Glenn Middleton and one for hand play – were denied.
"Phoenal" by Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were outstanding without exception and have exceeded expectations in this uptrend again.
Their way of playing and their team has hardly changed since their return to the top teams, but Holt is greatly commended for the way in which he has raised the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall kept on Trab throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As long as they were occasionally under Gerrard, they could not reach this standard.
Their last ball was inadequate – only once could they penetrate the host’s team – and that’s something like a wake call for the rangers who are in the middle of the table.
received Erdogan with mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29) smiling faces and blue skies prevailed, when the Heads of Government of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which should serve to repair relations between NATO allies.
There had been disputes on issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Afterwards, Erdogan traveled to Cologne to open up a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called for security reasons that prevented a 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque. However, many followers found themselves nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurds – also heard. They condemned Erdogan’s policy as well as the decision of the German government to welcome him in the country.
The opposing protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, who is praised by some German Turks as a hero and beautified by others as autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclists die in the event of car collision
In a collision with a car, a cyclist has died in London.
The collision took place at about 10:15 a.m. British summer time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a traffic street in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and the police took care of the man, but he died at the accident site.
Months before the accident another cyclist had died in an accident with a driver's flight on Childers Street, about 1.6 kilometres from the accident on Saturday.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officials worked to identify the man and notify his next relatives.
Road barriers and bypasses for buses are set up, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in unrest
According to Prison Office, six prison officers were injured in unrest in a high-security prison for men.
The unrest broke out on Sunday at 9:30 a.m. British summer time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and continues.
Specialized "Tornado" officials were added to end the unrest involving eight inmates and confined to one wing.
Officials were treated on the spot for minor injuries.
One Prison Service spokesman said: “Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to repair an ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and want to make it clear that the police are being handed over and possibly spend longer behind bars."
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, the prison leader was reported to have been treated by a prison prisoner in the hospital following an attack.
In October last year, emergency officers were called into the prison to deal with serious unrest in which the personnel were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with floods like floods (dirring areas may benefit)
It rarely occurs that tropical depression reaches Arizona, but this is likely to happen at the beginning of next week, when the remains of Hurricane Rosa cross the southwest affected by deserts and bring the risk of floods of floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of floods on Monday and Tuesday from the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, as well as to the southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will approach with rain on Monday evening and move directly across Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix informed in a tweet that “from 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have come close as a tropical storm or tropical depression Phoenix up to 320 kilometers!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 kilometres of the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of rainfall with a single up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the deserted southwest including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 centimeters are likely to be singled up to a total of 10 centimeters.
For those who are not at risk of floods, the rainfall associated with Rosa can be a blessing due to the drought in the region.
Although floods are of great concern, this rain is likely to be useful in part, as there is currently drought in the South West.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, in just over 40 percent of Arizona, at least extreme drought occurs, the second highest category," said weather.com.
First of all, the Hurricane path means that Rosa will meet on land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning Rosa will still have hurricane strength with maximum winds of 136 kilometers per hour and will be located 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. Then the hurricane will move north with 19 kilometers per hour.
In the Pacific, the storm will hit the colder water and weaken.
Therefore, it is expected that Rosa will meet in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening with the strength of a tropical storm.
Precipitation may be severe in parts of Mexico, so there is a significant risk of flooding.
"From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonora Desert, precipitation is expected to be 7.5 to 15 centimeters, with up to 25 centimeters possible," said weather.com.
Then, as a tropical storm, Rosa will cross Mexico in a northerly direction, on the early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, reach the Arizona border and then move up to the late Tuesday evening through Arizona to the south of Utah.
"The main risk is expected in connection with Rosa or her remains of very strong rainfall in Baja California, the northwest of the Sonora Desert and the southwest of the USA, characterized by deserts," the National Hurricane Center informed.
As a result of these rainfalls, life-threatening floods and floods in the desert are expected, as well as in mountainous areas of Erdrutsche.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
After the discovery of a 16-year-old in Somerset, three boys were arrested in their teens and a 20-year-old man under the suspicion of attempted murder.
The teen was found injured on Saturday at 4:00 p.m. in the Excelsior-Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital and his condition is "stable".
According to the Avon and Somerset police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
The officials asked all those who had records of the events on a mobile phone to report.
Mr Trump said that Kavanaugh suffered 'unity, anger' of the Democrats.
"A voice for judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the unscrupulous and unheard-of tactics of the Democrats," said Trump at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that during the entire nomination process Kavanaugh suffered 'unity, anger' of the Democrats.
Kavanaugh announced on Thursday before the Congress and dismissed the accusation raised by Christine Blasey Ford, who had sexually harassed them decades ago when both were teenagers.
Ford also announced her accusation at the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the American people had seen the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh on that day.
"A vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the confirmation of one of the most experienced legal heads of our time, a lawyer with an excellent balance in the service of the general public," he said the crowd of his followers in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the Republican voters' participation in the intermediate elections.
"Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
I don't get started, but I'm actually starting," he said.
"That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere."
Trump argued that the Democrats saw their mission in "restraining and blocking".
The first important procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place in the Senate on Friday at the latest, said a senior GOP leader to CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquakes in Indonesia, numbers of victims are rising
According to the authorities of Saturday, at least 384 people were killed. Many of them were swam away as a result of a severe earthquake and a tsunamis on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi huge waves hit the beaches.
Hundreds of people came together on Friday at a party on the beach of Palu, when at the time of the collapse of darkness up to six meters high waves hit the beach, killing many people and destroying everything that stood their way.
The Tsunami was preceded by an earthquake of 7.5.
"When yesterday the threat arose from the tsunami, people still went on the beach and did not run off immediately, and they fell victim to him," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Indonesian Emergency Protection Agency BNP at a conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, he swam cars, tree trunks and houses with him, he met on land everything," Nugroho said. He added that the tsunami had moved over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before he hit the coast.
Some people were climbing trees on the run from the tsunami and had survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated and accommodated in 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the Civil Protection Authority showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, bent and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday the coastal city was shaken by further aftershocks.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Authority BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) stated in a statement that, during the massive earthquake of Friday, energy was equal to the 200-subject of the nuclear bomb that was launched in Hiroshima during the Second World War.
Due to the location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay, the tsunami could have grown, said the authority.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and stated that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
According to his data, the bodies of some victims were found among the ruins of broken buildings. 540 people were injured, and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and damage along the coast could have been 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Communication with Donggala was completely paralysed by Nugrohos, and there was no information.
According to a statement by the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, and his employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
'This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse', the statement stated.
On Saturday, the authority was often criticized for not having informed that a Tsunami had hit Palu, although the waves came in according to official information at the time of the warning.
In social media published amateur photos show a man on the upper floor of a building who desperately warns the people on the street under him from the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a water wall forces on the shore and swims buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the recordings immediately.
The quake and the tsunami caused a massive power failure that interrupted communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue measures.
According to the authorities, the military has begun to send cargo aircraft with the support of Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuations still need urgent food and other vital goods.
The city airport remains closed until October and has only been reopened for assistance.
On Sunday, a visit of President Joko Widodo was planned to be held at evacuation centers in Palu.
The number of Tsunami sacrifices has increased to more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
The employees of World Vision from Donggala have reached the city of Palu, where the employees in tent accommodation in the courtyard of their office are safe, but in Dosebas's words the scenes of destruction passed.
"They told me they had seen many destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even when the relief groups began to do the hard job of triggering disaster relief, some noted that skilled foreign helpers would be hindered on the journey to Palu.
Under the Indonesian law, financial assistance, deliveries and staff from abroad are only possible if the place of an accident has been declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened so far.
"At the moment it is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says ‘okay, that is a national disaster’, we can accept international support, but so far this status does not apply.”
While the second night since the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday fell over Palu, friends and family members hoped for one of the wonders that shed light on the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a wastewater canal.
On Sunday, rescue forces liberated a woman who had been stuck under debris for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subando, coach of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paraglidings for the Asian games that had ended in Indonesia at the beginning of this month.
Other of the prisoners at the Roa-Roa-Hotel were his students, as Mandagi added.
"As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to bear," he said.
Gendon told us how in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa-Roa-Hotel among the paragliders made the round, WhatsApp news had sent to the contestants from Palu who participated in the beach festival.
His news, however, instead of leading to blue ticks, only led to grey question marks.
"I think this means that the news was not delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while filling a ATM in Newport on the Life
According to a Newport Police Press Release, Newport’s Newport Police Department in Newport on the Friday morning, thieves stole a Brink’s employee from filling up a ATM 26.750 US dollars.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied a ATM in the entertainment complex and wanted to add more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, “a man rang behind Brink’s employee” and stole a bag full of money that was destined for the machines.
According to the press release, Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the crime scene, but the police did not indicate how many people were involved in the incident.
Persons who have information about the identity of the suspects are asked to contact the Newport Police under 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name in Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name – in Ye.
When announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being formally known as Kanye West" (The officially known as Kanye West).
West, 41, has used the nickname Ye for some time and has used it as the title of his eighth album published in June.
The change precedes his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where the release of his new album "Yandhi" is expected.
It is a substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producer, for 'emotional reasons'.
The word is not just a shortcut to his current professional name, but it has a religious significance for West in its own words.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘du’,” said West this year in a conversation about his album with radio moderator Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it is us.
From Kanye, which means “the only one”, only “Ye” – just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, of everything.
The album rather reflects what we are."
He's one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known by the names Puff Daddy, P. Didy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who worked with West in the past, has also written his name with and without dashes and capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO pledged not to use the military against the civilian population
The elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use military force against the civilian population while the 50th anniversary of bloody reprisals against students in his country approaches.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use the military to suppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers fired at a peaceful demonstration on the square and killed 300 people. At that time, left-wing student movements were in the process of establishing themselves in all Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans through monthly grants for students and the opening of other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training led to criminal gangs among young people.
USA should double financial resources for artificial intelligence
In view of China's increased activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its spending on research in this area, says investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who was active in Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow on AI announcements of various areas of the US government, although the US generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: The country intends to become No. 1 in the field of AI innovation by 2030.
"The doubling of the budget for AI research would be a good start given that all other countries are so much further behind the US. We are looking for the next AI breakthrough." said Lee.
The doubling of financial resources could double the chances that the next major AI success would be achieved in the US, Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that defeated the highest-ranking American Othello player. Later, he was the leader of Microsoft Research and President of the Google branch in China.
Lee praised former technology competitions from the US government such as the robotics challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and asked about the time of the next competition, as he wanted to help identify the next visionaries.
After reading words, researchers in the US often have to work hard to obtain state subsidies.
"Not China is taking the leading academics away, but the companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been setting up universities to work at AI in recent years.
According to Read's opinion, a changed US immigration policy could also be conducive to the AI efforts of the US.
"I think that Greencards should be offered automatically in the field of AI-promoted people," he said.
China's State Council presented its plan for the next generation of AI technologies (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan) in July 2017.
According to Lese words, the National Natural Science Foundation of China finances individuals at academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations donating money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
At the beginning of this year, the US Department of Defense set up the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, where partners from industry and science will be involved. In addition, the White House announced the formation of a special committee for artificial intelligence.
DARPA also announced this month's investment of USD 2 billion in the next AI initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) is currently investing more than 100 million U.S. dollars annually in AI research.
In the meantime, US laws on the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence have done nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on a change in the country name
On Sunday the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether the country's name should be changed to "Republic of Northern Macedonia", which would enclose a decade-old dispute with Greece, blocking Macedonia's applications for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour means that this claim is raised in the Greek territory. Greece has therefore introduced a veto against Macedonia’s accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name. However, nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slav majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum. A boycott campaign is in doubt that the vote will reach the 50 percent required for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the ballot was: 'Are you in favour of membership of NATO and the EU by adopting the agreement with Greece?'
Supporters of the change in name, of which Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries resulting from the collapse of Yugoslavia, is worth the price of inclusion in organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, since it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said that they would stick to the outcome so that it is decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission said that there were no reports of irregularities by 13.00.
The vote was, however, only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, with 66 per cent of registered voters voting.
"I am here because of my children to vote, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, an electorate in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko gave their vote in the referendum on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, on the change of the country name, which would open the way for accession to NATO and to the European Union.
Before Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, set up a small stage and presented chairs in front of tents set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the raised head, not through the back door," said Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will result in urgently needed investments for Macedonia, with a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that a large majority will be in favour of this, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," said Zaev after his vote.
In his words, a 'yes' result would be a 'confirmation of our future'.
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum.
Another survey conducted by Macedonian channel Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
70 percent said they would vote with 'yes'.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the vote must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policy since its takeover of power last May.
View: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City maneuvered by the entire Brighton defense to achieve goal
On Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overcame the Brighton defense at the 2:0 win of Manchester City.
Aguero made his hits look ridiculously simple in the 65th minute.
At the beginning of the sequence, the Argentinean attacker received a pass in the middle field.
He raced between three Brighton defense players and then ran into the open field.
Aguero then saw himself surrounded by four green jerseys.
He played around a defender and then overtaken several other defenders on the edge of Brighton's criminal area.
He then shot a pass left to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the penalty room to play the ball back to Aguero, who overcame Mathew Ryan with his right shoe Brighton-Torschüter and shot into the right side of the net.
"Aguero struggles with problems in his feet," said City Manager Pep Guardiola to reporters.
“We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he made a goal at that moment."
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League duel.
This gate fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball on this train far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good steep pass along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few trains to steer Sterling to the long corner.
The Sky-Blues attacker aimed the ball into the net just before he slipped into the net.
City plays in the Champions League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 am in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim versus Hoffenheim.
Scherzer wants to ruin the Rockies game
Since the Nationals have been eliminated from the Playoff competition, there was little reason to force further use.
However, the always powerful joke hopes to stand against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday on the hill, but only if this is relevant to the Rockies, who have a game lead in the NL West in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers, for which playoffs are relevant.
The Rockies scored at least one wild card with a 5:2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but still want to secure their first division title.
“Although we don’t play for anything, we can at least throw because we know the atmosphere in the audience here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level that I would meet this year.
Why should I not want to participate in this competition?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starting player for Sunday, but according to reports, they are inclined to throw jokes in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom this would be the 34th bet as a starting player, practised in Bullpen on Thursday and would throw on Sunday on his normal day of rest.
The Washington Legal Officer has this season a statistics of 18-7, an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 Innings.
Trump stops rallying in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation in relation to the Kavanaugh board chosen by him for the Supreme Court when he spoke about the importance of the Republican electorate's participation in the interim elections.
“Everything we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important choices of our lives.
That's one of the big, big ones – I'm not starting, but I'm actually starting, so I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all means, you see the commonality, the abominableness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go over to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we won't give them."
The Democrats, he said, saw their mission in "restraining and blocking".
"And you see this in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "enraged and mean and horrible and dishonest."
He named the highest-ranking democrat in the Senate's Committee of Justice, Senator Diane Feinstein, which gave rise to noises from the audience.
“Do you remember their answer?
Have you allowed the document to go outside?
Uh, uh, wax.
No, no, I'm waiting for you – that was a really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour doesn't let all opinions go any further.
The party is intolerant to those who say their opinion.
When the Momentum activists in my local party agreed to blame me, this came a little surprising.
Finally, I am the last of a series of Labour Members to be told that they are not welcome – just because we are saying our opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she had strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticised for having a different opinion from Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically on similar issues that Jeremy and former top politicians did not agree on.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said 'to include all meetings and be productive'.
Most of the Friday evening GC sessions in my eight years as a local Labour member were just that.
Today, unfortunately, most of the meetings are not marked by this tone, and the promised 'kinder, more careful' policy has long been forgotten when it has ever started.
It is becoming increasingly clear that divergent views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion will then be judged whether or not it is accepted by the Party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the party leader. Colleagues with whom I previously believed to share similar political views now expected me to take a turn-around and to take positions with which I would otherwise never have agreed – whether it be with regard to national security or the European internal market.
Whenever I speak publicly – and it doesn't matter what I say – a chimphtirade follows in the social media, which calls for my election, appeals to the political centre and says I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And with this experience, I'm not alone.
In fact, I know that I am doing better than some of my colleagues, as the comments that I have made are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues, who face daily a flood of sexual or racist abuses and yet never give in to little.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is the normality of harassment.
Jeremy Corbyn demanded last week that the Labour Party promote a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we no longer allow all opinions to be expressed, and with every motion of censure and any change in the electoral rules, the party becomes narrower.
In the last two years, I have often been advised not to express my opinion so clearly, and I would have no problems.
But I did not go into politics.
Since I was a student 32 years ago, motivated by the neglect of the Thatcher government, because of which my classroom literally broke up in the entire school who joined the Labour Party, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most – as a municipal council and as a cabinet minister.
I have never made a noise out of my political views, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way be unclear about my political positions and areas in which I do not agree with the current leadership.
I would just like to say to the supporters of the Friday request: given that the country is going to take a break for Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
In fact, however, I am not addressing this message to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that I will not refrain from acting in the best interests of all of you in my opinion.

Ayr vs. Melrose 38:17: Unbeated ayr team rises to the top
Two late attempts may have distorted the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr earned the victory in this extremely entertaining game of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They are now the only team of ten unbeated at the top of the table.
In the end, the success of the home team was due to its superior defence as well as to its better chance utilization, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in our games so far, and we're still unbeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie von Melrose said: "Recognition for Ayr, they have taken advantage of their chances better than we have."
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute raised by Frazier Climo led Ayr. However, due to a yellow card for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes who had been released for the game by the Warriors, Melrose was able to make the numbers speak, and Jason Baggot caught a non-enhanced attempt.
Climo expanded the leadership of Ayr with a criminal trial before he scored a hit in the half term and then made an increased attempt on his own, so that at break 17:5 it stood for Ayr.
Melrose, however, began the second half of the season well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was increased by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
Afterwards, there was a longer interruption due to a severe injury by Ruaridh Knott, which was carried by the field. After the continuation, Ayr developed his lead by an attempt by Stafford McDowall increased by Climo.
Then, acting as captain of Ayr, Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and again, at the end of a phase, Melrose had enormous pressure paid the additional man by a non-increased attempt by Bruce Colvine.
The home team came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for Takkling without a ball against Climo, MacPherson scored a touchdown from the prime Ayr package.
Climo raised as almost since the break-up after Kyle Rowe David Armstrong's boxing kick and flank player Gregor Henry had sent off the fifth attempt of the home team.
"Still Game" star seems ready for new careers in the gastronomy
"Still Game" star Ford Kieran seems to be ready for a change to the restaurant industry after it turned out that he was called the managing director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC broadcast, whose screenplay he writes and in which he plays one of the leading roles together with his long-standing Comedy partner Greg Hemfill.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the show, and Kühr seems to plan a life to Craiglang.
According to official registrations, he is Managing Director of Astridmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source of Scottish Sun suggested that Küpp is interested in getting into Glasgow's "happy restaurant business".
"The sea belongs to us": The Bolivian included in the country hopes that a court will open the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol in La Paz in front of the marine headquarters decorated with Tauwerk.
A sea blue flag blows on public buildings.
Fleet bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon carry the motto: “The sea is our legitimate property.
To recover it is a duty."
All over the country, the memory of the coastal section of Chile lost in a bloody 19th-century conflict with resources is as alive as the desire to cross the Pacific.
These hopes may not be as strong as they have been for decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a judgment of the International Court to be passed on 1 October following five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and expects the result of course with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Throughout the country, many Bolivians are being subjected to the IGH's ruling on large screens, hoping that the Hague Court will decide in favour of Bolivia's request. According to this, Chile is obliged after decades of sporadic talks to negotiate a sovereign access of Bolivia to the sea.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who will face a controversial battle for his re-election next year, there is also much at stake in the Monday judgment.
"We are just about to return to the Pacific," he praised at the end of August.
However, some analysts consider it unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia, and believe that this would also change little.
The United Nations Organization, based in the Netherlands, is not empowered to respond to Chilean territory and has determined that it will not decide on the outcome of possible discussions.
Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law, notes that the case was “not complicated”.
Far from supporting the Bolivian case, the last four years could also mean a setback.
"The current Bolivian government has taken care of the issue of access to the sea," said Zárate.
She suggested that Morales' military rhetoric choked any remaining good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue their talks, but after these events this will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the view that the court's decision had been exceptionally quick.
On Monday Bolivia has "an extraordinary opportunity to introduce a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "put an end to the 139-year disputes for mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also argues that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America – uses the topic of the sea as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific", he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to recognise that we must overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament takes place only if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if they can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He called upon the United States to implement the promises made in Singapore during a summit between the rival heads of state.
His remarks come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be facing over three months after the summit with North Korean head of state Kim Jong-un in Singapore shortly before bringing about the determined nuclear diplomacy.
Ri referred to the idea that further sanctions and the US's resistance to a declaration to end the Korean war would ever force the North into its knees, as a "brain spun".
Washington is skeptical and does not want to agree to the statement without Pjongyang taking essential disarmament steps first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pjoongyang is serious about the omission of an arsenal in which the country probably sees the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pjongyang for next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris show the latest collections for huge headgear that will soon be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely shield the sun, you don't have to search anymore.
On the walkway, designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a range of crazy oversized headgear for their summer collection 2019, which fascinated the fashion world at the Paris fashion week.
Extremely impractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations over the walkway.
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was an extravagant beige-coloured hat with a feathered wide edge that squeezed the heads of the models straight.
As other oversized accessories, watermelons, a magic hat and even a pineapple were shown with jewels. However, these are not intended to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a number of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were lined with sewn lips and had more resemblance to Hannibal Lecter than to Haute Couture.
A creation resembled a diving equipment, including snorkels and scuba goggles, while another looked like a melted ostrich.
And if you want to put another huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Fashion observers predict that the huge headgear could find their way into shopping streets near you.
The overdimensional hats follow directly on "La Bomba", the straw hat with 60 centimeters wide edge, which all carry from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat, which struck great waves in the social media, sent another great creation over the walkway: a beach bag made of straw that was almost as large as the model wearing a swim suit that held the bag.
The bass bag in reddish orange with bastfransen and a white leather hook was the outstanding piece of Jacquemus' summer-2019 collection "La Riviera" at the Paris fashion week.
Prominent stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I reckon that big hats and beach bags will be available in the shopping streets for next summer. The designer has so much excitement that the demand for oversized accessories will hardly be ignored."
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
Scotland's independent schools are still distinguished by academic excellence. This has continued in 2018 with further outstanding examination results and is only underpinned by individual and joint successes in the fields of sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to care for their pupils and their parents at the highest possible level.
Independent schools pursue the goal of preparing their pupils for further education and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as a world citizen.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart."
This is an impressive reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build relations and trust with people from other countries.
The current audit results of this year we find that languages with the highest existing rates are at the top of the rankings of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages achieved Note A during the higher examinations.
From the data collected by 74 SCIS member schools, 72 percent of the students in Mandarin achieved Note A during the higher examinations, while 72 percent of the students who learned German, 69 percent of the students who learned French, and 63 percent of the students who learned Spanish also achieved Note A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge that will undoubtedly need children and young people in the future.
Languages are today regarded as optional subjects as STEM subjects (natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and in other places.
According to a survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014, 17 per cent of the reasons that employers mentioned problems in the occupation of vacancies were related to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly required when it comes to preparing young people for their future occupation.
As more and more open jobs require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the profession chosen, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage in the future through such a lifelong ability.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries, multilingual people will automatically give a lead to competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to entertain, and French was spoken as the only language of a two-digit percentage (15 percent).
For this reason, it is important for the children of today that we now invest in language lessons.
Children who speak several languages, in particular languages of developing countries, will have better opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, different languages are taught at all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages will be taught that are considered to be the most important for the United Kingdom in terms of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever your child’s interests lie, independent schools will always be able to choose a number of languages with appropriately specialised teachers.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares the children and equips them with the skills necessary for their success, whatever the future holds.
At this stage, in a global economic environment, it cannot be denied that languages remain of fundamental importance for the future of the country, and that is why this needs to be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be regarded as 'international communication capability'.
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent School.
LeBron before Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see LeBron James enter Los Angeles Lakers for the first time, waiting will end soon.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will be playing against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday's opening game.
How many minutes will he play, however, is not yet clear.
"It will be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will probably only play a few minutes.
At the beginning of this week, James was asked for training according to his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason plan.
"I don't need preseason games in this phase of my career to prepare me," he said.
Time for Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, a series of election campaigns.
This is the first of Trump's five rallies planned for the next week, including in his well-intentioned places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the floating vote on the confirmation of his election for the vacance at the Supreme Court, Trump wishes to build support for the upcoming half-time elections in November, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress.
When will Trump's rally take place in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 19:00 (East Coast Time).
You can track Trump's rally in West Virginia below as live stream at YouTube online.
Trump is likely to address the hearings of the Kavanaugh board nominated for the Supreme Court on allegations of sexual misconduct that were conducted this week in a tense atmosphere. The expected Senate vote on the confirmation remains in silence for up to a week while the FBI is conducting investigations.
However, the main objective of this rally series is to support Republicans who have to make difficult elections in a November.
That is why President Trump's election team told Reuters that these five rallies will serve to 'mobilise volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to preserve and expand their majority in the Senate and in the House of Representatives'.
"The control of the Congress is so important for its plans that the President will travel as many states as possible, while the operational election season approaches," said a Trump election speaker who did not want to call his name to Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, "Ohio and Pennsylvania will participate and report media from Pittsburgh" at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling for tonight.
The visit to Saturday is Trump's second visit this month to West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump tries to support the republican Senate candidates from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, in polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come to try to boost him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The US team shows willingness to fight in order to maintain the hope for individuals on Sunday
After three one-sided rounds, the four-parts might have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed on Saturday afternoon.
As a sports concept, the swinging pendulum is a pure invention, but one that players really believe in, and especially in competitions like this one.
So where is the moment of their opinion now?
"They were in charge with six points, and now there are four, so I think that means a small moment for us," said Jordan Spieth when leaving the venue.
Of course, Europe is in the advantage and is four points ahead, while twelve others follow.
According to Spieth, however, the Americans feel some wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and can show three out of four points each.
Spieth was incredibly strong from drop to green and goes on with a good example.
The guttural enthusiasm became louder in the course of his round when he sunk an important putt to decide the fourth match with four points for both of them, after he and Thomas had dropped two holes with two points.
His coup, which decided the match for her on the 15th hole, triggered a similar scream, which suggests that the American team is not yet out of play.
"I really have to get in and take care of my own game," Spieth said.
That's all that remains for the individual players.
18 holes to set a character.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days as their only player, no doubt writing the history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's unequal, but sympathetic duo is four out of four points and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was not the only couple who had not beaten Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they had also avoided Bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and at the back nine holes on Friday morning.
This series and the seemingly between them and the depleted amount of flowing energy underpinned that they are the players who have to beat it on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players who seal a possible European victory when the sun falls over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
To speak of European fame would, however, be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short trial with Sergio Garcia, the four-person hero of the morning who played together with Alex Noren.
A bowey and two doubles on the front nine holes brought the Spanish and the Swedish to a clamp which they could not almost overcome.
On Sunday, however, no one can help them out of the clamp.
The four- and four-compartments are so intriguingly looking at the way a strategy can change quickly because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give or don't give.
The Europeans have so far played better as a team and are clearly in charge the last day. However, this round of four has also shown that the US team is ready to fight, which some, especially in the USA, had doubted.
Europe will take the lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup with 10:6
After fours and fours from Saturday to the USA, Europe is ahead with 10:6 and goes with a solid lead in the last day of the Ryder Cup.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went ahead with two victories over the hard-hitting Tiger Woods and was able to score four points in Le Golf National.
The European team led by Thomas Bjørn, who wanted to recover the trophy lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated the four in the morning against the failing American team and won the series with 3:1.
In the four-parts the U.S. resisted more and won two matches, but was unable to pick up the remainder.
Jim Furyks team needed eight points in the twelve played on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood won four points in a row as the first European newcomer, while he and Molinari, baptized after a sensational weekend 'Molliwood', won four points as the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup in their four opening matches.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they harmoniously harmonised and beat the enchanted Woods and the American novice Bryson Dechambeau with an even more powerful 5/4.
Woods, who had dragged through two matches on Saturday, had his brilliance flashed occasionally, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fours and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested in the morning during the four o'clock, returned and played as a partner of Henrik Stenson the four games. They won 2/1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and three of the world.
For Europe, however, not everything ran according to their ideas on this pleasant windy day south-west of Paris.
The triple major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the bar for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
In the four, they won a tough 2–1 win over the Spanish-playing Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the four-parts 4/3 after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup it has only happened twice that a team came back after it had gone into the individual with a minimum of four points. However, as the title holder for Furyk’s team is enough to keep the trophy undecided.
After being second only in second place for two days, it does not look as if they could start a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects unilateral disarmament with no confidence all the way out
On Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations that continued sanctions would deepen its mistrust of the United States and under these circumstances would by no means unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organisation's annual General Assembly that last year, North Korea 'has taken substantial action in good will'. For example, it stopped nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear test site and undertook not to multiply nuclear weapons and technologies.
"However, we do not see a corresponding response from the United States," he said.
'Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances we will never disarm ourselves unilaterally first.'
While Ri confided in North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a 'phase-wise' approach to denukularization, in which North Korea was rewarded for successive steps, his statement appeared to be repeated significantly in so far as it did not reject unilateral denuklarization from the outset, as Pjongyang had done in the past.
Ri pointed to a joint declaration by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a President-in-Office of the United States and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June. Kim had assured him that he was working on the "denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea strives for an official end to the Korean war led from 1950 to 1953, while the United States said that Pjongyang had to give up his nuclear weapons first.
Washington also resists demands for a relaxation of the severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on "first denuklarization" and increases pressure through sanctions to reach its goal by coercion, and even against "the explanation of the end of the war," said Ri.
“The assumption that sanctions can force us to kneel is a brain spasm of people who know nothing about us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not agree with plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. head of state had highlighted at the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and the South Korean head of state Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If South Korea were the other party on the denukularization issue instead of the US, it would not have come to this standstill in the denukularisation of the Korean peninsula."
However, the sound of Ris Rede differed enormously from his speech last year when he said to the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target North Korea's missiles on the mainland of the United States, after "the evil President" Trump Kim had referred to as "the missile man" as a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who last year threatened with the "total destruction" of North Korea, praised Kim to the United Nations for his courage in the face of disarmament steps, but he said that there was still much work to be done and that the sanctions had to remain in force until the de-cultification of North Korea.
On Wednesday Trump said he had no time frame for this: "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months – don't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: 'The enforcement of the Security Council's sanctions must definitely continue vigorously until we have achieved the complete, final and verified denukularisation.'
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to finance the drying out of Pjongyng's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the margins of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pjongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In July, when he left Pjongyang, he said that progress had been made to be accused of North Korea only hours later, he had made "walking-like demands".
North Korea praised this month at a meeting with Moon to reduce a missile base and a nuclear complex when the United States took "corresponding measures".
He said that Kim had told him that the 'corresponding measures' aimed at were security guarantees given by Trump in Singapore, as well as steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn in a course to sleep enough
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all students get more sleep in basic education this year. This is an action against the spreading macho culture, keeping themselves awake with caffeine and learning all night long.
One scientist has found that students at the world's leading university are often unneeded when it comes to paying attention.
The course was conceived by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital and is in his opinion the first such course in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why am I only experiencing this now, in my last year?’
After her words, no one had ever told her how important sleep is. That surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
This year's first course explained how the basics of good sleep habits contribute to academic and sporting performance and also improve general well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of Health Services at the University, said that the university had opted for the introduction of the course after she had found that students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In a section the students see the picture of a room in a living room and click on coffee cups, curtains, training shoes and books. They receive information about the effect of caffeine and light as well as the effects of lack of sleep on the sporty performance and the importance of a sleeping routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleep withdrawal can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes and cancer.
They are then encouraged to think about their daily routine using an interactive map of the university site.
“We know that it will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know this – just as you have the right to know how the decision to smoke affects your health," added Professor Czeisler.
The pride of pushing a "night shift" was still widespread, he said and added that modern technologies and the ever-increasing pressure on students made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
Sufficiently good sleep, the "secret weapon" of all students should be against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said. Furthermore, weight gain was avoided, as sleep deprivation put the brain in starvation mode so that they were constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course. He had won one of his courses last year in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to press on to a university-wide course.
He hopes that in the next step, all postgraduate students will be invited to undertake a similar study programme before taking up their studies at the competitive university.
According to Professor Czeisler's recommendation, the students should set themselves an alarm clock for sleep time and awakening time and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light", which results from electronic screens and LED lighting and can cause the circadian rhythm from the clock. This leads to problems during sleep.
Livingston vs. Rangers 1:0: Menga-Tor forces Gerrard's player
The Rangers lost another away game, when Dolly Menga's hit for Steven Gerrard's single-playing team meant a 0:1 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to book their first away victory since the 4:1-triumph with St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team added Gerrard's second defeat to 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind the leading hearts in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga met seven minutes before the half-life, and the Inspired Rangers seemed to have no chance of compensating.
While the Rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingston rises to the third place and is only behind Hibernian at the goal difference.
The Rangers are also in danger of further trouble after the line judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound by an object apparently thrown out of the guest block.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that took over Ayr and reached the semifinal of Betfred Cup.
Gett, on the other hand, stayed with the same eleven Livingston players who took off the Hearts one point last week, and would have to be enthusiastic about how his well-trained team held their opponents on step and step under pressure.
The Rangers dominated the ball possession, but Livingston reached more when they had the ball.
They should have scored a goal after only two minutes when Mengas first gave Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal. However, the midfielder missed his chance and shot next to it.
Then a long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow was only able to shoot by the back door.
The Rangers took control, but their game in the last third seemed rather hopeful than convincing.
Alfredo Morelos was obviously of the opinion that after a quarter of an hour of a conflict between him and Steven Lawless, he should have been convicted, but arbitrator Steven Thomson did not allow the complaints of the Colombian.
In the first half of the season, the Rangers only scored two goal shots, but the former Ibrox Gatekeeper Liam Kelly had little difficulty with Lassana Coulibaly's headball and a tame shot by Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's hits in the 34th minute may not have matched the game, it is not to be denied that they had earned him for their hard work alone.
Once again, the rangers couldn't deal with a ball shot by Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher chose the ball to Scott Robinson shot, which kept the rest and Menga for a simple graduation.
Gerrard acted half-time and replaced Coulibaly against Ryan Kent. The change showed almost immediate effect when the winger put Morelos in position, but the impressive Kelly rushed off his line to block the ball.
Livingston, however, continued to lead the guests to play exactly the game they are playing, where Lithgow and Halkett received a long ball after another.
Holt's team could have expanded their leadership in the last phase, but McGregor stood well and defended Jacobs before Lithgow put a head ball out of the corner.
The Rangers exchange player Glenn Middleton also demanded a late hit after a crowd with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanach: Inventor of the violin counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanach: On September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as violin counter.
Since then, the violin counter has become a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with apparently unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to search for radioactive minerals like uranium.
If you set these headphones, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: "Actually, I hear a cracker!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention that bears its name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see degenerate cells"
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" and destroy degenerate cells.
The vaccine helps the immune system to detect degenerate cells in the course of treatment.
The method removes immune cells from a patient that are altered in the laboratory.
These cells can "see" a lot of cancerous common protein and are then re-injected.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancers.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognise degenerate cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method removes immune cells from a patient that are altered in the laboratory so that they can "see" the many cancers common protein HER2. Then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute of Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of various types of cancer", including breast, ovary, lung and intestinal cancer, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method in which patients are removed from immune cells and taught to attack cancer cells has helped to treat a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West released a Pro-Trump-Tirade after his appearance at SNL and carried a MAGA-Kuppe ("Make America Great Again").
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was based at Saturday Night Live in the studio after he praised US President Donald Trump for a long time and said he wanted to take office as a presidential candidate in 2020.
After singing his third title of the evening, "Ghost Town", and wearing a Make America-Great-Again cape, he continued with a chimpanonade against the Democrats and again stressed his support for Trump.
“I’m often asked by whites, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s a racist.’
So if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate's judicial committee on the accusations of sexual harassment raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the recording of West Schimpftirade was not sent, it was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock to social media.
It's not clear if Rock wanted to make fun of the publication about West.
West also complained to the audience that he had difficulties behind the stage because of his headcovering.
“They harassed me behind the stage.
They said, "Don't go out with the cap."
They harassed me!
And then they say I was in a submerged area," he said according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see the sunken area?” He said, “He’s going to put on my supermancape, because that means you can’t tell me what to do. You want the world to go ahead?
Try it with love."
His comments caused at least twice the audience to call, and SNL employees were embarrassingly touched, said Variety. One person said the magazine: "It was dead still in the studio."
West had been late as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, the rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days before.
West many confused with a lecture on the title "I Love it", in which he was disguised as a perrier bottle.
West received the support of Candace Turner, head of the conservative group TPUSA. She tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: DANKE, THAT YOU ARE REPRESENTED TO THE MASSE."
Talkshow moderator Karen Hunter twittered that West was just himself and that was absolutely wonderful.
“But I don’t want to reward someone who, in my opinion, owns and gives of himself a harmful ideology for my community (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his ‘art’).
He's free.
The same is true for us.", she added.
Before the broadcast, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and was now "The Being Formally Known as Kanye West" (officially known as Kanye West).
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper friend Snoop Dogg bore the name Snoop Lion, and of course Prince, the late music legend, changed his name into a symbol and then in "The Artist Formerly Know As Prince" (The formerly known as Prince artist).

"Game of Thrones" Star Kit Harington attacked toxic manhood
Kit Harington is known for his role as sword swinging Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series "Game of Thrones".
The 31-year-old actor, however, attacked the macho hero’s stereotype. He said that such roles on the screen would result in boys often having the feeling of having to be strong to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Harington said that he believed something had gone wrong and asked how to solve the problem of toxic manhood in the #MeToo age.
Harington, who recently married Rose Leslie, who also played a part in the "Game of Thrones", also 31 years ago, admitted that the solution to the problem was "very important".
"I personally at present consider the question of what has been wrong with manhood," he said.
"What did we teach grown-up men about the problem we are now observing?"
Harington believes that television is perhaps partly responsible for increasing toxic masculineity due to the very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is born, and what has been learned?
What is taught on television and on the street that gives the boy the feeling of having to embody this particular side of a man?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time: how do we change this?
For with the young men something has clearly gone wrong."
In addition, he admitted in the interview that after the end of the series he would not participate in Prequels or Sequels of "Game of Thrones". He had "ample of battlefields and horses".
From November on, Harington will be seen in a new edition of Sam Shepard's "True West", the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently told him that the best thing for him was "Game of Thrones" was that he met his wife Rose.
"I met my wife at this show, so I have been able to keep my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose Leslie played in the numerous Emmys fantasy series Ygrette, the lover of Harington's character Jon Snow.
The two married in June 2018 on Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In contrast to the past, the majority of the new cases were transmitted through sex.
Up to now, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way was almost zero, reported by Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan Province.
In comparison, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 in China.
In China’s LGBT community, sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against members of the LGBT community should be widespread.
Based on the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men ultimately marry women.
Many of the transmissions of disease are due to inadequate protection in sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised, among other things, general access to HIV medicines to address the problem.
Maxine Waters argues that employees had the data of the GOP-senators leaked, criticises "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Maxine Waters, U.S. House representative, protests on Saturday that a member of her staff has published the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the Wikipedia pages of the MPs.
The Democrat from Los Angeles believed that the claims of "ultra-right" experts and websites would be spread.
"Lies, lies and even more horrible lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The published information should include the private addresses and telephone numbers of the US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday. They were published during the hearing of a Senate committee on the allegations of sexual misconduct by an unknown person in the government district against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The publication took place after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Poundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the contributions is assigned to Waters’ office and published the information of a member of Waters’ staff, reported The Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false accusations – was not in any way responsible for passing this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie."
Waters’ explanation quickly triggered criticism online, including that of Ari Fleischer, a former White House press spokesperson.
"This dementi is angry," wrote Fleischer.
“This suggests that she does not have the right temperament to be a congressman.
Those who are accused of something they have not done must not be angry.
They must not be defiant.
They must not question the motives of the plaintiff.
You must be quiet and quiet."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction with the criticism of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of having acted too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who takes part in the mid-term elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great thing, if that's true," he tweeted.
Waters said in her statement that her office had informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they are held accountable for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all my staff".
Criticism to "Johnny English – You live only three times" – weak espionage parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for Brexit references in every new film that has been painted in the British language. This also seems to be true for the revival of the “Johnny English” campaign franchise, which began in 2003 with “Johnny English – The Spion who published it” and was starved again in 2011 with “Johnny English – Now Right”.
Will an ironic self-paradise on the issue, how obviously we are stupid, become a new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the license of the glotzäugigen, Grimassen cutting and incompetent Johnny English was extended for the second time for mutilation. His name signals more than anything else that it is a general comical creation for cinema visitors in non-English speaking space.
Of course, he is once again the clumsy secret agent who, bizarrely speaking, thinks himself cool and worldly, while in reality he has contributed to the opening of the 2012 Olympic Games in London a single note of the title melody of "The Hour of the Winner".
In addition, the figure was originally based on the chaos behind travellers and international secret agents who played the Atkinson in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials.
The last adventure of Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked the way Johnny English approached a helicopter in a medieval armor, and the rotor blades tied to his helmet.
Atkinson's gift of physical comics is on the rise, but the humor seems rather weak and strangely superfluous, especially because the "serious" series such as "007" and "Mission Imposible" now offer self-confident comedian elements.
The humor seems to be more focused on children than on adults, and for me Johnny English's crazy mischief is not as imaginative and focused as Atkinson's silent filmgags in the role of Bean.
The eternally current premise is that Britain is in great danger.
A cyber hacker infiltrated the super-secret British spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents in use, very much to the failure of the serving agent, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, an inflated and distressed figure, who is already standing before the complete collapse due to their political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this quasi-teresa-may character, but the script doesn't give much with which she can work.
Their secret service consultants inform them that all active spies have been detained and therefore they need to get someone out of retirement.
This also includes Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher at a chic facility, but there are unofficial lessons in the work as an undercover agent. There are a few Gags, as English offers a spy academy reminiscent of 'school of rock'.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and is reunited with his former hard-tested buddy Bough, who is replayed by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a nervous woman of the higher society, whose role Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who in the secret service of your Majesty always make everything terrible wrong, are back in action. They encounter Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is in danger of a charismatic tech billionaire, the dark Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve UK computer problems.
English and Bough start their Odyssee of the grotesque jokes: Dressed up as waiters, they put a chic French restaurant in fire, they provide chaos as they smuggle on board Volta's luxury yacht, and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house with the help of a virtual reality headset.
In this last sequence all the registers are drawn, but as sympathetic and funny as it is, the subject is already dealt with in detail in children's television.
Fairly moderate.
As with the other Johnny-English films, I had to ask myself: ‘Can’t the British film industry Rowan Atkinson play a role that really satisfies his talent?’
Labour denies working on a plan according to which the British work four days a week, but should be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is to consider a radical plan that provides for the British to work four days a week, but is paid for five days.
According to reports, the party intends to disclose to employees the savings achieved by the AI revolution (artificial intelligence) in the form of an additional free day.
This would have given employees a three-day weekend, but would nevertheless receive the same payment.
According to sources, the idea of the party's economic agenda and its plans to shift the balance in the country to the benefit of workers is 'fit'.
The transition to a four-day week was endorsed by the Trades Union Congress (Trades Union Congress) as an opportunity for workers to take advantage of the benefits of the changing economy.
A high - ranking Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: “Before the end of the year, a policy check is expected to be announced.
"A change will not take place overnight, but a working week of four days is an endeavour consistent with the party's approach to restoring the economic balance of workers and the general industrial policy strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support such an idea. The Green Party already promised the launch of a 4-day week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the overall approach is not supported by the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesperson said: "In a 4-day week it is not a party policy and it is not considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell put into practice at the Labour Conference last week his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of anonymous directors and professionals in public utilities.
The shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of the water supply companies may not retain their entire share, as a Labour government could do "deductions" due to alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed the corresponding plans to recruit employees in the boards of companies and to set up inclusive ownership funds to transfer 10% of the equity of private companies to employees, paying annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy express themselves in the news magazine '60 Minutes', whether the investigation by the FBI in the case of Kavanaugh could change their opinion
The FBI investigation of the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his appointment as Judge at the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question as to whether the results of the Republican Senators could influence the government's results in order to win its support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60-minute correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could show anything that could ultimately change their mind.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“I announced in the trial that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after that, said this statement, and asked if he did it.
He was determined, determined and unmistakable."
Graham's voice, however, seems to have been carved in stone.
"My opinion is clear on Brett Kavanaugh, and it would have to burst a bomb," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: Brett has fought this vehemently," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she called could not confirm it."
It's now 36 years old.
And I can't make any changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has been helped to reduce poverty within the framework of this festival?
On this Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will take place in New York, an annual music festival with an impressive line-up to stars and an equally impressive mission – to combat poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands will attend the Global Citizen Festival, which will take place this year for the seventh time, not only to experience the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the actual goal of the event: combating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which took place for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. As part of this project, an international interest group tries to fight poverty by motivating more and more people to participate actively in the fight against poverty.
In order to obtain a free ticket for the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you need to do a number of tasks. These include actions such as volunteering, communication with a leading politician worldwide (by e-mail or telephone) or similar measures to raise awareness of the goal of fighting poverty.
How successful is the project, considering that Global Citizen will remain 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is it the idea to put a cool free concert in perspective, a useful way to convince others that it is time to act, or just another case of so-called clicktivism – if you think you can change something by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen reported that since 2011, the project has been able to record more than 19 million actions from its supporters and achieve different goals.
These actions should have helped to encourage leading politicians around the world to announce commitments and strategies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, at least USD 10 billion of which have already been paid out or contracted by fundraising.
According to group estimates, the funds secured to date have a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important obligations are the project The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and implementers based in the United Kingdom who have committed themselves to support children in their optimal development, and who have promised to help Rwanda with USD 35 million to fight malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the United Kingdom Government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," the Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, announced to the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also announced that, after more than 5,000 actions involving the UK were called upon to improve the nutritional situation of mothers and children, the government announced the financing of the The Power of Nutrition project, which aims to reach 5 million women and children and provides food interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, namely the question, what are the reasons why Global Citizens can fight extreme poverty,
they replied: “It will be a long and strenuous path with heights and depths.
But like the big civil rights and anti-apartheid movements in front of us, we will have success, as we are stronger and more influential together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who perform at this year's event in New York. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman are also presenters.
The US could use the Navy for blockade purposes to hinder Russian energy exports – Ministry of the Interior
According to Washington Examine, Washington can rely on the Navy if necessary to ensure that energy from Russia does not reach the markets including the Middle East, the US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke announced.
Zinc claimed that Russia’s use in Syria is an excuse to explore new energy markets. Russia is currently active at the invitation of the legitimate government in these areas.
"I think the real reason for Russia's deployment in the Middle East is the negotiation of new energy markets, just like in Eastern Europe," he allegedly said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to do so.
"The United States, together with the Navy, can ensure that the sea roads remain open and, if necessary, block them so as to ensure that the energy from Russia does not reach the market," he announced.
Zinc turned to the participants in the event of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that understands itself as the "stim of electricity consumers" in the USA.
He drew a comparison between Washington's approaches in dealing with Russia and Iran and noted that they are practically identical.
"The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia," he said, calling Russia "One Trick Pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The declarations were made when the government was under Trump to extend the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe and to replace Russia, the much more cost-effective option for consumers in Europe.
To this end, government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump Berlin, has become a "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline worth 11 billion US dollars, which is intended to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's massive resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we all believe that energy should not be used as a means of exerting pressure and that consumers can choose suppliers themselves," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The US has received counterwind from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the German Federation of German Industry (BDI), has called on the US to stand out from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," says the Board of Directors of the BDI Dieter Kampf after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to "examine" a presidential candidate for 2020, says the Senator for Massachusetts
The Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would "examine" a presidential candidate after the mid-term elections.
During a Town Hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she is considering a candidacy.
According to The Hill, Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
Mr Warren is planning to examine a presidential candidate 'in detail' after 6 November.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump is directing this country in the wrong direction.
"I am extremely concerned about Donald Trump's handling of our democracy," she said.
In their criticism of Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, Warren has not taken a note.
In a tweet on Friday, she announced that prior to the vote, an FBI investigation is of course required.
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren voters do not believe that they should run for 2020.
According to the survey conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe, 58 percent of potential voters in Massachusetts said that the Senator should not run.
32 percent of voters supported such a candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, 38 percent in favour of a potential candidate, and 48 percent in favour.
Other names include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
According to Associated Press, Biden announced that he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin says on Donald Trump-Ralley about post-traumatic stress disorder under the track Palin
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he's going through when he gets back, he's going to be able to imitate other families who feel the effects of PTBS and some of the wounds our soldiers are coming back with," she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "Elephant in space" and said about her son and other veterans of war that they were coming back, that they were being broken down, that they were coming back and wondering if there was this respect for what other soldiers and pilots and any other member of the military had given the country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, says Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and D.C. support an appeal for a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support an appeal to the new US policy refusing asylum to victims of gang activities or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and districts filed a hearing on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who is questioning politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace-versus-sessions complaint filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August was not announced.
She announced that her partner "and his violent gang boys" abused them, but U.S. officials rejected their asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The attorneys supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people are applying for asylum in the United States, as nations struggling with great problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy raised a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals from 2014 which allowed illegal immigrants to apply for asylum on the run from domestic violence.
The Federal Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "has ignored decades of legislation at state, state and international level".
"The Federal Act requires that all applications for asylum be assessed on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application, and that court violates this principle," was stated in the CFI's statement.
Furthermore, the lawyers argued in the statement that the policy, which immigrants refuse access to the country, has an adverse impact on the economy in the US, since immigrants could be more active than entrepreneurs and could provide the necessary workers.
In June, Federal Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to flee from domestic violence and the violence of criminal gangs to give no more asylum.
"Asyl exists for all those who leave their home country because they are persecuted or because of fear because of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political conviction," said Sessions in his announcement of the policy of 11 June.
It was never the plan by granting asylum to alleviate all the problems, even all the serious problems people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu, as the number of deaths in the race doubles with time
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly worse.
"It's all very tense," says the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her small fevering son in a rescue center in the destroyed downtown of Palu.
“Every minute a new ambulance comes with dead people.
Clean drinking water is scarce."
Residents returned to their destroyed houses to gather their plentiful wealth and to store everything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the staff of the hospitals damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake were completely overburdened.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had vertebral fractures and a broken shoulder, remained outside Palu's military hospital, where patients were treated outside because of the continuing severe aftershocks.
With tears in his eyes, he told how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“Everything went way too fast.
I think I was trapped under the invaded walls," he reported the Associated Press, adding that the reason for staying in the city was a wedding.
“I heard my wife’s cries for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to my wife and my child.
I can only hope they're in a safe place."
U.S. ambassadors accuse China of tyranny with 'propaganda ads'
One week after an official Chinese newspaper sent a four-page announcement in an American daily newspaper announcing the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing’s capital city of exploiting the American press for propaganda purposes.
USA Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the paid supplement of China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the best-selling magazine in Iowa after accusing China of interfering in the US Congress elections on November 6th, an accusation that China contests.
Trump's allegations that Beijing has attempted to interfere in US elections are in line with the announcement of US officials to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign triggered by Washington to exert pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to make advertisements for the promotion of the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an exacerbated trade war, with customs duties on imports for both countries.
Chinese retaliation duties at the beginning of the trade war were to meet exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador in China and former long-standing governor of Iowa, who exports large quantities of agricultural products to China, reported that Beijing has harmed workers, owners of agricultural holdings and companies.
China, according to Branstad in a statement in Des Moines Register of Sunday, now doubles this tyranny by posting propaganda ads in its own free press in the USA.
"With the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government claims that America's proven tradition of free expression and independent press, by switching paid advertising on the Des Moines register," Branstad wrote.
"By contrast, you will find only a limited number of votes against in the newspapers here in Beijing and will not find any real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese could have about China's disturbing economic development, given that the media are firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that one of China's most famous newspapers did not accept the offer to publish his article, but he did not mention the name of the newspaper.
Republicans disperse voters before the interim elections with the debacle around Kavanaugh, warn observers
Since many of the most influential Republicans support and defend the candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in view of several allegations of sexual violence, observers have warned against a counter-reaction during the forthcoming interim elections, which could in particular result from women.
The mood in this regard was extremely tense, and most Republicans have already stated that they are continuing to vote.
"Such things cannot be undone," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said that he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute advance (R-Arizona) was sufficient for an FBI investigation to appease angry voters.
"Don't forget what happened yesterday, they won't forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, first consultant and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to the daily paper in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators in the hall area of the Senate “November is coming,” when the Republicans who control the Justice Committee decided to hold onto the nomination of Kavanaughs, and despite the statement by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation were an extremely important topic, said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political observer of the news page.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially for voters in the suburbs and in younger voters, people between 18 and 29, who, although they don't like the president, often don't choose."
Even before Ford's public statement that its allegations of sexual assault against the candidates of the Supreme Court are detailed, observers indicated that a counter-reaction could result if the Republicans advance the confirmation.
"This situation is a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, NBC News.
"It is not just about the vote of the panel, the final vote or the review of Kavanaughs; it is also about the way the Republicans have dealt with it and how they have dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that supports the election of Democrats, to inform the news channel.
The Americans, however, seem to disagree with whom they should believe due to Ford and Kavanaugh's statements, with a slightly greater share on the side of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov showed that 41% of respondents were definitely or probably convinced of Ford's statement, while 35% stated that they definitely or probably Kavanaugh believed.
Moreover, 38% indicated that they believe that Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lying in his statement, while 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least another plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford made an oath-making statement last week before the Senate Judicial Committee that she was attacked by the drunken Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court had exposed her genitals to her when she was at a party during her studies in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to prevent Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is currently launching a launch on the market with the aim of establishing a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open-source Solid platform of Berners-Lee.
With Solid, users can select where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee suggested that the intent behind inrupt was the "world domination".
"We need to get active now," he said on startup.
'It is a historic moment.'
The app uses Solid's technology to allow users to create their own personal online data storage or a POD.
It can include contact lists, to-dos lists, calendars, music library and other private and corporate tools.
Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all content is available in one browser and at the same time.
The special thing about the personal online data storage is that the user can decide alone who can access which data.
The company describes this concept as personal strengthening and development of data.
According to the CEO of John Bruce, the idea behind inrupt is that the company uses resources, processes and corresponding capabilities so that solid is available to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers who have been appointed to work on this project, as well as a community of voluntary programmers. Furthermore, a security platform purchased by IBM is used.
At the beginning of this week, technology developers worldwide can create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the inrupt website.
Berners-Lee announced that he and his team will not exchange with Facebook and Google about whether a comprehensive change is to be made in which their entire business models will be completely redesigned overnight.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In a post on medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt has the task of providing commercial energy generation and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new, solid-based web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee redesigned the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been a major player in the debate on grid neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very confident about this new era of the Web," he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, wearer of the Viktoria Cross during World War I, was honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England, who was awarded the Viktoria Cross during World War I, was honoured in his hometown 100 years later.
Colonel and priest Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 due to his engagement in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper and never learned that he had won the highest British War Award.
His two grandchildren revealed a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Sunday.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said that this act was full of symbolic power, since the memorial stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the heroic act for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918; through dense fog and under heavy fire from field cannons and machine guns.
Later he pushed forward to the fire line and led the line forward with the "greatest bravery" before he rushed forward with a field weapon alone and shut off three of the military units.
Colonel Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918; a little over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of his grandfather were something he could never live up to, and at the same time something that makes one humble.
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann he laid a wreath after the parade under the direction of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt very honored to be able to participate in the parade, and added that the bravery of a real hero would be visible mainly through the support of many people.
MMA fans stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, instead there was Peppa Pig
Imagine that you stayed awake all night to watch an exciting Bellator 206, and then you can't watch the main event.
The San Jose bill contained 13 fights, including 6 on the main map, and was broadcast live all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 p.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, the audience in the United Kingdom did not marvel at seeing Peppa Pig suddenly.
Some remained untouched after they stayed awake until the early morning hours to see the fight in particular.
A fan on Twitter described the change to the movie character as some sort of bad joke.
"Because of government regulations, these contents are considered non-youth-free, so that they had to be changed to a children's show at 6 o'clock," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President in Marketing and Communication at Bellator when he was interviewed for the transfer.
"Peppa, the pig, exactly."
The CEO of Bellator, Scott Coker, announced that the company will work on the schedule to take future viewers from the United Kingdom into account.
"I think the problem might have been solved by replay," he said.
“But it is 6 a.m. on a Sunday with the audience in the UK, and we will not solve the incident until Sunday our time, Monday local time there.
But we'll stay tuned.
There was a lot of communication during the change. It went quite well and it wasn't always nice.
We have tried to solve the problem, and have assumed that it is a technical problem.
What was not the case was a problem on the part of the government.
I promise this won't happen again.
We will reduce the whole to 5 instead of 6 fights, as in the normal case, and we have tried to offer the fans the best possible experience.
The whole situation is quite regrettable."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels "substantiated" in the subject of sexuality
Tom Daley, who has participated as a water jumper in various Olympic games, says that he grew up feeling that he was inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality. But this feeling had motivated him to be so successful.
The 24-year-old thought that he had only realized at the secondary school that he was different from others.
On the first radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Lavorne, he said that he spoke on gay rights to encourage others.
He also said that since he became a father, the victory at the Olympics is not so important to him.
The actual moderator of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, pauses illness for several months.
In the first shipment of Laverne he said that earlier he regarded himself as inferior compared to others, since love for boys and girls was totally unacceptable socially.
He said: "To this day, feeling is inferior to others and different from the others, reason for my power and strength and ultimately for my success."
He wanted to prove that he was a very special personality to disappoint no one when his sexual orientation became known.
The two-time bronze medal winner at the Olympics is today a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to advance the decriminalisation of homosexuality in other countries.
He said that he spoke on this subject because fortunately he can live without restrictions and without discrimination and wants to encourage others.
The triple world champion fell in love with the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013. The realization of falling in love with a man was an absolute surprise to him.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner in the previous year, but he shared that the age difference was never a topic.
He means if you had to go through so much as a child and a teenager – he took part in the Olympic Games with 14 for the first time and his father died of cancer three years later, it is difficult to find someone of the same age with similar experiences.
Since June, the couple have had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley believes that his entire vision has changed since then.
Last year, everything had turned around gold medals with him.
But for him, there are now more important than Olympic gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his main winner.
He has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after the diagnosis of brain tumor.
Daley said that his father did not accept the approaching death, and one of the last things he asked for was the tickets for London in 2012, because he wanted to be at the front.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there anymore," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after that did I finally realize that he was not invincible," he continued.
In the following year, Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympics.
“I just knew it was always my dream to dive in front of the local audience during Olympic games – that was the madness,” he said.
His first song selection – Proud of Heather Small – was also influenced by this. He heard the song in advance of the Olympic Games and still cared for goosebumps.

Mickelson, who is currently not in shape, sits at the Ryder Cup on Saturday on the replacement bank
The American Phil Mickelson will record his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he has to make a lot of effort so that it doesn't turn into a debacle.
Mickelson, who plays at the event for the 12th time, was sent to the reserve bank by Captain Jim Fury for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the heart of the event as usual, the five-time major champion spent his day in cheering others and working at his game, hoping to fix the problems that burdened him.
Even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old Mickelson was never the most direct golfer and thus no ideal occupation for the narrow Le Golf National golf course, where misguided balls are regularly punished.
And as if the place itself were not discouraging enough, Mickelson meets the perfectionist British Open champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth game on Sunday, who joined Tommy Fleetwood, newcomer in these tournaments to win all four games this week.
If the Americans leave a hot start at the 12 single games with four points behind, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely decisive.
Fury confidently expressed himself to Mickelson and could not add much to it.
"He was fully aware of his present role, gave me a slap on my back and put his arm around me and said he was ready for tomorrow," said Furyk.
“He has quite a lot of confidence.
He is one of the world's known personalities and he has done so much for these teams in the past and also this week.
I didn't think he'd be there for two games.
I had introduced myself more, but that's how it went and that's what we expected.
He wants to be there like everyone else."
Mickelson will reach the Nick Faldos record for most Rider Cup games performed on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup racetrack that never quite matched the highlights of its personal record.
Mickelson can record 18 victories, had to strike 20 defeats and reached seven half-times, although Furyk announced that his presence alone has enriched the team.
"He is funny and sarcastic, original and likes to make a few jokes, and he is a great person who is popular with the whole team," he said.
“I think the younger players were happy to get to know him a little more this week. It was fun to see them.
He is a truly interesting person who gives many impulses."
Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that it can soon be over with the lead.
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advantage that leads to the last single games in the Ryder Cup can quickly become an unpleasant situation.
The Dane debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead against the Americans, but only just over the finish line and went into leadership with the lowest possible lead and achieved a victory of 141⁄2–131⁄2.
"The thought remains that we had a great advantage in Valderrama, we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but that was only scarce," said Bjørn (pictured in the photo), after he had seen the victory 5–3 of the class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The experience shows me and all the team members that it's not over.
It's going to be okay tomorrow.
Get in the bag and do exactly the right thing.
The whole thing is only over when the points are on the scoreboard.
We have a goal. We want to win this trophy, and right there is our focus.
I've always said that I'm concentrating on the 12 players on our side, but we're fully aware of what's facing us on the other hand: the best players in the world."
Rejoicing about the performance that his players had performed on a difficult golf course, Bjorn continued: “I would never miss this.
Tomorrow another caliber.
Tomorrow, individual services are in the foreground, and this is a completely different matter.
It's great to work with a partner when things are going well, but if you're out there alone, you're being tested up to the limits of your skills as a golfer.
You have to make this clear to the players: get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you let your partner behind you and he also has to get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will make sure that his players individually cut better off than in the team, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Fury himself stood on both sides of those great turnarounds on the last day of the tournament. He stood in Brookline on the winner’s side before he stood on the side of the losers after Europe’s “Wonder of Medinah”.
"I remember every damn word," he answered the question as Ben Crenshaw, the captain of the year 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you’d like to take off the quick start you’ve seen in Brookline and Medinah.
When the momentum moves in one direction, it puts the middle games under a lot of pressure.
We set up our team accordingly and send our boys out as we feel, you know, we try to enchant tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of countering, he has to face Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as another European in the upper half of the ranking.
"I decided for the boys in this order because I believe it covers everything," Bjorn said about his selection for the individual encounters.
Germany's new warship delayed again
The newest frigate of the German Navy should have been put in service in 2014 to replace warships from the period of the Cold War. However, according to local media it will be delivered due to faulty systems and rapidly growing costs only at the earliest next year.
The commissioning of the 'Rheinland-Pfalz', the lead ship of the brand new frigates of the 'Baden-Wuerttemberg' class, was now postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the time called for a military spokesman.
The ship should have been put into service in 2014, but the ambitious project was plagued by disturbing problems after delivery.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg-Class, which were ordered by the Navy in 2007, are to replace the old frigates of the Bremen-Class.
They are intended to include a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft missiles and target missiles as well as core technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
Another important feature are longer maintenance periods. It should be possible that the latest frigates do not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
However, the ongoing delays may result in the highly modern warships that Germany is supposed to represent as sea power being obsolete at the time of its commissioning, according to Die Zeit.
Last year the Frigate F125, followed by the accident, went into headlines when the German Navy officially refused to take off the ship and returned it to the Hamburg Blohm & Voss shipyard.
This was the first time that the Navy returned a ship after its delivery to the shipyard.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media called a number of significant "software and hardware faults" which would have rendered the new ship useless in a combat situation.
Software problems are particularly serious, since ships in the Baden-Württemberg class are operated by only 120 sailors, only about half as many as on the older frigates of the Bremen class.
It was also known that the ship is far too difficult, which leads to performance losses and prevents the Marine from carrying out upgrade measures in the future.
The 7000 tonnes of heavy 'Rheinland-Pfalz' was apparently twice as heavy as ships with a similar class used by Germany during World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the costs of the entire project, including crew training costs, have also become a problem.
Apparently, the cost increased to stunning €3.1 billion, compared with the originally planned €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly important given the recent warnings that the German Sea Force is shrinking.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the German Bundestag's military officer, confirmed that the navy "going out of capable ships".
Bartels said that the problem increased over time, as old ships were out of service but no replacement ships had been provided.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could be taken from the Navy.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Bats
In an estate in the Scottish Highlands, new research will be carried out to show how bats use the landscape in food search.
It is hoped that the results will enable further insights into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help to initiate future nature conservation activities.
The study carried out by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will detect dwarf and mosquito bats as well as the brown Langohr and water bats in Inverewe Garden in West Ross.
Special recording devices are placed at key positions on the plot to record bat activities throughout the season.
Employees of the NHS and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies with portable detectors.
When analysing all recordings by experts, the frequency of bat calls is determined and what species does.
A map and a report of the habitat will then be created to create a detailed picture of their behaviour at landscape level.
Rob Dewar, conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how these are used by each species.
These data will help to determine the benefits of measures to manage the habitat, such as the creation of meadows, and to show how to preserve forest areas for bats and other related species.
The bat stocks in Scotland and the whole of the United Kingdom have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development, which have an impact on sleeping places and lead to the loss of living space.
Windwheels and lighting can also pose a risk, as can fly-flying and the chemical treatment of building materials or also attacks by house cats.
Bats are not really blind.
However, their ears are more useful than their eyes because of their night hunting habits when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echotype to detect insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout Scotland, takes the theme of bats very seriously.
He has 10 trained experts who regularly carry out examinations, inspections of sleeping places and sometimes rescue measures.
The organization has even established Scotland's first and only bat reserve in the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's 10 bat species.
Guts manager David Thompson explains that the property is the ideal habitat for them.
"Here in Threeave we have a great area for bats," he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent habitat.
But there are many things we do not yet know about bats, so here and on other goods we carry out these works that will help us learn more about what bats need to feel comfortable."
He emphasises the importance of excluding the presence of bats before maintenance work in the goods, since it is possible that the accidental destruction of a single nest site could kill up to 400 females and young animals and the entire population on the spot.
Bats are under protection and it is illegal to kill them, to harass them or to destroy them or their nest sites.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish wife of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the population to help.
She explains: "We still need to learn a lot about bats, and in many of our species we do not know how they are about their populations."
Ronaldo disbands rape charges while his lawyers want to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called rape charges against him "Fake News" and said that people want to be "famous" by using his name.
His lawyers are planning to sue the news magazine The mirror who published the allegations.
The storm of the national team of Portugal and Juventus Turin was accused of rapeing an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He then allegedly paid her 375,000 dollars to buy her silence on the incident, says Der Spiegel on Friday.
In an Instagram live video to his 142 million followers, the 33-year-old Ronaldo named the reports "Fake News" hours after their release.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What she reported today: Fake News," said the five-time winner of the balloon d’Or into the camera.
“You want to profile yourself by using my name.
That's normal.
You want to get famous with my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is good," added the player smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue the mirror on the grounds of the allegations which, according to Reuters, they referred to as 'inadmissible reporting on private sector suspicions'.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player demanded compensation for “moral damage in a level that is equivalent to the severity of the legal violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident should have taken place in a suite of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in 2009.
After getting to know each other at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the player's room, where, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada, he had mainly raped them anal.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo went to the knees after the alleged incident, and she said that he was "99 percent a good guy" who was "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but said it was agreeable.
Mayorga also claims that she had gone to the police and had been photographed in a hospital by her injuries, but later agreed to an out-of-court agreement because she had "afraid of retaliation" and took care to be "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old said that they are now trying to break up the agreement, as it is still traumatized due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was just standing at the time of the alleged incident to switch from Manchester United to Real Madrid and changed this summer in a 100 million euro deal to the Italian giant Juve.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would “everlasting regret” the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would “repent forever” if, after Brexit, it lost its status as a leading global car manufacturer, said Minister for Economic Affairs Greg Clark.
He continued to say that it was "disquieting" that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily interrupt production at the Burnaston plant at Derby, should Britain leave the EU.
"We need a deal," says Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer stated that the impact of border delays in a no-deal Brexit could lead to the loss of jobs.
Last year the plant in Burnaston, where Toyota's product lines Auris and Avensis are produced, produced almost 150,000 vehicles, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I am convinced that we will experience production stops in our plant at the end of March at an uncontrolled Brexit," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's Managing Director at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed fears about a hard EU exit without agreement and its impact on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says that it will close its mini plant in Oxford after Brexit for a month.
According to the car manufacturers, the main concerns are related to risks within the supply chain in a hard Brexit.
Toyota's manufacturing plant is operated on a "just-in-time" basis, which means that the parts are delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers both from the UK and the EU to manufacture the cars on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be interruptions at the borders which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and bottlenecks in the parts.
It was impossible for Toyota to maintain a stock at Derbyshire plant that was sufficient for longer than a day, the company explained why production had to be interrupted.
Clark explained that Theresa May's Chequers plan on the future relationship with the EU "is precisely designed to avoid such border controls".
“We need a deal. We want the best deal, which, as I said, allows us not only to enjoy the current success but also to seize this opportunity,” he said in the BBC Radio 4 broadcast today.
"The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we need to be able to continue the very successful supply chains so far."
Toyota could not indicate how long production would have to be interrupted, but warned in the long term that additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and who is the senior official of the Unite union, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “My experience of this job never comes back once they are gone.
One government speaker said: 'We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.'
Trump's planned meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again according to White House data
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein could be postponed for another week, while the dispute over the candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continued, was called from the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein has oversees the work of the special investigator Robert Mueller, who investigates the election interferences through Russia, connections between Trump's consultants and Russia, and a possible judicial obstacle by the president.
The question of whether Trump would fire the Deputy Justice Minister and thus jeopardize Mueller's independence has been the subject of rumors in Washington for months.
At the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein addressed the possibility of secretly recording his conversations with Trump and the President's appointment with the 25th Constitutional Supplement.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday, while new reports of his alleged resignation became known.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was held at the UN General Assembly in New York at that time, was announced for the next Thursday,
Trump said that he would not let Rosenstein go, but then the meeting was moved to avoid colliding with the hearing before the US Senate Judicial Committee, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who had accused him of sexual abuse.
On Friday, Trump arranged for a one-week FBI investigation of the allegations against Kavanaugh, thereby delaying the full vote of the Senate.
Trump's press spokesperson Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
She replied to a question about the meeting with Rosenstein: 'A date has not yet been set for it; it could be this week, but I can also imagine that it will be postponed by another week, given all the things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would probably object to this statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since 10 September.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked her the reason.
Sanders explained that the low frequency of the press conferences did not add to an aversion to the 'effect hashing' of the TV reporters, but admitted: 'I would not deny that they are active hashing'.
She then claimed that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The President makes more question-and-answer rounds than any President before him," she said, without providing precise evidence: 'We have seen these figures.'
There will still be press conferences, according to Sanders, but it is “if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States direct questions, but far better than talking to me.
We often try to do this and you have seen that we have done this often in the last few weeks, and that will take the place of the press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why this is so when he performed a bizarre appearance in front of the assembled reporters.
Minister of Health writes about Brexit concerns about EU workers in Scottish NHS
The Minister for Health is addressing people from the EU, who work in Scotland's National Health Service (NHS), to express the country's gratitude and express their wish to remain in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to bear the cost of requests for residence permits for EU citizens working in the decentralised public service of Scotland.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “During the summer the withdrawal negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU were continued and decisions are expected this autumn.
However, the UK government has also reinforced the preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I am aware of what disturbing times this must be for you all.
That is why I wanted to express once again how much I value the contribution of each and every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and thus benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is fully your home and we would be very pleased if you would stay here."
Christion Abercrombie was subjected to an emergency surgery following a head injury
The linebacker of Tennessee State Tigers Christion Abercrombie was subjected to an emergency operation, according to information from Mike Organ of Tennessee State, after a head injury which he committed on Saturday at the 31-27 defeat of the Vanderbilt Commodore.
Rod Reed, head coach of Tennessee State, explained that the injury occurred shortly before the half-life break.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed there," says Reed.
Trainer and medical staff supplied abercrombie on the sideline with oxygen before it was placed on a carry and transported for further investigations.
A spokesman for Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie has left the OP at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details about the type or extent of injury are yet known" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury happened.
Abercrombie, a so-called Redshirt, plays at Tennessee State in his first season after switching from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 tackles, which increased his total number to 18 tackles in the season.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp tax for the real estate purchase in the United Kingdom
In future, investors from abroad will have to pay a higher stamp tax for the purchase of properties in the United Kingdom.
This step is to halt the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign for young voters
The increase in the stamp fee will concern all those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Finance expects additional revenue of up to 120 million pounds per year to help homeless people
Theresa May will today announce that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp fee if you buy properties in the United Kingdom, benefiting the more revenue homeless.
This step represents an attempt to contain Jeremy Corbyn's success in young voters who promise to provide more affordable housing and take seniors to the sights.
The increase in the tax on stamps is levied on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional revenue is to be allocated to the government campaign against homelessness.
In addition to the current stamp tax and including the two-year increase in the number of second-dwelling dwellings left for rent, the surcharge could amount to up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the step with additional revenue of up to 120 million pounds per year.
Estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by investors who are not based in the United Kingdom. This will drive prices up and make it more difficult for first-time buyers to take foot in the real estate business.
Many prosperous areas of the country, particularly in the capital, have become “spirit cities” due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the UK.
The new strategy follows only a few weeks after Boris Johnson decided to reduce the stamp tax in order to allow more young people to own the first home.
He accused construction companies of holding up real estate prices by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable apartments to end Britain's 'dwelling damage'.
The opposition leader Corbyn announced an exciting series of proposals for housing reforms that range from a rental price commitment to the ban on housing without a valid reason.
He also wants to grant city councils more powers in the construction of new apartments.
May explained: “Last year I said that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream, according to which life from generation to generation should be improved.
And that means repairing our broken apartment market.
The UK will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build a life.
However, it may not be right for people who do not live in the UK and for companies based abroad to buy real estate as easily as for hard-working British citizens.
The dream of the home has become too distant for too many people and the indignity of homelessness remains a problem too great."
Jack Ross: “My biggest goal is to manage Scotland”
Jack Ross, head of Sunderland, says that it is his “largest goal” to become the manager of the Scottish team sometime.
The 42-year-old Schotte enjoys the challenge of reviving the club from the north-east of England, which is in third place in the League One and lacks the three points at the top.
He moved to the stadium of Light this summer after he led St. Mirren back to the first Scottish league in the last season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I made it to the bank and that was’s,” Ross told the broadcast Sports Sound of BBC Scotland.
“But as a child, I have often seen Scotland playing in Hampden with my father and that’s something that always drags me back.
However, this possibility would only come if I was successful in the association management."
Ross' predecessors in the role of manager of Sunderland include Dock Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic said not to be afraid to step into the footsteps of such established names at such a club after he previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The success will be measured at the moment by whether I can return the club to the Premier League.
In view of the structure and possibilities of this association, he is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he said.
"It is not an easy task to get him there, but I would only appreciate my time here as a success if I brought the club back there."
Ross can present a first three-year management career, after a phase as deputy head of Dumbarton and a 15-month career as coach in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the relegation to the third league and helped St. Mirren from the edge of the relegation to win the championship in the following season.
Ross says that he feels more comfortable now than ever before in his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"This was probably a real path of divorce," he recalls when he assumed the responsibility of Alloa.
“I really think management was the right thing for me, more than games.
It sounds funny because I didn't feel bad, could live well and experienced some very pleasant high phases.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things you have to go through every week.
I still do this through stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I have always wanted to manage and now I do it. I have never felt so comfortable in my skin as an adult throughout my life."

The perfect time for a glass of beer is on Saturday at 5:30 p.m., so a study
The heat wave in the summer has missed a surge in the revenue of Britain's crispy pubs, while restaurant chains are under greater pressure.
In July, public and bar companies recorded sales growth of 2.7 per cent. However, according to statistics, revenue from restaurants fell by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin of CGA, which compiled the figures, said: “Anhalt Solarschein and England’s longer than expected continued participation in the football world championship meant that July followed a similar pattern as the previous June, in which Pubs recorded sales increases of 2.8 percent. However, restaurant met even harder.
The 1.8 percent decline in the restaurant industry in June continued to increase in July.
Pubs and bars with focus on drinks showed by far the best performance, with a surface-adjusted sales development that increased higher than they did at restaurants.
Pubs with focus on food also suffered in the sun, but not as drastic as the restaurant operators.
It seems like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In the managed pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6 per cent in the month, while food sales fell by three per cent."
Paul Newman, analysts for the RSM leisure and restaurant industry, said: “These results continue the trend we have been able to observe since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of important social or sporting events remain the main factors for out-of-home sales.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle with problems, but sales losses of 4.8 percent compared to the previous year will be particularly painful in addition to continuing cost pressures.
The long, hot summer could not have come any worse for companies with a focus on food, and it remains to be seen whether the more moderate temperatures in August will provide the much needed breath."
Overall sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July and reflected the decline in brand rollouts.
The industry sales monitor Coffer Peach Tracker for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK collects and analyzes performance data from 47 active companies with combined sales of over 9 billion pounds and is the recognized industry benchmark.
One in five children has secret accounts on social media that it hides from its parents
A study shows that every fifth child, some just 11 years old, has secret accounts on social media that keep it secret from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 students in secondary schools has found an increase on so-called 'Fake Insta' pages
The message fires fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of the students reported having a "main account" to show their parents
One in five children, some just 11 years old, creates accounts on social media that can keep it secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students in secondary schools showed a rapid increase in so-called "Fake Insta" accounts, a reference to the photo-sharing website Instagram.
The message fires fears that sexual content will be shared.
Twenty percent of the students reported having a clean “main account” that they can show their parents to own but also private accounts.
A mother who came across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who invited others to "rap me."
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which agreed to own private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, Chairman of the HMC, said: "It is devastating that so many teenagers are seduced into creating online rooms in which parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle becomes the 'stim of athletes' in the Scottish Sports Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive member in the Council of Scottish Athletics Association Scottish Athletics at its annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most outstanding athlete and the chairman Ian Beattie described the choice as a great opportunity for sports officials to benefit from their extensive international experience over the last decade.
"Eilidh is respected in the athletics community of Scotland, the UK and the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly from their choice in the Council," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am looking forward to acting as the voice of the athletes and I hope that I can make a real contribution to sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the distance over 200 and 400 meters in 1996 at the Olympic Games in Atlanta, calls a total of four Olympic gold medals his own and is now often seen as a BBC expert, could no longer run after a temporary bleeding disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors say no one can say if or how far I'm going to heal.
It was hard work, but I completely recovered, learned to run again and do mobility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging news!"
An advertisement for milk pumps that compares mothers to cows provides excitement in the network
A manufacturer of milk pumps provided excitement in the network with an advertising clip in which breast-feeding mothers are compared with the milking of cows.
The manufacturer of consumer technology, Elvie, has published a music video, which is not very serious, in order to emphasize the freedom that the pump gives to breast-feeding mothers, in order to introduce the 'first low-noise milk pump' to the market.
Four real mothers dance in a barn filled with cows in the background to a song that contains lines of text such as: "Yes, I'm milking, but you don't see a cock at me" or "if you haven't noticed it, these are not udders but my breasts."
The chorus continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
However, the advertising published on the company's Facebook page has triggered a controversy on the web.
With 77,000 accesses and hundreds of comments, the video came across mixed reactions in the audience, many of whom say that it is harmless to the "frights" of the milk industry.
“It was a very bad decision to apply for this product with cows.
Just as we do, they must become pregnant and bear a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their boys will be taken away within a few days of birth," said one comment.
The milk pump from Elvie fits discreetly into a still bra (elvie/mother)
Another comment was: “Exceptably traumatic for mother and baby.
But hey, why don't we use them to apply for a milk pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another person added: "Such a non-realistic advertising."
Others defended the advertisement and one woman admitted that you found the song "urcomic".
“I think that’s a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I were still breastfeeding.
When I was pumping, I felt exactly like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I'm not trying to overinterpret it.
This is a brilliant product," one person wrote.
Another person commented: "This is a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who use milk pumps (often at the workplace or in toilets) and feel like "cow".
This is not advertising for or against the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group reveals to women that everyone danced with the discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who use milk pumps indicate that they feel like dairy cows.
The pump of Elvie, however, is completely quiet, has no wires or hoses and fits discreetly into a still bra, giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies or even go out during the pumping process.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, said: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it earned a daring and provocative market launch.
By comparing breast-feeding mothers with dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk pumps and all the challenges involved, while at the same time presenting the incredible sense of freedom that allows the new pump.
This is not the first time that the pump of Elvie got into the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, designer Marta Jakubowski released a double mother on the Catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been quietly taken to a tent town on the Texan border
The number of internal migrant children is as high as never before, although the number of monthly crossings has remained relatively equal, among other things because intensified rhetoric and measures by the Trump government have made it more difficult to accommodate children with supervisors.
Traditionally, most caregivers were illegal immigrants themselves and are now afraid to become even the target for an expulsion when they report to take up a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their household would have to print their fingerprints and share these data with immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Customs Office Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declared before Congress that the Authority had arrested dozens of people who had applied for care of unaccompanied minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70 percent of the prisoners had no prior entries in the criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of people who are either self-employed or members of a household of a caregiver are illegally staying in the country and a large proportion of them are non-residents.
That is why we will continue to pursue these people," said Albion.
In order to deal more quickly with the cases of the children, the officials introduced new rules, which according to the staff of the accommodation in some children, required to appear within a month instead of 60 days after the detention, which was previously the standard.
Many will appear via video and not personally to appear in front of an immigration judge for their legal status.
If negative decisions are taken, the person is quickly expelled.
The longer these children remain in custody, the more likely it is, according to information from the accommodation staff as well as reports that have been known from the system over the past month, that they are being apprehensive and depressed, which can lead to violent breakouts or breakout attempts.
Defenders say that these concerns are reinforced by a larger facility such as tornillo, as there are signs that a child has problems that are easily overlooked due to size.
They also explained that it could strengthen traumas that many of the children already suffer when they are taken to a tent city without emotional preparation or enough time to say goodbye to friends.
Syria calls on American, French and Turkish crews to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the civil war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, stated that the foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil and were "treated accordingly" with the pretext of fighting terrorism.
“You must immediately and unconditionally withdraw,” he explained to the congregation.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror was almost over" in Syria, where since 2011 more than 360,000 people died and millions more people were expelled from their homes.
He said that Damascus "will continue to fight this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are cleaned up" both by terrorist groups and by "every illegal foreign presence".
The United States has deployed about 2000 soldiers in Syria, who mainly train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs, who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in the warring country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions for their return had been met and he accused 'some Western countries' of 'spreading irrational fears' of deterring refugees from going home.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to make their return possible," he said.
'They are politicizing a purely humanitarian matter'.
The United States and the European Union warned that no reconstruction aid would be granted for Syria as long as there was no political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The diplomats of the UN stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last major rebel highburg Idlib represents the possibility of advance political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey turned a wide-ranging offensive of the Syrian armed forces supported by Russia to the province in which three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had 'clear deadlines' and expressed his hope that military action against jihadists, including fighters of the Nusra Front, allied to Al-Qaeda, will be carried out which will be 'extinguished'.
UN representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee, consisting of members of government and opposition, to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Moualem called the terms of the Syrian government to participate in the Committee and stated that his work should be limited to the "recast of the articles of the current Constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win his re-election
With this logic, Trump would win his re-election in 2020, should not, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, an assassination or a scandal end his presidency in advance.
This would undoubtedly be 'the most dramatic finale of a presidency of all time'.
So far, there's no evidence that the audience would be satisfied.
Since 2014, the best transmission time switch-on rates at CNN have more than doubled to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News reaches an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best broadcast time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” led the switch-on rates to 3.5 million viewers in evenings with important news.
"This is like a fire that magically attracts people, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Bear, showrunner of the drama series "Designed Survivor" on TV channel ABC about a cabinet member who will be president after an attack destroys the capitol.
Nell Scovell, an old comedy writer and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club” has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he'd choose Trump.
She asked him the reason.
“He said, ‘because he’s making me laugh’” Scovell told me.
The chaos is entertaining.
Of course, the stories from Washington, as opposed to everything on television, can determine the future of the principle decision on abortions Roe v. Wade, the possible merger of families and the health of the global economy.
Turning it off is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet, it is also possible to be an informed citizen if you become aware of having already watched six hours of a round of experts using sources from the so-called "deep background" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 expensive bomber jacket made of ostrich leather ( Washington Post said a "cloth rich in self-esteem") or the effects of Stormy Daniel's tearful description of Trump, hem, anatomy.
For my part, Super Mario will never be able to see again with the same eyes.
"A part of what he does can be felt like a reality show he imagines every night," says Brent Montgomery, Chief Executive Officer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and Creator of the series "The Three of the Pfandhaus", about Trump's rotating occupation and daily action (a dispute with the football league NFL from the fence breaking Kim Jong-un prizes).

When I reached Fleiss this week, it was sunny 27 degrees in front of his house on the northern coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he froze in and looked at MSNBC while he recorded CNN at the same time.
He just couldn't get off the screen, not if Judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh was right in front of the Senate's Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy missions at the time and people said ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization’,” Fleiss told me.
"I thought that was kind of a joke, but it turned out they were right."

Donations flow the narrowest races around seats in Congress in the intermediate elections
It is little surprising that the 17th electoral district of Pennsylvania is flooded by donations, thanks to the newly drawn borders of the electoral district, which led to two officials standing around the same seat in the race.
The recently redrawn suburb district in Pittsburg allows the Democrat Conor Lamb to enter, who won his seat in another district in the course of a special election in the previous spring.
Lamb opposes another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is greatly overlapping with the new 17th district.
The cards were redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were destroyed against the Constitution and manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district triggered an exchange of election funding between the major financial weapons of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a tight victory in a highly respected special election in March around the 18th constituency of the state.
This seat was held by a Republican for over a decade and Trump won the lead with 20 percentage points.
Polit experts give the Democrats an easy lead.
The US tested El Salvador's punishment for its support for China, but then returned
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing without encountering great resistance from Washington.
Trump attended a friendly meeting with the president of Panama's Juan Carlos Valero in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until partnered the management team of the Trump Organization.
Officials of the US Department of Foreign Affairs have decided to remove the heads of all foreign representatives from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of 'the recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan', says Heather Nauert, Minister of State spokesperson in an opinion at the beginning of the month.
However, in the case of El Salvador, only consideration was given to sanctions that were estimated to be $140 million in 2017 in US aid, including for drug control, development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, including reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murderous deaths.
While internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials moved a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which should follow a similar meeting in the previous year and represented a step forward in efforts to stop migrants from moving towards the US.
In mid-September, however, high government officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and so effectively ended the consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak at the conference that was held on mid-October, in order to give a sign of the importance that the government of the Assembly attaches to it, according to diplomatic statements.
The three American diplomatic representatives are silent and quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any new harsh announcements or criminal sanctions from Washington.
A government speaker from John Bolton rejected an opinion on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to speak on the internal meetings under the terms of anonymity.
Their comments were confirmed by an external analyst close to the government, who also spoke under the condition of anonymity.

The next big surprise could be the report by the special investigator Robert Mueller on Trump's possible obstacles to justice, for which there is now sufficient evidence in the public.
Mueller now allegedly also investigates whether Trump's campaign team has been conspiring with Russia in its attack on the U.S. elections.
Should the majority of Congress change, Trump appears confronted with an organ that forces him to account, exactly at the time he gets past the electorate; and possibly before a jury.
These are many ‘wish’ and I do not want to say that the Donald Trumps case, or that of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we must make decisions that will affect how long the battle will last.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to carry out a coup against Hitler if only the West had resisted him and had supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We have failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of barbarism that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the unstoppable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are facing several such turning points.
What if Trump leaves Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, the man who decides on the future of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's kitchen has been in devil's kitchen since this newspaper last year reported that he proposed to secretly record the president and speculate about whether he was unfit for office.
Rosenstein denies the portrayal of the New York Times.
“How will we respond if the newly ordered FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or is confirmed in office despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false statements?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-elections for a congress that forces Trump to account?
If we fail in these tests, we'll have a long winter ahead of us.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of what I learned in Prague.

Graham Dorrans by the Rangers optimistically before the game against Vienna
The Rangers receive Rapid Wien on Thursday knowing that a victory against the Austrians after the impressive Remis against Villareal in Spain at the beginning of the month will put them in a good position for the qualification of the Group G of the Europe League.
Due to a knee injury, Graham Dorrans could not appear up to 2-2 equals against Villareal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a stepping board for bigger ones.
"This was an important point for us, because Villareal is very good," said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game with our conviction that we can do something about it and we drove home with a point.
Perhaps we could have won at the end, but overall, a decision was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we worked in the second half and then were the better team.
Thursday will be another big European evening.
Hopefully we get three points, but this will be a hard game, as they have achieved a good result in the last game. But I am sure that we can do this with the audience behind us and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a kind of wellness factor.
The team is good and the boys are really good at it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now look forward, leave the last season behind us and be successful."
Fear of retirement leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although the survey participants knew exactly how to care for them, only a few of them talked to their family members.
About half of the participants in the nationalwide study reported that they should talk to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said to talk to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but do not take the necessary steps to conduct the conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance division of Nationwide.
You should start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your wishes in time.
Work with your consultant and family to discuss where and how you want to be cared for, as these decisions can be an important factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor on board: your consultant can also help you find a way to finance these expenses.
Your long-term financial decisions can include a traditional care insurance, a hybrid capital-creating life insurance to help cover these costs or self-insurance with your own assets - as long as they own the money.
Work out your legal documents: Turn over legal disputes at the last minute.
Set up a precautionary measure so that you instruct a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that the health professionals meet your needs, you should be unable to express them yourself.
Consider also a power of attorney for your finances.
You choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and ensures that your bills are paid, you should not be able to do so.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication or allergies?

Man in Ilfracombe shot several times with air rifle
A man was shot several times with an air rifle when he went home after working with friends.
The victim, a man in the 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, belly and hand.
Officials described the shots that took place at about 02:30 p.m. in the UK, as 'wild-hearted acts'.
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquake and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a severe earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, the authorities said. The number of dead is still to increase.
Because of the failed communication systems, auxiliary forces were unable to obtain information from the government district of Donggala, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with the strength of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 persons were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city just celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and the tsunami took place.
Donggala is a government district located in the northwestern part of Sulawesi Island, over 300 km (180 miles) long.
In the government district, an administrative unit below the province, there were an estimated 299,200 people in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of revenue from the Central Sulawesi industry, in particular the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesis.
Palu and Donggala have been victims of earthquakes and tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's Civil Protection Authority.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
West Donggala was met in 1996 by a Tsunami where nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific fire ring, and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in the north of Sumatra triggered a tsunami on December 26, which struck 14 countries and cost 226,000 lives in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, almost half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra between late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias Islands off the Sumatras coast.
2006: An earthquake with strength 6.8 shook the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the South Coast and called for almost 700 deaths.
2009: An earthquake with strength 7.6 hit the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with a strength of 7.5 shook one of the Mentawai Islands in front of Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters high, destroying dozens of villages and demanding about 300 lives.
2016: A slight earthquake shook the government district of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the mortal earthquake and tsunamis of 2004.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people died from collapse.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the Indonesian island of Lombok, popular among tourists, and claimed more than 500 deaths on the north side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the island.
Sarah Palin's son was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former Governor Alaskas and former candidates for Vice-President's office, was arrested due to allegations of body injury.
The 29-year-old palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested because of suspicion of domestic violence, the obstruction of domestic violence and the resistance to state violence, as a report published by Alaska Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he picked up a friend's phone when he wanted to get in touch with the police.
According to KTUU, Palin is under investigation in the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and it has been raised a deposit of 500 dollars.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where, when he was asked for his plea, he replied with "Not guilty, certainly," according to the network.
Palin is accused of committing three class A violations, which can be spent up to a year in prison and a fine of up to USD 250,000.
He is also burdened with a violation of the order of Class B, which can be punished with a day in prison and a fine of 2,000 dollars.
It's not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being negotiated before the Alaska Veteran’s Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, disability in the reporting of a crime and possession of weapons in connection with the incident.
His friend accused him of slapping her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran organizations in 2016 after she traced the behavior of her son to a post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his time in Iraq.
Tsunami after earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake that shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The quake with a strength of 7.5 triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communications networks have been interrupted and it is expected that the number of dead will increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of Central Sulawesi, which is north-east of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
On the social networks, videos circulate from the time the wave hit the country.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami met on the coast.
Federal Prosecution Demands Rare Death Penalty for Suspects in New York Terrorist Attack
The New York District Attorney's Office demands the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the defendant in the terrorist attack of New York City, which cost eight lives. This is a rare punishment that has no longer been imposed in the state since 1953 for a federal crime.
The 30-year-old Saipov is accused of having used a rented pick-up of the Home Depot construction chain for a terrorist attack, during which he rode on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan while driving pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, the plaintiffs have to prove that Saipov "targeted" the eight victims and "consciously" added serious injuries to the body, it is stated in the Memorandum of Understanding on the demand for the death penalty filed in the southern district of New York.
Both charges could be punished with death, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal investigating court sent Saipov a 22-point bill covering eight charges of the murder against the background of organized crime, which are normally used by state prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as an accusation of the violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack calls for 'basic planning and intent', according to the prosecutors, who described the way in which Saipov acted as 'abominable, cruel and depraved'.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov added the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco damage, pain and loss," said the explanation.
Five victims were Argentine tourists.
For over a decade, the southern district of New York has no longer pursued a case with the aim of demanding the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug suppliers and finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
In 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been accused two years before of the conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union, the death penalty was carried out in New York.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953 with the electric chair.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, was born in the days and months after the attack of lack of remorse, according to court documents.
He told investigators to feel good about what he did, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was actually inspired after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the charge.
He also requested police reports to hang the flag of ISIS in his hospital room.
He declared himself not guilty in all 22 charges.
David Patton, a public defender representing Saipov, said that she was "of course disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty will only prolong the trauma, which all the parties involved will suffer," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the charges not to demand the death penalty.
A Conservative Party member calls for NIGEL FARAGE to transfer the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize "the power of the people" today during a protest at the Tories Conference.
The former party leader of Ukip stated that politicians must 'feel the pressure' of the Eurosceptics, while a member of Theresa May's party suggested that Farage should conduct negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backtender Peter Bone explained to the protesters in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would be “ready to go outside” if Farage Brexit ministers were.
The challenge facing May in reconciling its deeply disputed parties was exacerbated by the fact that members of your party, who are for a stay in the EU, participated in a separate demonstration against Brexit that took place in the city.
The Prime Minister has problems keeping his compromise plan Chequers on track despite attacks by Brexit supporters, Brexit opponents and the EU.
Allies insisted that, despite the counter-reactions, they should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels, thus forcing Eurosceptics and the opposition Labour Party to decide between their package and the 'chaos'.
Bone explained at the Leave Means Leaf demonstration in Solihull that ‘Chequers belong to the garbage’.
He suggested that Farage should have been appointed a peer and that he should have been entrusted with responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, we would already be outside," he said.
Wellingborough's honourable Member added: 'I will stand for Brexit, but Chequers is a waste.'
He stressed his opposition to the EU: ‘We did not fight in world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone rejected allegations that public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: ‘The idea that the British people had changed their opinion and now want to remain in the EU is completely wrong.’
The Brexit chairman of the Conservative Andrea Jenkenys was also at the demonstration and explained to reporters: ‘I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The compromise is unpopular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and in our activists who actually go through the streets and make us elected.
Please give up Chequers and start listening.’
In a pointed message to May, she continued: ‘Prime Minister will keep their jobs if you keep their promises.’
Farage stated in a speech that politicians need to ‘feel pressure’, that they should be in a position to cheat on the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” says Farage.
“They are trying to cheat Brexit and that is why we are here today to tell them, ‘that is not the way you come’.
In front of an enthusiastic crowd, he continued: ‘I want you to let our political class, which is shortly before betraying Brexit, feel the pressure.
“We mobilise the power of the people of this country, which will help us win the referendum and never come to rest as long as we are not independent, self-managing, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A few activists waved banners of the Tories Against Brexit group, a group of Brexit opponents within May's party, which was launched on the weekend.
Lord Adonis, Peer of the Labour Party, made fun of the Tories that had security problems with a party app at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can make sure that the IT systems, as well as all the technology for Canada Plus, are available for the smooth border for free trade without frontiers in Ireland,” said Adonis.
‘This is a farce.
It just doesn’t exist for the good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to “examine” the presidential candidate
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November elections, she would "check the presidential candidate exactly".
The Boston Globe reports that the Democratic from Massachusetts spoke about her future on Saturday at a meeting with voters in West Massachusetts.
Warren, a prominent critic of President Donald Trump, is currently in the race for the Senate re-election against the Republican MPs in the Massachusetts Geoff Diehl Parliament, who was vice-president of Trump's campaign team in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was the focus of speculation that she could challenge Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke has been its 36th meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall format since Trump's inauguration.
One of the people present asked her if you would like to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that it was time for women to "go to Washington and repair our broken government and that includes women at the top."
Arrested after killing on LSU player Sims
Baton Rouge's police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect in the case of the deadly shots on LSU basketball player Wayde Sims was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference to arrest the 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. Eastern Time.
They had published a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man to be seen on the recordings.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot on Friday morning near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot injury on his head and died as a result of this injury," according to information from the sports media portal 247 sports by the police chief Murphy J. Paul on Saturday told the media.
Wayde wanted to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to have been at the crime scene and possession of a weapon and shot at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incidents and detained in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The two-meter Sims grew up in Baton Rouge and played in 32 games with 10 start-ups in the last season and could have an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Great price of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world champion's title after his team gave him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the time Valtteri Bottas landed in qualifying in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that the stable order of Mercedes would play a major role in the race.
From the pole position, Bottas managed to make a good start and it was almost like he led Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel first went into the box and let Hamilton hit the traffic at the end of the driver's field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the box one round later and landed behind Vettel, but overtook Hamilton after a short wheel-on-wheel manoeuvre, where the Ferrari pilot resisted to release the inside with the risk of holding two moves to defend the third curve.
Max Verstappen started on one of the back squares of the field and was on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round in the seventh place.
He was then the fastest for most of the race, as he held on to his tires to finish quickly and to overtake Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
He eventually entered the box in the 44th round and failed to take a step in the remaining eight rounds, while Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day, as Valtteri made an excellent performance all weekend and acted like a real gentleman when he was supposed to let me by.
The team has done excellent work to achieve a double victory," said Hamilton.
A case of really bad body language
On Saturday, President Donald Trump made fun of a election event about Senator Diane Feinstein who insisted on not passing on to the press the letter of Christine Blasey Ford, in which he accused the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
At the event in West Virginia, President Ford's statement before the Senate's Judicial Committee did not address directly, but commented that the Senate's proceedings show that people are "common, evil and dishonest".
"One thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate is when you see the rage when you see people who are angry and mean and evil and dishonest," says the President.
“When you look at the leaks and then say, “Oh, I wasn’t.
It wasn't me."
Do You Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you responsible for the Leak?
Thinking of your answer... Publish the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
All right, just a minute.
Did we... No, we didn't publish it," he added by imitating the Senator's voice.
Feinstein was played with Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh in July and he was published in early September. However, Feinstein argues that the Leak comes from her office.
"I haven't hidden Dr. Ford's accusations, I haven't published your story," said Feinstein to the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter secret and I answered her request for secrecy."
Her Dementi did not seem to arrive at the president’s office, who said on Saturday evening at the election event: “I tell you one thing, that was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continuous defense of the judge candidate, accused of sexual assault by three women, the Democrats claimed that they would use the accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power with all means.
One sees the commonality, the evil, they don't care about who hurts them when they get under the wheels to gain power and control," said the president, according to the Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made the defeat again on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by a 5:3 win in the back game in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants were led by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier in the early days.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team back to balance before Dwyer reconstructed the lead of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard liked Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen won the victory with two goals.
This was unexpected for the men of Adam Keefe who struck Dundee on Friday evening 2-1 in Belfast, the third defeat in the Elite League in the season.
This was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, where the Giant won the three previous games.
Dwyer’s opening gate took place in the fourth minute after 3:35 minutes after a presentation by Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later David Rutherford delivered the template when Beauvillier expanded the lead.
In this exciting opening phase, Sullivan brought the home team back to the game after 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt Cownie left for his balancing tower after 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer ensured the leadership of the Giants before the half-life break when he reached his second gate of the evening shortly before the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard managed to get out again with a power play event in the 28th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee late in the second half of the game for the first time in the first time. Nielsen won his team with a fifth goal after almost half of the second half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home in the Milton Keynes Stadium next Friday.
Air Force pilots died after he made sure hundreds of people in a plane escaped the earthquake
A pilot pilot pilot in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he found the death to start a plane with hundreds of people on board safely.
Over 800 people died and many are missing after Sulawesi Island was shaken on Friday by a devastating earthquake that triggered a tsunami.
Strong earthquakes are still to be felt in the region and many people are trapped under debris in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save your life, the 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the swinging control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed to make sure that the flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, could be safely removed.
He jumped out of the tower when he thought he was coming down.
Agung died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesperson of the Indonesian Air Safety Service, explained that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, says Australia's ABC News.
“We have provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
We are deeply concerned about this message," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could increase to several thousand. The National Civil Protection Authority stated that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number is expected to rise, as many bodies are still below the debris, while others cannot be reached," said the spokesman of Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves with a height of up to 6 meters have destroyed Palu, which will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring supplies and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said Sky News: “Every minute a new ambulance comes with dead people.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Supermarkets are plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, Head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, CNN stated: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse."
Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said in a speech to the country’s military: “I ask you all day and night to work to accomplish all the tasks associated with evacuation.
Since you've been ready?" says CNN.
Indonesia was already shaken by earthquakes in Lombok this year, where over 550 people died.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini is now reported by a missing aircraft crash in Lagoon
The airline that conducted the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia is now reporting on a missing person after she first claimed that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini stated in a communication that they cannot say anything about the stay of a passenger until Saturday afternoon.
The airline said to work with the local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew members after the plane was plunged into the water when trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials reported that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline said that on Saturday there were still six passengers in the hospital, but they were in a stable condition.
The cause and the exact course of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and U.S. Navy both explained that the aircraft landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane was flying out of the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew very flat.
"This is a very good thing," says Jaynes.
Jaynes explained that he and others were able to wade to the emergency exits on the side of the sinking aircraft through shallow water.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed and suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working near the improvement of a site rushed to help with an inflatable boat to bring people to the coast before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
The data of the Aviation Safety Network can be found that 111 people were killed in crashes by airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them concerned Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the night in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the charges closed their evidence in the renegotiation of a case in which a man is accused of expelling a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst of the US Department of Justice Paul Rowlett spent hours as an expert in the field of information evaluation.
He explained to the jury how he reconstructed the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on her death night.
Rowlett said to have received position data from various mobile phones that showed that Tellis was together with Chambers on the night of her death. This contradicts his previous statements, says the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the period he reported to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford joined the stand on Saturday and said that he had not been in the city that day.
When the plaintiffs asked if Tellis had told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's pick-up that night, Sandford said that he had lied, "because my pick-up was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was the fact that Tellis reported to have known Chambers two weeks at her death date.
But cell phone records indicated that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that Tellis lost some time after Chamber's death their news, calls, and contact information from his cell phone.
"He took them out of his life," says Hale.
The defense is expected to start their pleas on Sunday.
The judge assumed that the proceedings were subsequently brought before the jury on that day.

One more black?!
New Yorker nanny sued couple for a release after "racist" SMS
A New York nanny sues a couple because of a discriminatory dismissal after she received a misguided message from the mother in which she complained that she was "still a black".
The couple disputed to be racist and compared the dispute with a 'pressive'.
The two-time mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her dismay when she found out that the new day's mother, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived at her first working day in 2016.
"A NEEEEEEEEEEEEEIN, NOT A MARCH," Plasco-Flaxman wrote her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending this to her husband, however, she sent the message to Maurice. Twice.
After recognizing her Fauxpas, the "worstly touched" Plasco-Flaxman Maurice dismissed and claimed that the open-minded African-American day-mother had done bad work and instead expected a Philippine woman, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her working day and then sent home with a blanket.
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for dismissal and makes a claim for compensation for the 350 dollars a day that they should have lasted for over six months, for which the job for which they had originally been booked, but without contract, and for which they would have lived with the couple.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do that," said the newspaper on Friday, "I know that is discrimination."
The couple rejected the racist accusations and argued that the release of the reasonable step was because they feared Maurice after they had insulted her not to be able to trust anymore.
“My wife sent her something that she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," explained husband Joel Plasco of the post office.
“But would you entrust your children to a person who was rude to them, even if it was accidental?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the case with a "expression" and explained that his wife was expecting a baby in just two months and was "in a difficult situation".
“You want to interest such a person?
That's not very nice," added the investment banker.
While the dispute continues, the couple were quickly condemned in public and appealed to the social media, where they were criticized for their behaviour and logic.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not identify themselves with a talking bear, revealing a new letter
Karen Jankel, daughter of the author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to get into someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
Today it is very funny with our knowledge of Paddington's enormous success."
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a small toy bear to write the children's book, had no problem with it, had been rejected and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication after his death was "bitterssweet".
She explained that her father was secretly proud of the success of Paddington, which she described as "very important family member".
"He was a very quiet man and didn't brag," Jankel said.
“Because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like if you have a child who does something special: you are proud, even if it wasn’t really your own performance.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although he invented and created him, he always gave Paddington himself responsible for his success."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone.
After the landing her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad regularly called to say that it looks really bad and that doctors gave her little chance," says Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I received the call from Nad, in which he told me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I told her, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that gave you the doctors to keep their hearts at the pumping, slowed down and left their bodies.
She had died shortly before and this was the moment when everything went down.
I could do nothing but wait while I knew what was going on.
I could not scream or howl because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to pull myself together."
Finally, Ednan Laperouse, who now mourned the loss of her daughter, went along with the other passengers who didn't get any of what she was going through on board the plane.
"No one knew," she said.
I had sunk my head and tears ran over my cheeks all the time.
It is difficult to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Mourning women hang cards to prevent suicides on bridges
Two women who have lost relatives through a suicide try to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hung up on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and telephone numbers for consulting stations.
Davis's son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and was just 18, when he took suicide.
“I don’t want parents to feel the way I feel every day,” she explained.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, explained that her son had a promising career as a cook and had a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could brighten up a room."
However, he announced his job before his death, since he was “in a really dark place. ”
In 2014, after the suicide, Tyler's body was found by his then 11-year-old brother.
Davis said: 'I always fear that this could have a consequence.'
Davis has designed the cards “to show people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it is a friend.
Don't stay still: you need to talk about it."
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she was together for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt down or depressed," she said.
“A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day he was at the low point. When the children unpacked their gifts, he did not see them in the eyes or anything."
She said that his death was a great trauma to them, but that it had to go through: “It rips a huge hole into the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we must all carry on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future in silence while the FBI starts investigating
'I thought that if we could actually get something like this when he asked for a temporary and limited investigation, maybe we could get a little attention," said Flake on Saturday.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want to investigate the FBI?
Your reluctance can only be traced back to the timing.
The middle elections on November 6 are only five weeks away. If Republicans cut down badly as expected, they would be significantly weakened in their attempts to choose their husband in the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush grabbed the phone listener to call Senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh. He had worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI reports?
There is a vote in the Senate in which 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can unite at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice-President, to vote on equality of votes, and to confirm him before the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean overflows ‘sinkt’ under Kim
The number of North Korean invaders to South Korea has fallen seven years ago, as a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-suck, which refers to data from the South Korean Ministry of Reunification, stated that 1127 invaders were registered last year, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park called stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher prices of human smugglers as the main factors.
Pjongång did not make a public statement.
The vast majority of survivors from the North are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul states that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, over 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most flee across China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China considers the invaders to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often leads them back with violence.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the two heads of state met in Pjøngång for talks that focused on the negotiations on denukularization.
This was followed by the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, where they agreed to work on a de-nucleated Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the American sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without being able to trust the United States, we have no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to disarm ourselves first unilaterally," said Mir Ri in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says that he is not suitable for office at the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the Nancy Pelosi House called Judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterically" and said that he was not suitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I could not deny the impression that a woman who had acted in this way had been called "hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate's Committee on Justice on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denounced all accusations in an emotional way that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
During his opening speech Kavanaugh was very emotional. Sometimes he screamed almost and stood in tears just before when he spoke of his family and his high-school time.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the Committee and called the accusations against him a "great and coordinated assassination" organized by liberals, who were angry at Hillary Clinton's lost presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not serve at the Supreme Court, as they showed that he was biased towards Democrats.
"I believe that he has himself declared himself unfit by these statements and by the way he came down over the Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to destroy Kavanaugh of the Office, he should be confirmed and the Democrats should win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say so much: if he does not tell the Congress or the FBI the truth, then he is not only unsuitable for the Supreme Court, but also for his current judge's office," says Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently judge at the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi continued to say that as a democrat, she was concerned about possible Kavanaughs' decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion principle decision Roe v. Wade, since he was valued as a conservative judge.
In his hearings Kavanaugh turned out questions as to whether he would revise certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“We don’t need a hysterical, prejudiced person who goes to this court and expects us to say, ‘Ah, this isn’t wonderful’,” says Pelosi.
Women must use it as a weapon.
It's a sincere hate speech, months and years of overwhelming anger and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's rare, do you?"
She continued: “I was helped a lot by a woman who was a manager somewhere and said that she too was crying when she gets angry but developed a technique. If she gets angry and starts to cry, tell the person she said to: “You may think that she is sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
And then they just keep talking.
I found this ingenious."
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is of a former job, in a man-dominated office, where one day I cried because of an indescribable rage and by an older woman, an undercooled manager, before whom I was always a little afraid, packed on the collar and pulled into a stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"You don't know you're a stinky bastard.
They believe that you are sad and will be satisfied because they believe you have gone to the substance."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidates.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on board a ship named Monkey Business in an extramarital affair and then withdrew his candidacy, the deeply frustrated Schroeder considered that there was no reason not to consider the idea of the presidential candidate himself.
"It wasn't a well thought-out decision," she told me 30 years later with a laugh.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Since the election campaign had already advanced, it was at the back of the fund-raising campaign, and it vowed not to compete if it was not to get two million dollars together.
It was a hopeless fight.
She found out that some of her supporters who donated men $1,000 supported their campaign with only $250.
"Do they believe I'm getting a discount?" she asked.
In the speech she announced not to launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration about the system that made it so difficult for the voters instead of the delegates, and the anger over sexism, that she was so close to tears.
"One could have assumed that I was experiencing a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
“One could have believed that the handkerchief manufacturer Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember asking myself what they'd probably write on my gravestone.
"She cried"?
Why Beijing could benefit from the trade war between the US and China
The opening ointments of the trade war between the US and China were deafening. Although the battle is not over for a long time, Beijing could benefit from a long-term digging between the countries, my experts.
Donald Trump, U.S. president, fired the first warning at the beginning of the year when he used criminal tariffs to carry out important Chinese export goods, including solar cells, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new criminal tariffs on goods worth 200 billion dollars, effectively affecting half of all goods imported from China into the USA.
Every time Beijing struck back in the same way, and recently, it imposed fines of five to ten percent on American goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China vowed to respond to any US action and it is unlikely that the second largest economic power in the world will soon stumble.
Moving Washington to slow down would mean giving in. However, a public knock on the United States would be far too flattering for China’s President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts believe that if Beijing plays out its cards well, China can benefit from the effects of the trade war in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision could either create the conditions for economic turbulence in both countries in Washington or Beijing is actually much more dangerous than many observers have known before," says Abigail Grace, a scientific assistant who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria was 'ready' for the return of refugees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help for the reconstruction of the country devastated by the war lasting for more than seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that the circumstances in the country are improving.
"Today, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer," he said.
The government is rebuilding the areas destroyed by terrorists to reverse normality.
All conditions were now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, which they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that had their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government welcomes assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance from countries that had supported the uprising.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the Ryder Cup 2018 and defeated Team USA at the Le Golf National near Paris with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the US.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems with most of the tournament, sank his exit on the 16th track (Par 3) in the water and lost to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all its rounds and became one of 4 players who scored a 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was hit 5:4 by the player with the lowest ranking in the team Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The player with the world's best ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 against the Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Sergio Garcia, veteran from eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player ever with 25.5 career points.
“Normally I don’t cry, but today I couldn’t hold back.
It was a difficult year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so infinitely happy to win the Cup back.
It's about the team and I'm happy to have made a contribution," says emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passed on the torch to his compatriot John Rahm, who won the solo encounters against the American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday 2:1.
I'm so incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods I've been watching since my childhood on television," says 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all his four games in France and now has a Ryder Cup balance of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the biggest players of all time who won 14 important titles and is surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
The team USA had all weekend problems to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who performed high-quality performances throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Fury said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I am proud of the boys, they have fought.
There was a time this morning when we put Europe under pressure.
We didn't do anything about it.
Take off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players performed well.
We'll regroup, I'll talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup committee and we'll look forward.
I love those 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to pull the hat.
We were defeated."
