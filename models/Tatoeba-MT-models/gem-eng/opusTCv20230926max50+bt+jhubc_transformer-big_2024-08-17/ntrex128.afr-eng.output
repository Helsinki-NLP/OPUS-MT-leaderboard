Members of the Walloon Assembly worried they're going to "look as sweet"
There is consternation among some meeting members about the proposal that they should change their title from AMs to MWPs (for Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was caused by plans to change the name of the meeting to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of across the political spectrum are afraid that it might provoke a mockery.
One member of the Labour Party said his group was concerned because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Wallies, twp means stupid and pwp means feces.
A meeting member of the Plaid Cymru party said the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternative ones.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party says his group is "absorbent" about the name change, but noted that it is a short leap from MWP to Muppet, the British equivalent of soot or fool.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced like the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter you.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptions of what are called Assembly members will, of course, be a matter for the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultation on the proposals that received ample support to call the meeting a Walloon Parliament.
As for the AM's title, the Commission has elected Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP option has received the most approval in a consultation with the public.
AMs seem to be proposing alternatives, but the fight to get consensus can be a headache for the chairman, Elin Jones, who needs to present a bill on the changes within weeks.
The legislation on the reforms will also include other changes to the functioning of the meeting, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AMs will get the last say in the question of what to call them when discussing the legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum on change of country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia."
The referendum was arranged in an attempt to remove a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has been insisting for some time that the name of its neighbour in the north represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly capsized against its applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of Saint Martin's are silent because churches in Harlem are fooling
"Historically speaking, the old people I spoke to said there was a bar and a church at every corner," Mr. Adams said.
"None of the two are there today."
He says that the disappearance of crows is understandable.
"People are socializing these days in other ways," he says.
"Croatia is no longer the neighborhood's family rooms where people go regularly."
As for churches, he is concerned that the money from asset sales will not last as long as leaders expect, "and sooner or later they are back exactly where they started."
Churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums full of the type of people who will not help the neighborhood's remaining refuges.
"The vast majority of people who buy units in these buildings will be white," he says, "and will therefore bring even closer to the day these churches completely close, because most of the people who enter these condominiums will probably not become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, Saint Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved away in the 1930s.
A black congregation that worshiped there took over the building's title.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Honorary John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers in 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, which did not want to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's members made plans to rebuild it, they ordered the carillon.
Honorable David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the poor people's bells."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it is the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What has been played at St. Martin's in recent months is a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lay leaders of the church, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The church council, the church's governing body, made up of lay leaders - wrote to the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese "will try to transfer the cost" to the church council, even though the church council was not involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some congregation members complain about a lack of transparency from the bishop's side.
Shark injured 13-year-old on lobster dive in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he dived for lobster on the first day of the California lobster season, officials say.
The attack took place shortly before 7am near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then rowing with a group closer to help him pull out of the water.
Hammel says he first thought it was just the excitement of a first lobster catch, but then he realized "that he's calling, 'I'm bitten!
I've been bitten!"
His whole clenched leg was torn open," Hammel saw when he came out to the boy.
"I called for everyone to come out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is described as critical.
It is not known which shark species is responsible for the attack.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said at a media briefing session that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of his upper body.
Officials closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety reasons.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plan to expand to UK beauty market
Sainsbury's tells Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams the battle with department store-type beauty walks staffed by specialist assistants.
As part of a major expansion into the UK's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as fashion and homeware sales slow down, the larger beauty corridors will be tested in 11 stores across the country and if successful, will be taken to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty takes place while supermarkets are looking for ways to fill shelves once used for TVs, microwaves, and homeware.
Sainsbury's says it will double the size of its available beauty products to 3,000 products, which will include trade names such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with brand-specific areas similar to those seen in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also relaunchs its Boutique grimacing range so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly - something that more and more younger buyers are insisting on.
In addition, the perfume retailer, The Fragrance Shop, will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London, and a second that will open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Internet shopping and a move to smaller amounts of food purchased daily at local convenience stores means supermarkets need to do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, chief executive officer of Sainsbury's, said the stores are going to look more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight back against the Aldi and Lidl outlets with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and also introduced a number of Habitat outlets since it bought both these chains two years ago, which according to their grocery sales strengthened and made the purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after an argument about how to divide profits from the pharmacies within its stores.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold his 281-store pharmacy business for <0xC2><0xA3>125m to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain three years ago.
It says Lloyds will play a role in the plan by offering an extensive range of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's trading director, said: "We have transformed the appearance and feel of our beauty walks to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of trade names is designed to cater to every need and the enticing environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a demanding beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'worst' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones ran away "infuriatingly" after TV provider Holly Willoughby pulled her off a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their homewear-and-accessibility brand, Truly.
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trade name.
This Morning, 37, announced on Instagram that she was withdrawing.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones furious by withdrawing from their profitable lifestyle brand business at the last minute - to focus on her own giant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Bronne says Jones was "urgent" when TV's golden girl on Tuesday at a tense meeting in the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, announced that her new opportunities - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - mean she can't spend enough time on their home clothes and accessories trade name, Truly.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trade name and, according to insiders, Willoughby's estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune would have doubled.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones climbed on a beam and traded Britain for one of his vacation homes.
A source says: "Truly was Holly's top priority by far.
It would be her long-term future that would carry her through the next few decades.
Her decision to remove her completely stunned all those involved.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow headquarters that's right to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the This Morning provider, one of Britain's stars that allows the most money to flow in, could drive the firm millions out of pocket due to the icy investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and home clothes, and the possibility that its launch could face even more delays.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin, have been following Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby set up Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple are on vacation together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become a trademark ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the provider of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business affairs."
Hard words "and then we fall in love"
He ridiculed criticism he's going to get from the news media because he made a comment that some would consider "unpresidential" and because he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his kamma-"newsreader vote."
"I didn't give up anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But negotiations on nuclear disarmament are on fire.
North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, more than three months after the June leaders' meeting in Singapore, that the North does not see a "consistent response" from the U.S. to North Korea's early disarmament activities.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining the pressure.
Trump has taken a much more optimistic stance in his meeting speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were about to start a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have this wonderful relationship."
He says his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results - ending rocket tests, helping to free hostages, and causing the rest of American soldiers to be brought home.
And he defended his unusual approach to descriptions of relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have had almost 200 people just standing there," Trump said as he pointed to the crowd right in front of him.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia destroyed the island, killing hundreds of people.
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were said not to be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been uprooted, no national disaster has been announced, a pre-requisite to catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they were very clear that they were not asking for international help, which makes it a little difficult," Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children are working together to travel to Palu, it is not certain if foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
Given the ongoing earthquake in Indonesia, the country remains sadly poorly prepared for the wrath of nature.
While tsunamis were built in Aceh, they are not a common sight to other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life, even if it was a warning of power.
It is at its best challenging to travel between Indonesia's numerous islands.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesia's sophisticated infrastructure a focal point of his election campaign and is issuing money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration is being teased by funding shortages as he faces re-election next year.
Mr. Joko also faces the pressure of sloshing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands of displaced people such as Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with caps, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge kicks good equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute.
Xherdan Shaqiri gave up for Sturridge when he was about 30 years away from the Chelsea goal and his team 1-0 behind.
He hit the ball to the left before kicking it far to the finish line.
The attempt sailed high over the window as it floated to the top right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball tumbled over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and in the net case.
"It was just trying to get into that position, to get on the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible for myself," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and ticked once and didn't think too much about it and just shoved."
Chelsea were 1-0 by halftime after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues' goaltender played Mateo Kovacic again in that playroom with a back-up head before he pitched near the midfield and inked in the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly received and filed in the middle field.
With a beautiful forward head, he then introduced Hazard to the window.
Hazard crossed the defense and ended up with a left-footed kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the farthest goal net.
Liverpool will compete against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday at 3 a.m.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 a.m. in London.
Death toll rises to 832 after Indonesian tsunami
The death toll in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said early on Sunday.
It has been reported that many people have been trapped under the rubble of buildings that have collapsed by a magnitude of 7.5 on Friday, causing fires of up to 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with its more than 380,000 people, was littered with the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest man, 32, on suspicion of murder after woman is stabbed to death
A murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found messed up at 7.55 B.C. in Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area who have heard or seen anything, to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage but I appeal to anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspiciously, to contact us.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught anything on dashcam footage, to contact us as they may have information that may be indispensable to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a Birkenhead resident and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman at the scene came up to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations continue as police said they were in the process of informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to return to his apartment but was told by the police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now told it will take hours before they are allowed back in.
A police officer told one man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears on the scene.
She said repeatedly, "It's so bad."
At 2 nm there were two police cars inside the cordon with another car just outside.
A number of officers were left inside the cordon to monitor the block apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to call @MerPolCC DM, 101 or to call Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 with log 247 of 30 September as reference.
Parliament's Cromwell Statute Becomes Latest Commemoration with 'Rewriting History' Disputes
His banishment will be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's proposal as "suddenness" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statutes that Oliver Cromwell's figure would become a target outside the Palace of Westminster.
The image storm of the English Civil Wars was ordered by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's manipulative portrayal of Cromwell is evidence of 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe is still memorable.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation is the subject of continued historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century gave shape to the later development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that separation.
His success as a protector is also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
The Chinese Farmers' Farmers' Farmers' Farmers' Farmers' Farmers' Farmers' Farmers' Farmers' Farmers' Farmers' Farmers' Farmers' Farmers' Farmers' Farm
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his of, "Yuan", was found dead with a torn butcher covered with blood near a loft at the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer prepares to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found a door open to a neighboring porcupine.
He said there was a large male pig in the cage with blood on his mouth.
A forensic investigation has confirmed that the 550-pound pig bitten the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bloodied and torn," said the cousin, who was named on his behalf, "Wu," according to the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4.40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man does not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening New that the pig was locked in to prevent it from attacking someone else, while police gathered evidence on the scene.
Yuan's family and the market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Strange, though, are cases of pigs that people attack before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig caught a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife deterred the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBS News that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "faster."
"They're not playing.
They're cocks, very curious... they're not out to hurt you.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
Res of Hurricane Rosa will bring widespread heavy rain to southwestern U.S.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves across the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring floods across northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. over the coming days.
Rosa had winds from 85 m.p.u., a Category 1 hurricane, on Sunday from 5 a.m. eastward, and was placed 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough over the Pacific Ocean begins to take shape and move eastward to the west coast of the US. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it will begin to propel heavy tropical humidity northward into the southwestern US.
Rosa will bring rain of up to 10 inches in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, in response to the approaching trough, tropical humidity will bring widespread heavy rainfall to the southwest over the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous kits floods, waste streams, and possibly landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause place-place rainfall rates of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially over the largest parts of Arizona.
Kits floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the widespread nature of tropical rain.
It will be extremely unwise to venture into the desert on foot with the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain can cause deep clumps to hit raging rivers and thunderstorms will bring heavy local winds and dust clouds.
The approaching trough will bring a little local heavy rain to parts of the Southern California coastline.
Rainfall total figures of more than half a inch are possible, which can cause low waste flow and smooth lanes.
This will be the region's first rainfall of the wet season.
A few scattered tropical rainbows will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday before the rains late Monday and Tuesday become more widespread.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
October can see intense temperature fluctuations across the U.S. as the North Pole cools, but the tropics remain very hot.
This sometimes leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature differences across the central U.S. is on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, numerous summer heats will try to rise and expand again.
It is expected that large parts of the central and eastern U.S. will start hot October, with widespread 80s from the Southern Low Plains to parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a higher chance of averaging temperatures for the eastern U.S. for the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watch Brett Kavanaugh's trial
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched television on six television networks the gripping testimony of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christian Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programs for Friday's on-the-nipper turn: an agreement made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was betaing her in drunkenness and was trying to pull her clothes out at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a heartfelt testimony, said he's 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It's likely that more than 20.4 million people watched it on Friday, Nielsen reported.
The company has averaged viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures were not immediately available to other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen sometimes finds it difficult to meet people who look in offices.
To put it in perspective, it's an audience as big as one for a decisive football match or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts Kavanaugh's appointment strongly supported, was ahead of all the networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day's long interrogation, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest was still high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he was going to vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was jailed Friday morning on CNN and CBS where guards shouted at him as he tried to take a hysteria to a judicial committee.
He stood with his eyes closed for a few minutes while CNN was vividly visualizing how he was being slapped.
"I'm right here in front of you," one woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the truth?
It was said to him, "You have power while so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office issued a statement and went in front of the elevator door, saying he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting networks all covered later live hours when the Judicial Committee would vote to promote Kavanaugh's appointment to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI will look at the allegations against the candidate for the next week, as requested by the Democratic minority.
Flake is partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democrat Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK EM May accuses critics of ‘political game’ over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "political play" with Britain's future and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview alongside her on the front page of the paper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued with his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU should incur each other's tariffs was "totally ridiculous."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
Police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the riot.
Police found the glasses on the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, reports CBS-affiliated WAFB.
After interviewing Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
East Baton Rouge Parish's judicial mortuary office issued a preliminary report on Friday saying that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head at the neck.
The department praises the Louisiana State Police's premeditated task force, the state police's crime laboratory, Southern University police, and area citizens for their help with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked area law enforcement for his "excessive and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot-six forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
His average previous season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
LSU basketball referee Will Wade said the team was "flattened" and "in shock" about Wayde's death.
"That's what you're worried about," Wayde said.
The volcano is located in Mexico City.
As spewed from the Popocatepeti volcano, the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital have reached.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity picked up in the crater and registered 183 releases of gas and ashes over 24 hours.
The center has monitored multiple turns and shakes.
Images on social media have shown how thin low-gas motor windscreens near Mexico City such as Xochimilco are covered.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in activity at the volcano, which sits 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo," has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists for commemoration of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and thousands joined anti-government protests to commemorate the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote for abdication.
A group of masked pro-separatists held back by riot police, they bribed with eggs and threw powder paint that caused dark dust clouds in streets usually teeming with tourists.
A police station also broke out later in the day and police had to use their clubs to keep the bakery in check.
Over several hours, pro-independence groups sang in one tone "No Forget, No Forgiveness" in confrontation with the unionists' cry of "Long Live Spain".
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries sustained in the parades, the local press reported.
The tension continues to run high in the independence-minded region a year after the October 1 referendum by Madrid was considered illegal but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly voted to become independent but participation was low, with those opposed to abdication who largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted in violent clashes to prevent the vote from continuing at the polling stations across the region.
Pro-independence groups camped on Friday night to prevent a protest in support of the national police.
The protest continued but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist demonstration with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful for the prospect of Catalonia gaining independence.
"Last year we had one of the best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy because they could vote but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite a life-important but navel-crazy victory in regional elections last December, Catalonian pro-independence parties have struggled this year to maintain momentum, with many of their best-known leaders either in self-imposed exile or in custody for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who took up the protest in support of the police on his phone, says the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced that he will be in European Parliament elections next year.
"To stand as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to disapprove of the decline in democratic values and the oppression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after motoring against house vasry
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after a car repeatedly slashed against a house in Londonderry.
The incident unfolded Thursday at about 19:30 BST in Ballynagardsingel.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the gates and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been shot at a stage after the car.
Menga goal gives Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secures victory
Promoted Livigston stunned Rangers to transfer Steven Gerrard to only his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was to prove the difference when Gary Holt's team moved to second with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team stayed in the Premiership this season without a win-away and will face the forerunners Heart next week, which is their eight points ahead.
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europaliga on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extends their unbeaten run in the division to six games, with head coach Holt still not making a defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston lost chances against bot visitors
Holt's team had to run ahead long before they scored a goal, with their round-the-clock busting that brought Rangers all sorts of problems to the neck.
SR broke through, but acted in front of the goalkeeper, then AL could only play wide after he got closer and CH's head held across the goalkeeper.
The hosts were pleased to have Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could get the visitors with dead-game moments.
And so the decisive goal came.
Rangers set off a free-kick and Livingston created an opportunity, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson giving Menga the chance to kick and score a goal from the middle of the window.
By that time, Rangers had dominated but could not penetrate through home defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely unconcerned.
That pattern continued in the second half, when Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly's return.
Scott Pittman was fired by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow has been widely tapped to escape from Livingston's open game.
Crossings repeatedly reached Livingston's frame and repeatedly turned, while two penalty runs—after Halkett's challenge from substitute Glenn Middleton and one for handball—were dismissed.
‘Fenomenal’ by Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
It's a great game and game for Livingston.
Until the last man was excellent; they still exceeded expectations on this upward trajectory.
Their style of play and crew have remained almost unchanged since their return to first-class, but a great deal of honor comes to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hackett was huge with his manipulative defensive rankings while Menga kept on their toes for Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout.
The Rangers were inspired.
As good as they were at times under Gerrard, they could not maintain those standards.
Their final ball was missing and only once they could penetrate the home team, which is somewhat of a wake-up call for Rangers, who are in middle division.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an receives mixed reception in Cologne
Saturday (29 September) there were smiling and blue skies when leaders from Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which had to restore relations between NATO allies.
They have had a fallout on issues that include human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police have cited security reasons to prevent the 25,000-strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters have come to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an protesters – many of them Kurdies – also made their voices thick and condemned both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The fighting protests reflect the division of a visitor greeted by some German Turks as hero and picked out by others as outright.
Deptford road accident: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist died in a collision in London involving a car.
The collision occurred around 10:15 BST near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics were present but the man died on the scene.
The collision comes months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run in Childers Street, about a mile from where Saturday's accident occurred.
The Metropolitan Police said officials were working to identify the man and alert his relatives.
Road closures and bus diversions are in place and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Guardians in Rebel Injured
Six custodians were injured in an insurgency at a high-security male prison, the prison office said.
Rebellion broke out on Sunday at about 9:30 a.m. BST and is still underway at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.
Specialist "Tornado guards" were called to deal with the insurgent, which includes eight prisoners and is limited to one wing.
The guards were treated at the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to pay attention to a continued incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and can stay behind bars for longer."
HMP Long Martin houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the chief of the prison received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot officials were called to pay attention to serious disorder in which staff with billiard balls were attacked.
Hurricane Pink Threat Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Kitsfloods (Dry areas Trek perhaps Advantage)
It's unusual for a tropical low pressure to hit Arizona but it's exactly what can happen early next week as Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy moves across the southwestern desert and brings kits flood risks.
The National Weather Service has already issued tick flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will take a direct route across Phoenix on Tuesday, and will be approaching with rain by Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status since 1950 within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The National Hurricane Center's models predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the U.S. Southwest, including the Central Rockies and the Great Come, are likely to get 1 to 2 inches, with isolated totals of possible up to 4 inches.
For those out of kits flood risk, Rosa's rain is likely to be a blessing as the region is plagued by drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, this rainfall is likely to be beneficial as the Southwest is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, only about 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least extreme drought, the second highest category," weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path leads to the approach of land across the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still at hurricane strength Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is coming against cooler water in the Pacific Ocean and that's why its power is decreasing.
It is therefore expected to reach the country on Monday in the afternoon or evening against tropical storm forces in Mexico.
Rainfall across parts of Mexico can be severe and pose a significant flood risk.
"Rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north over Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours as a tropical depression and will then move through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
"The greatest danger expected of Rosa is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the U.S. Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said.
It is expected that these rains can cause life-threatening kit floods and debris flows in the deserts and landslides in the mountainous areas.
Midsummer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys, a 20-year-old man, were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The injured teenage son was found on Saturday at around 04:00 BST in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to hospital where he was still in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officials have appealed to anyone who may have any cell phone footage of what happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh "has suffered under the commonality, the anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "has suffered from the commonality, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday and fervently and emotionally denied a claim by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearing about her claim.
The president said on Saturday that the Americans saw that day "the brilliance and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most capable legal spirits of our time, a judiciary with a pure record of public service," he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican rise at the midterm elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
"I'm not standing, but I'm standing," he said.
That's why I'm running for this candidate."
Trump has said the Democrats are on a mission to "resist and obstruct."
The first important procedural vote on the Senate floor over Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership assistant told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths due to Indonesian shooting, tsunami, with numbers still rising
At least 384 people were killed and many washed away when huge waves broke on beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday in the city of Palu on the beach for a party on the beach when surfers from up to six meters (18 feet) high at sunset on the beach, washed away many after their death and destroyed everything that was in the way.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and did not immediately run and they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief agency BNPB during an information session in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come on its own, it dragged cars, stumps, houses together, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved across the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed into trees to free the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Air photos released by the disaster agency show numerous buildings and shops that have been destroyed, bridges that have been wrecked and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, they shot the coast.
A series of earthquakes is felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's agency for the evaluation and application of technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's giant shooting was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which sits at the tip of a long, narrow bay, could have exacerbated the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant," saying thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
Bodies of some victims were found where they were trapped under the rubble of buildings that collapsed, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the accidents and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala that is closer to the earthquake hazard.
Communication "is completely hampered with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a disaster, but it can get a lot worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting that a tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the waves came at the time of the warning.
In amateur imagery shared on social media, it can be heard how a man on the top floor of a building is screaming desperate warnings about the upcoming tsunami to the people below in the street.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the beach and demolishes buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't immediately explain the footage.
The quake and tsunami caused major power outages that cut off communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but investigators still needed food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has only been reopened for assistance attempts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will be visiting evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia-Tsoenami death toll rises above 800.
This is very bad.
Although World Vision's Donggala staff arrived safely in Palu city where workers were hiding in shelters erected in their office's courtyard, they bypassed on their way to scenes of devastation, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
This is very bad.
Even as aid groups begin the ghastly task of putting the disaster relief task in motion, some people complained that foreign aid workers are being prevented from travelling to Palu with much experience.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funds, supplies and personnel from overseas can only get underway after the area of the disaster has been declared a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, 'Good, it's a national disaster,' we can open it to international assistance, but it doesn't have a status yet."
With the arrival of the second night on Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing are hopeful that their loved ones will be the miracles that will bring relief to the sad storyline of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of a sewer pipe.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman for two days under rubble, with her mother's body stuck next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national parachute weaver team, has coached two of the missing parachute weavers for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Still among those who were arrested at the Roa Roa Hotel, Mr. Monday included, were his students.
"As a senior in the parachute field, I have my own emotional load," he said.
Mr. Gendon tells how, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated on social media under the parachute web community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who participated in the beach party.
His messages, however, were only answered with one gray right mark, instead of two blue right marks.
"I don't think that means the message isn't delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during replenishment of OTM at Newport on the Levee
The thieves stole Friday morning $26,750 from a Brink's worker who refilled an ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Station news release.
The car's driver was emptying an OTM in an entertainment complex and getting ready to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man "came running from behind the Brink's employee" and stole the bag of money that had to be delivered.
According to the release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing from the scene, but police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is going to change his name – after Ye
With the announcement of the change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: "The being formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live where he is expected to introduce his new ally Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande on the program that canceled for "emotional reasons," the program's manufacturer said.
Apart from being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said in the past that the word has religious significance for him.
"I believe 'you' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year when discussing his album title with radio provider Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – just the reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
He is one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs was previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West employee, JAY-Z, has also finished with or without a couple characters and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexican newly elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised in the run-up to the country's 50th anniversary of a bloody retribution against students never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use the army to harass the Mexican people."
Soldiers shot at a peaceful demonstration in the plaza on October 2, 1968, where up to 300 people were killed at a time when left-wing student movements throughout Latin America were posing.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and a lack of training opportunities are attracting the youth to gangs.
The U.S. needs to double its funding
With China becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in that field, investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft, and Apple, said.
The comments come after several parts of the U.S. government made AI announcements, even recently the U.S. made an overall formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, last year China announced their plan: they aim to be the No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Double the AI research budget will be a good start given that all the other countries are so far behind the U.S. and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI," Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances that the next major AI performance will be achieved in the U.S., Lee said in an interview to CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the HUB of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-rated American Othello player and later became a management officer at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee has given credit to previous technology competitions of the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotics challenge and asked when the next one will be, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government seats, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes away the academic leaders; it's the corporate laws," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have appointed influential people from other universities to work on AI.
Lee says immigration policy changes can also help to aid the U.S.'s AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhDs in AI," he said.
China's State Council issued its next generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint center for artificial intelligence aimed at involving partners from the industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence last month came under fire.
Macedonians vote in elections or country's name needs to change
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change their name to "Republic of North Macedonia", action that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that blocked its membership bots for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that their northern neighbor's name represents a claim in the area and has refused their admission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments entered into an agreement in June, based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents reasoned that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign doubted whether the turnout would meet the minimum 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot read: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have argued that it is a price that can be paid to pursue admission to Macedonia, one of the countries created from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough MPs have said they will accept the outcome of the vote to decide it.
The name change will require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state's election commission said there were no reports of invulnerability by 1 nm.
But the turnout was then only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's EM, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko cast their votes for the referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name that will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, 30 September 2018.
Before the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small increase and drew up chairs in front of tents set up by those who are going to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favour of it, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he cast his vote.
He said a "yes" result would be "confirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by Macedonia’s Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum – less than the required amount.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote.
For the referendum to be successful, the turnout should be 50 percent plus one vote.
A setback in the referendum will be the first serious setback for the policy of a pro-Western government since the government took over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigates throughout Brighton defense for goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling removed the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy during his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine goalkeeper received a tie at the beginning of the series at the midfield.
He drove through three Brighton defenders before hitting the open field.
Aguero is surrounded by four green shirts.
He overthrew one defender before passing several others on the edge of the Brighton goaltender.
He then pushed a duck to the left, where he found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the cage to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a kick to the right of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with problems with his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told journalists.
"We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
This is what happened.
We're glad he scored a goal at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League match.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep in the Brighton area.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane had a few touches before leading Sterling to the farthest goal corner.
The Sky Blues frontman kicked the ball in the net just before he was over the back line.
City tackle Hoffenheim in Championenliga Tuesday at 12:55 pm at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play against Rockies
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there's not much reason to force another start.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer wants to attack the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still playoffs for the Rockies, which have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies scored at least a promotion pick with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday night, but still want to capture their first division title.
"Although we're not playing for nothing, we can at least play the game knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowds and the other team is likely to play at the highest level of any point I'm going to face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate?"
The Nationals still have to announce their starting player for Sunday, but are reportedly favorable for allowing Scherzer to throw in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will have his 34th start, had a throwing exercise on Thursday and will play on his normal rest-Sunday.
The Washington right-handed are 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 outtakes in 220 2/3 turns this season.
Trump holds a meeting in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court elector Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican rise in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lifetime.
It’s one of the big, big – I’m not standing, but I’m actually standing, and that’s why I’m fighting everywhere for these candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, "One sees this ailing, ailing radical group of Democrats, one sees it happening now.
And they are now determined to take back the power by using any possible way, one sees the community, the genius.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to walk over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and strength, we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "resist and hinder."
"And one sees it over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "evil and common and genocidal and false."
He referred to the name of Senate's judicial committee's high-ranking Dianne Feinstein, who received loud messages from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?"
Did you read the document?
- Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting one — it was really weak body language — the weakest body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a church.
It's intolerable to those who say what they think
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to put me under censorship, it wasn't exactly a surprise.
After all, I'm the last person in a string of Labour Party LPs to be told we're not welcome – all because we said what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatments because she stood up fearlessly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censorship criticized me because I differed from Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically enough similar issues that Jeremy differed from previous leaders.
The announcement for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as the local Labor Party LP, it was exactly what Friday morning's AR meetings were.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings today and the promise of "more friendly, more benign" politics has long been forgotten, if it ever began.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated within the Labour Party and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party's leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I thought I had previously shared similar political views, began to expect me to take a U-turn and take positions that I would never have otherwise agreed with – either on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public – and it doesn’t really matter what I’m saying – there’s a tirade of shell language on social media asking me not to be re-elected, rejecting politics from the core, and telling me not to be in the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
I'm actually happier than my colleagues because the comments directed at me tend to be political.
I have a lot of respect for professionalism and determination for those colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults every day, but never shy away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult have normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party must cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every "motion of distrust" or change of celibacy rules, the party becomes narrower.
I've had a lot of advice over the past two years that encourages me to stay under the radar, not be so outspoken and that then I'll be "weekly."
But I didn't go into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a schoolgirl 32 years ago, spurred by the Thatcher government’s neglect that literally left my high school run down, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most – whether as a local councilor or government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, including at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been at all confused about my policy positions and areas where I differ from the current leadership.
To those who presided over the motion on Friday, I can only say that with the country sending on a Brexit that will harm all households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the one message I actually have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my constituents, whether their now members of the Labour Party are or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats of not being re-elected or political advantage will keep me from doing what I believe is in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unwonne Ayr bo
Two late threes may have skewed the final score slightly, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderfully entertaining Tennent's Premiership match of the day.
They are now at the top of the scorer, the only unbeaten team of the ten.
In the end, it was their excellent defense, as well as their better chances, that carried the home team and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be satisfied.
"We've been tested so far in our games and we're still unbeaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Honor to Ayr, they took their chances better than we have."
Grant Anderson's three in the 14th minute, which was targeted by Frazier Climo, made Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scotland player Rory Hughes, made available for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to count the numbers and Jason Baggot recorded an unintended three.
Climo increased Ayr's lead with a penalty head, just in front of him, just before Rustyd meant a solo three to make it 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's three, meant by Baggot, reduced the backlash to five points.
There was a long delay for a serious injury at Ruaridh Knott worn on a wearable, and from the restart, Ayr increased the lead with a Stafford McDowall three, targeted by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card and once again Melrose took advantage of the extra player with an unintended three by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a very busy game.
The home team made a return and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he killed Climo without the ball, and from the penalty line, MacPherson pushed the ball to death behind the upcoming Ayr draw.
Climo meant it, as he also did almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe got David Armstrong's head and flank sent Gregor Henry away for the home team's fifth three.
Still Game-Star looks like he's going to take on a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star seems to be moving to the hospitality industry after it was discovered that he was named director of a company of licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and plays in with old comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the show's last, and it looks like Kiernan is preparing for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor didn't want to comment, although a source at the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wants to get involved in Glasgow's "floating restaurant industry."
'The sea is ours': land-dwelling Bolivia hope court will reopen to Pacific Ocean
Marine patrolling a masonry-covered fleet quarters in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a sea blue flag.
Fleet bases from Titicaca Lake to the Amazon are covered with the slogan: "The sea is really ours.
It's a duty to get it back."
Throughout the rural Bolivia, the memory of the coastline that they lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still fresh – as well as the need to re-capture the Pacific Ocean.
That hope is probably the highest it has been in decades, while Bolivia is waiting for a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1, after 5 years of talks.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and obviously expects the outcome with a positive attitude," Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat, said in a statement.
Many Bolivians will look at the IGH ruling on large screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will find in favor of Bolivia’s claim that – after decades of sporadic negotiations – Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president – who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year – also faces many who depend on Monday’s ruling.
"We're close to returning to the Pacific," he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in Bolivia’s favor – and that little will change if it does.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to grant Chilean territory, and has suggested that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the IRH's ruling comes just six months after the last, shows that the case "was not complicated," says Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than helping Bolivia's cause, the past four years may have slowed it down.
"The issue of access to the sea was hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has tapped any remaining Chilean benevolence, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to conduct subsequent talks.
The two countries exchanged last ambassadors in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was extremely rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relationships with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of differences with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't come unless its U.S. can trust it.
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his country would never first disarm its nuclear weapons if they couldn't trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during a Singapore summit between the competing countries' leaders.
His remarks following U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are apparently on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy, which has reached a dead end, more than three months after the Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "dream picture" that continued sanctions and U.S. capping to a statement that ended the Korean War will also bring the North to its knees.
Washington is cautious about agreeing to the statement without Pyongyang taking significant steps to disarm.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about doing away with an arsenal that the country regards as the only way to ensure their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris Fashion Shows Reveal Newest Series of Big Head Covers On The Road To The Shops Near You
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely dislike the sun, you don't have to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have introduced a series of bold oversized headgear at their SS19 collection on the treadmill that captivated the style at Paris Fashionweek.
Extremely impractical guards passed through Instagram this summer and these designers paraded their bewildering creations on the treadmill.
The blinker by Valentino was an oversized beige hat with a feathery wide edge that swallowed the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included watermelons decorated with jewels, a magic hat, and even a pineapple – but it’s not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne has also introduced a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had elaborate lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation looked like scuba gear, with a snorkel and diving goggles included, while another looked like a melted ice cream shornie.
And if you continue the great fashion statement, it's your happy day.
Style watchers predict that the huge guards may be on their way to the shops near you.
The oversized hat follows briefly on the heels of 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-foot wide edge seen on everyone's heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat spread over social has sent another great creation across the board – a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the swimsuit-wearing model it wore.
The burnt orange raffia bag, finished with raffia fringes and finished a white leather handle at the top, stood out at Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Modeweek.
Well-known stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags appearing in stores for next summer – as the designer has made such a big impact that it will be difficult to ignore the request for oversized additional ones."
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a zippered performance of academic excellence, and it continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, which were only reinforced by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other community enterprises.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their position as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a custom school curriculum, we see that world languages continue as a popular and desirable subject choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "When you talk to someone in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It's a powerful reminder that we can't rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's recent exam results, we can see that languages are at the top of the league table with the highest pass rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a higher grade A.
The data, collected from SCIS's 74 member schools, showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher grade A in Mandarins, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 of those who studied French, and 63 of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young adults will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages now, as a subject, have the same status as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools' curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission on Occupations and Skills found in 2014 that of the reasons employees provide why they struggle to fill posts, 17 percent are attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more important to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more likely jobs requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career that someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such a life-long skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically place a multilingual person above the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That's why it's so important to invest in today's children's language education.
Knowing multiple languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of getting meaningful work.
In Scotland, every school will differ in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages will teach which are considered essential for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarins or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teaching staff who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
It cannot be denied at this stage, in a global business environment, that languages are still extremely important for the country's future, and therefore they must be reflected in education.
True, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland's young people.
I'll faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make its debut for the San Diego Lakers on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans to see how LeBron James makes his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
The exact number of minutes he's going to play has yet to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited amount of time.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six games in the preseason program.
"I don't need any pre-season games at this stage in my career to get ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia meeting, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a wave of election meetings in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first of five scheduled contractions in the next week, including stops at friendly locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote currently held for his choice to fill the vacancies in the Supreme Court, Trump intends to build support for the upcoming midterm election because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when voting in November.
What time is Trump's gathering in West Virginia tonight and how do you look online after that?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, was scheduled for 7 a.m. ET tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia via live stream below.
Trump is likely to pay attention to this week's hearings for the High Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, who has been tense about allegations of sexual misconduct with an expected confirmation vote held for up to a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main point of this excess contraction is to help the Republicans facing tough elections in November.
President Trump's campaign, therefore, said these five contractions were aimed at "visiting volunteers and supporters while Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Government over Congress is so critical of his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we reach the busy campaign season," a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who refused to name his name, told Reuters.
Tonight's rally, which was arranged for the Wesbanco arena in Wheeling, can draw supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and can be covered by the media in Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind according to the voting patterns.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a boost at the ballot box," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team shows they have the courage to fight to keep hope alive as they enter Sunday's singles game
After three one-sided sessions, the four-game teams of Saturday afternoon were probably just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging swing of momentum is an overall minded sports concept but one in which players wholeheartedly believe, and certainly in competitions such as these.
Where would they say the momentum is now?
"They went ahead with six points and now it's four, so we're wearing it as a bit of a momentum, I reckon," Jordan Spieth said as he walked away at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points ahead and twelve more to be played.
The Americans, however, feel, as Spieth says, that they have such a little wind in their sails and that there is a lot to encourage them, not least not the class of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each recorded three points out of four.
Spieth was fatal from the top to the bottom of the field and guided by his example.
Those shoe celebrations got tougher as his round progressed and he dropped a critical set to win game four completely at the same time as he and Thomas were after two laps with two behind.
She holds that the game won at 15 for them, was greeted with a similar scream, the kind that tells one that he believes the American team has another chance.
"You really just have to take everything out and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
That's all these players are talking about.
18 pieces to print out their stamp.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's single but charming couple got four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't keep track of job numbers on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided Saturday mornings one about job numbers as well as during the back nine Friday mornings.
That race, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from these exuberant crowds, confirm that they are the players to be beaten on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari who can win a potential European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
Both of them are in different sizes or in different sizes.
It's too early to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly met Sergio Garcia, the morning's four-ball hero, when he played with Alex Noren.
One holds over track number and two doubles on the front nine caused the Spaniard and the Swede to end up in a hole from which they could hardly even come.
On Sunday, there's no one to help you out of your hole.
The four-ball and four-game teams are so exciting to keep close watch because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change at a glance.
Europe has always played better as a team so far and has made significant progress on the last day, but this four-game session has also shown that the U.S. team has the courage for the battle that some, especially at home, have doubted.
Europe runs 10-6 ahead during the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a healthy advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after coming with a 10-6 lead from Saturday's four-ball and four-game games.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their score to four points at Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who tried to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that performed unevenly in the morning's four-balls, so they won the series 3-1.
The U.S. has more resistance area in the four-game and has won two games, but they don't let the backlash shrink.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, who are called "Moliwood" after a sensational weekend, are just the second pair in the history of the Ryder Cup to have scored four points after their first four games.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into the four-balls, they played well together to defeat a dad Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambreau with an even more convincing 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, sometimes showed flashes of brilliance but he now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-ball and four-game and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning's four-balls, came back to play with Henrik Stenson in the four-game to a 2&1 defeat for Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are first and third in the world rankings.
However, on a pleasant day with a windy southwest of Paris, Europe did not always get their sense.
Jordan Spieth, who has won a major tournament three times and Justin Thomas has set the brand for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They recorded a tough 2&1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 3&4 in the four-game after losing the first two putties.
Just twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team recovered from a four-point backlash when they entered the singles game, though Furyk's team only had to play at the same time to keep the trophy because they already hold it.
However, after being second best for two days, it doesn't seem like they're going to get a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says it won't "decid" unilaterally disarm without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions are exacerbating their distrust of the United States and that the country will certainly not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally without such characteristics.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Body's Annual General Assembly that in the past year, North Korea has taken "significant benevolence measures," such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, breaking down the nuclear test site, and promising not to multiply nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We don't see any consistent response from the U.S.," he said.
"Without any trust in the U.S., there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances we will certainly not unilaterally disarm first."
While Ri reiterated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to the removal of nuclear weapons under which North Korea would be rewarded if it took gradual steps, his words seemed meaningful because they did not unconditionally reject unilateral removal of nuclear weapons, as Pjongjang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-Oen and Donald Trump at the very first summit between a president of the United States and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore when Kim undertook to work for the "destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula" while Trump pledged safeguards for North Korea's security.
North Korea wants a formal end to the Korean War from 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted requests for strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. urges the "destruction of nuclear weapons first" and exerts more pressure by tightening the level of sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way, and even objecting to the "declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can force us on our knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are causing us distrust."
Ri said nothing about plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump on which the U.S. leader drew attention to the United Nations earlier this week.
Rather, the minister drew attention to three meetings over the past five months between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in, adding: "If the party in this issue was about the destruction of nuclear weapons South Korea and not the US, the destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korea's rockets would be directed at the U.S. landmass after "Mr. Bose President" Trump called Kim a "fire pillarman" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened last year to "totally destroy North Korea," praised Kim abundantly for his courage for taking steps to disarm, but he said that much work still needs to be done and that sanctions should remain there until North Korea destroys nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a time frame for this, saying "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years, or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps they have taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday to the UN Security Council that: "Applying sanctions by the Security Council must continue diligently and without ceasing until we realize the full, final, confirmed destruction of nuclear weapons."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unilaterally tightened sanctions against North Korea in an effort to dry up funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the outskirts of the UN General Assembly and afterwards said he would visit Pjongjang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip there did not go well.
He left Pjongjang in July and said progress had been made, but North Korea accused him of making "beneficial claims" just hours later.
North Korea, in a meeting with Moon, promised to break down a missile site and also hit a nuclear complex if the United States took "consistent measures."
He said Kim told him that the "consistent measures" he wants to see are security safeguards Trump promised in Singapore as well as steps toward normalization of relationship with Washington.
Harvard students follow a course on enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year allows all of its undergraduate students to get more sleep in an effort to counter the growing macho culture of studying by coffee-driven "whole-day sessions."
An academic has found that students at the world's top university are often innocuous when it comes to the basics of how to look after themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical Faculty and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes to be the first of its kind in the U.S.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of the day, one girl approached me and said, 'Why are they telling me this first, in my senior year?'
She said that no one told her how important sleep was - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was presented for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as how it improves their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical Faculty and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to enter the course after it was found that students were severely deprived of sleep during the week.
The hour-long course involves a few interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a dorm room, where students need to click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise shoes and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation and the importance of a sleep-time routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase risks of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it won't change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know what its health impact is to choose to smoke cigarettes," added Prof Czeisler.
The culture of pride in 'studying all night' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
To make sure you get enough sleep of good quality, a student's "secret weapon" should be to avoid stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid putting on weight, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in a starvation mode, which makes you feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after walking one of his classes during his first year at Harvard last year.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to strive for a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the institution where people compete with each other.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students should consider setting an alarm for when they are going to sleep, as well as when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm and lead to you struggling to touch the sheep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal defeats Gerrard's men
Rangers experienced another sarcastic roadside heartbreak when Dolly Menga's goaltender Steven Gerrard's incoherent team scored a 1-0 defeat.
The Ibrox team wanted to win their first as visitors since February's 4-1 victory at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only gave Gerrard his second defeat in 18 games as a driver so that his team was eight points behind Hearts, which ran loosely in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes ahead of rest, and it didn't seem like a Rangers team would play without much inspiration.
As Rangers now fall to sixth position, Livingston climbs to third and is just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there may be further difficulty for Rangers after border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object appears to have been thrown off the road.
Gerrand made eight changes to the team that stormed past Ayr after the final match of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi-11 that took a point from Hearts last week and he would have been in his noppies with the way his well-trained team smeared their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated ball possession, but Livingston did more when they had the ball.
They actually had to score after just two minutes when Menga's first downing Scott Pittman sent through on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder opened up his big chance.
A deep free-kick by Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett but his defense mate Alan Lithgow could only miss kicking at the back goalpost.
Rangers took control, but it seemed like there was more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt he had to get a penalty goal at the quarter-point when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's requests.
Rangers managed to get only two shots to the target during the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly bothered by Lassana Coulibaly's head shot and a mate's head of goal from Oviedo Ejaria.
While Livi's opener might have been against the game at the 34th minute, no one can deny that they deserved it, even if it's just for their hard work.
Rangers once again didn't handle a deep set of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who stayed coolhead and sent it to Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted at the break when he traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had an almost immediate impact when the wing sent to Morelos but drove the impressive Kelly from his line to the block.
But Livingston has continued to force visitors to play exactly the kind of game they enjoy, with Lithgow and Halkett palming long ball after long ball.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the last stages, but McGregor stood up well to stop Jacobs before Lithgow could enter wide from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another late claim for a penalty kick when he met Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our "Sondaggend" almanac: 30 September 1882, today 136 years ago, and US TEL VERDER... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger has developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has been a pillar of science, and it has also become a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," in which those two unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played:
Man: "What on earth is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you set up these earphones, you can even hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Well, that's about it!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' predator cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' and kill predator cells
Vaccines teach the immune system to identify predator cells as part of treatment
Method involves withdrawing immune cells from a patient, changing them in a laboratory
They can then "see" a protein that is common to many cancers and then inject it again.
A trial drug shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to identify predator cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein found in many cancers called HER2, and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "drives the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, Prof Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and "learning" them how to attack cancer cells has worked to beat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West started a pro-Trump mock speech after acting on SNL, while wearing a MAGA hat.
This didn't go well.
Kanye West was featured in the studio during a Saturday Night Live following a protracted act in which he believed U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would put him on the ballot in 2020.
After singing his third song of the night, which is called Ghost Town and during which he wore a Make America Great-pet, he went out against the Democrats and repeated his support of Trump.
"I talk to a white man so often and they say, 'How can you love Trump, he's a racist?'
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch featuring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star spotted Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's judicial committee on charges of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even if it's not broadcast, the footage of West's chatter was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It's unclear if Rock for West tried to spot it by placing it.
West also complained to the audience that it was made difficult for him behind the stage about what he wore on his head.
"They hit me on the side of the ladder.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat on."
They've ruined me!
And then they say I'm in a low place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West said, "Do you want to see the low place?" and said that he would put on his "supermantle, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments have attracted at least twice a viewership and members of the SNL cast seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there who said to the publication, "The whole studio has become deadlocked."
West was brought in as a late substitute for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the drummer Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West was very surprised with a performance of the song I Love It, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of conservation group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest minds: THANK YOU FOR SPEAKING THE SCREEN."
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "who he is and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") who I believe accepts and proclaims an ideology that puts my community at risk.
He is free.
"We too," she added.
Before the show, the drummer announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he is now "the creature that was formerly known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Co-window, Snoop Dogg, had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, late music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder of a knife in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed with a knife in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.

The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrate's Court on Monday.
The charge will be reviewed by the public prosecution service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, criticized the macho hero's stereotype and said such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel they need to be tough to be respected.
Kit spoke to The Sunday Times Culture and said he believed "something went wrong" and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his co-star from Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he felt "reasonably strong" about making this issue work.
"I personally feel pretty strong about it at the moment - where did we go wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What have our men learned as they grow up in relation to the problem we are seeing now?"
Kit believes that television is quite possibly responsible for the growth in toxic masculinity due to its extremely male characters.
He continued, "What is inborn and what is taught?
What is being taught on TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel like they should have this certain aspect of being a man?
I think this is really one of the big questions in our time - how do we change it?
"Something went wrong with our young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not participate in any of the Game of Thrones sequels and sequels when the series comes to an end next summer, for he says he is "ready with battlefields and horses."
From November, Kit will play in a new version of Sam Shephard's True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thought the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones was to meet his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife on this program, so it gave me my future family, and my life from here on out," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married on the grounds of Leslie's family estate in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced that there is a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country are affected, according to health officials.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted by sex, which represents a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly through some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, the number of people living in China with HIV and AIDS rose by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is a critical issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very common.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, China's government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to make the case work.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked GOP senators' data, condemning "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters on Saturday filed allegations that a member of her staff placed the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the allegations were driven by "ultra-right" experts and websites.
"Legends, lies, and still defamatory lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information allegedly included the home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during the Senate Panel's hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against the nominee for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred at some point after the three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the postings was related to Waters' office and disclosed the information of a member of Waters' staff, the Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is completely untrue and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and safety were put at risk as a result of this fraudulent and false claim - was, in any event, not responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded claim is completely untrue and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly provoked online criticism, including from former White House press representative Ari Fleischer.
"This denial testifies to anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that she doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
He shouldn't be challenging.
He shouldn't question the prosecutor's motives.
He must be calm and calm."
Fleischer apparently compared Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of seemingly being too angry during Thursday's trial.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate trying to light Waters out of the cushions in the midterm election, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if that's true," he whispered.
In her statement, Waters said that her office "notified the appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities of these fraudulent allegations.
"We will make sure that the advocates are denounced," she continued, "and that they will be legally liable for everything they do that is destructive and dangerous for every member of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again review - flou Rowan Atkinson spy spottery
It's now traditional to look for Brexit meaning in any new British feature film and it seems to apply to this revival of the Johnny English action comedy mockery franchise - which at the time began in 2003 with Johnny English and continued to struggle with Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Will tongue-in-the-choice selfishness on the subject of how apparent power we are the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, the unresolved Johnny English with his outpourings and rubber face has renewed his license to waste everything for the second time - and his name is a clearer indication than anything else that he is a great comic creation for non-English-speaking film audiences.
He is, of course, the mocked secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretension to sophisticated elegance, had a bit of Clouseau, a piece of Mr Bean and a good shot of that guy who contributed a single note to the Chariots of Fire theme song at the London Olympics in 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveler and international man of riddles, leaving chaos behind him, who Atkinson played at one time in the now forgotten Barclaycard ads.
There are one or two cool moments in this latest version of YOU.
I liked Johnny English coming to a helicopter while he was dressed in a medieval armoured robe and briefly chopping the screwdriver blades against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is showcased but the humor feels fairly fluffy and quirky, especially when the "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible now use self-confident comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it's aimed at children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's opposition isn't as original and focused as Atkinson's still-flying jokes in the persona of Bean.
The eternal thematic assumption is now that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A Kubercracker infiltrated Britain's super-secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all Britain's agents in the field, until the agent's dismay on duty - a deplorable little role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for a prime minister who is an inflated and beleaguered character, who is already experiencing an overall collapse of political discontent: Emma Thomson is doing her utmost with this quasi-Teresa May character but there is little in the text to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy is in danger, she must call someone out of his retirement.
And that means the struggling Johnny English himself, now employed as a teacher at some tough institution, but giving lessons from the record on how to be a secret agent, there are some cute jokes here when English offers a School of Rock-type spy school.
English is recalled to Whitehall for an emergency mission and is reunited with his former long-suffering companion Bough, again portrayed by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, an all-map sting role in which too little of Vicki Pepperdine is expected.
So the Batman and Robin are about to completely waste everything in Her Majesty's secret service again and come to Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is under the perilous spell of the charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the rabid Jason Volta, portrayed by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of ridiculous escapades: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant, causing chaos when they smuggle themselves aboard Volta's luxury sailing yacht; and English unleashes pure anarchy when he tries to use a chapter for virtual reality to get familiar with the inside of Volta's home.
For that last scene, nothing is spared, but as cute and exuberant as it may be, the whole affair is pretty much like children's TV.
Fairly mediocre.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't stop thinking: Can't the British give Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes his talent come to his right?
Labour denies that it plans for Britain to work a four-day week but be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party must consider a drastic plan that will cause Britons to work a four-day week - but pay for five days.
The party claims that company base savings caused by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution should be transferred to workers by giving them extra day off.
This will allow workers to enjoy a three-day week - but they will still take the same payment home.
Bronne says that it will "fit" the party's economic agenda and plans to put the country in the favour of the workers.
To change after a four-day week was endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to harness the changing economy.
A senior Labour party source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an ambition that fits the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of the worker as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party will not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day week during its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, the ambition is not currently endorsed by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesperson for the Labour Party said: "A four-day work week is not party policy and is not considered by the party."
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used last week's Workers' Conference to discuss his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "faceless directors" and "winners" at service companies.
The shadow minister's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not be able to recover their entire investment as a workers' government can make "withdrawals" on the basis of alleged infringement.
He also confirmed plans to place workers on corporate boards and create inclusive ownership funds to give 10 percent of equity in private sector businesses to employees, which can receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh can make them change their minds
The FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least a week and above all the question whether the Bureau's findings can convince any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked for Republican sense. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked if the FBI could dig up anything they could change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more receptive than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said at the beginning of the trial, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, came out that accusation, and said, "Did you do this?
He was bold, determined, unequivocally."
Graham's voice seems to be unchangeable.
"I have formed my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and it will require a charge of dynamite," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett has zealously denied it," Graham continued, citing Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she called couldn't confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything changing."
What is the World Citizens' Festival and did it do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World Burger Festival, an annual music event that features a particularly impressive group of stars performing and having an equally impressive goal; the end of poverty in the world.
The World Burger Festival is now in its seventh year and during the festival tens of thousands of people will flock to Central Park's Great Lawn to enjoy performances not only by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens' Festival, which began in 2012, is an expansion of the World Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively struggle against it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a GDP ticket), concertgoers had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful way to raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But just how successful was World Citizen with 12 years left to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince people to demand a call to action, or is it just another case of so-called "clickivism" - people who feel like they're making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Weltburger has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, supporting a multitude of different goals.
That said, these actions helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to more than $37 billion that will potentially affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements that stemmed from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or collected.
The group estimates that the confirmed money has so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children achieve their full potential," and promises to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after they have received more than 4,700 tweets from World Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and world citizens just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a foothold in history," Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions taken to approach the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional impairments.
In response to one of the general questions on his website that ask "what makes you think that our extreme poverty can end?"
Weltburger replied: "It will be a long and hard road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will be successful because together we have more power.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the artists performing at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use fleet for "blockade" to stop exports of Russian energy - Interior Minister
"If necessary," Washington may leave him on his fleet to stop Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - particularly where it works at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext to investigate new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to act as brokers for energy just like in Eastern Europe, the south of Europe," he said.
And, according to an officer, there are ways and means to tackle it.
"The United States has the ability, with our Fleet, to ensure that the seaways are open, and if necessary, to block, to make sure they don't land energy on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the attendees of an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that considers itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the U.S.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that it is practically the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to finance and replace fuel," he said, referring to Russia as a "single talent" with an economy dependent on fossil fuel.
The statements come as the Trump administration was on a mission to boost the export of their liquid natural gas to Europe to replace Russia, by far the cheaper option for European consumers.
For that reason, the Trump administration's officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, attempted to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, makes Berlin Moscow's "prisoners."
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is driven solely by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means to pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S.'s view provoked opposition from Germany, reaffirming their commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" standing as president in 2020, Massachusetts Senator said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously consider" standing as president after the midterm elections.
At a village meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider standing.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and correct our suffocating government and that includes a woman at the highest level of sport," she said.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider standing for president."
Warren aired her opinion on President Donald Trump during the village meeting and said he "takes the country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was very vocal in her criticism of Trump and his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
A poll released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters don't think she should stand in 2020.
Eighty-five percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not stand, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
Thirty-two percent supported the idea that she should stand.
The survey showed more support for the idea that former Governor Deval Patrick should stand, with 38 percent supporting the idea that he should stand potentially and 48 against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed to potentially stand in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont's Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin named Track Palin's PTSV at Donald Trump meeting
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he joined in September
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with an incident of domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, what he's going through since he came back, I have sympathy with other families who feel the consequences of PTSV and the injury with which our soldiers are returning," she told a audience at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans, "they come back a little differently, they come back hard, they come back and wonder if there is any respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the army has given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, assault of a woman, interference with a complaint of domestic violence, and possession of a firearm while under the influence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Station.
18 states, D.C. supports the challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that refuses asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district submitted a friend-of-the-court court order in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker and challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been made public.
She said her partner "and his violent gang members," abused her, but U.S. officials refused her request for asylum on July 20.
She was held in Texas.
The state attorneys who support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of applicants for U.S. asylum, as nations facing profound problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals (Council of Immigrant Appeals) in 2014 that allowed immigrants to apply for asylum without the necessary documents fleeing domestic violence.
District Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, federal and international laws."
"Federal laws require that all asylum applications will be determined on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such advocacy violates that policy," the friend-of-the-court legal order said.
Lawyers further argued in the legal order that the policies that deny immigrants access harm the U.S. economy and say it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop allowing asylum to victims fleeing domestic and gang violence.
"Asiel is available to those who leave their country of birth due to persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in its policy announcement on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems – even not all serious problems – that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly suffocating.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma while comforting her feverish baby boy at a evacuation center in the ruined city of Palu.
"Every minute you bring an ambulance.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents have been seen returning to their devastated homes, searching for impregnated possessions, trying to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-scale shooting, were overwhelmed.
Of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who gained a broken back and shoulder, rest outside Palu's army hospital where patients are treated outside due to continuous strong aftershocks.
Trane fills his eyes as he recounts the violent earthquake that shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
"I was pressed into the walls' rubble, I think," Haris told Associated Press, adding that he and his family were in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife calling for help, but then silenced.
I don't know what happened to her and my son.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of 'Afknouery' With 'Propaganda Advertising'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. daily that praised the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the China Daily’s paid entry into the Des Moines Register – the state’s Iowa newspaper with the most sales – after accusing China of interfering with the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, a complaint that China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials said to Reuters, a new phase in an increasing campaign by Washington is putting pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in an escalating trade war that has led to their rate rounds equalizing each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war aimed to strike exporters in states such as Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa for a long time, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now exacerbating the bullying by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading their propaganda, the Chinese government seized America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newspaper kiosk in the street here in Beijing, one will find very limited dissenting voices and not see any true reflection of the diverse opinions that the Chinese people have about China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has shrunk away from the offer to publish his article," although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans estrange women's voters from inter-elections with Kavanaugh debacle, analysts warn
While numerous top Republicans stand at Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh and defend him in the face of multiple allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will see counter-reaction during the upcoming intervening elections, especially from women.
The emotions about this are extremely high, and most Republicans are on record that they already indicate that they want to continue with the vote.
Those things cannot be reversed," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School of The Hill, in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s impeachment for an FBI investigation on the nigger would be enough to bail out fierce voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday, protesters "November is on the way!" were eavesdropping as they argued in the Senate entrance portal while the Republicans who controlled the Judicial Committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to be very high," Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it's already high; it's true.
But it can be higher, especially among swing-voice female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who don't often vote because they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing the details of her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts said a counter-reaction could follow if Republicans proceed with the confirmation.
"It has become a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee's vote or the final vote and whether Kavanaugh is put on trial, it's also about the way the Republicans handled it and how they treated her," said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
But Americans seem slightly divided over who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with slightly more choosing the latter's side.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents certainly or probably believe Ford's testimony, while 35 say they certainly or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was likely or definitively joking during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's impeachment, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified last week under oath before the Senate Judicial Committee that Kavanaugh had assaulted her at the age of 17 while he was drunk.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her while attending a party during their student years at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global web plans to launch a new internet to announce the battle between Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global web, launched a startup that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee spotted that the idea with Inrupt is "world domination."
"We have to do this now," he said of the project.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, job lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional utilities.
It's as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available at the same time and on one browser.
What is unique about personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can access that type of information.
The company calls it "personal authorization by data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's HUB John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, developers on the staff contracted to work on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers from around the world can create their own decentralized applications by using the utilities available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about the launch of an overall change whether or not, where all their business models are completely reversed overnight.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy as well as an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the Worldwide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even as he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the Worldwide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm extremely optimistic about this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross spiritual celebration
The only clergy of the Church of England to win the Victoria Cross as a fighter during World War I were honored in his home village 100 years later.
Lt.kol revered Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sharpshooter and never knew that he had won the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled on Saturday by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliant symbols" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning performance.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lt. Kol. Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "by very dense miss and under heavy fire from the field and machine guns."
He later rushed him to the fire line and with the "greatest bravery" led the line forward before he stormed man-only a field gun and knocked out three of the section.
Lt.kol Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never stand, but something that is humiliating."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath to the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Jeugorkes.
Michael Vann said he "feel honored to be able to play a role in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that a lot of people are going to give."
MMA supporters stay awake all night to watch Bellator 206, but get Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stay awake all night to watch the packed Bellator 206, just to not be able to watch the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 battles, including six on the main program that would be broadcast live through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were on their way to tell each other the battle, viewers in the UK were stunned when the cover changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unimpressed after staying awake especially for the fight until the early hours.
One supporter described the switch to the children's cartoon on Twitter as "some sick joke."
"It's government regulations that the content was not suitable at 6 a.m. and that's why they had to switch to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig, yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they would work on their schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think about the retransmission, I think we can probably work something out," Coker said.
"But it's acid in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to sort it out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But our work on it.
Trust me, when it switched, there were a lot of text messages sent back and forth and it wasn't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We will limit it to five battles instead of six – as we normally do – and we have tried to offer more to our fans and just went over our time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley has a "minority" feeling about sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority about his sexuality – but it gave him the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize before he went to high school that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he had attracted his feelings about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that becoming a parent made him care less about winning at the Olympics.
The regular provider of the years-long program, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
When he appeared as a cast on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else when he was growing up, because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, those feelings are of less feeling than, and feeling differently, the real things that gave me the power and energy to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so that he would not disappoint anyone when they would eventually find out about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT contender and has used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He says he has relieved his feelings because he is so happy to be able to live openly without consequences and wants to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man – U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “has caught him on the other side.”
Daley was married last year to the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than he is, but says the age difference has never been a issue.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he went to his first Olympic Games at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar highs and lows.
The couple became parents to a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said she had changed her "whole perspective."
"If you asked me last year, everything was about 'I have to win a gold medal,'" he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
"My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets for London 2012 – because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you're not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad,'" he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only after he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally admitted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that's what I've been dreaming about all my life - to dive in front of my home crowd at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song choices – Proud by Heather Small – which also resonated with him in the build-up to the Olympics and still gave him chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs are on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson doesn't drive and withdraws from Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to get his form straight to stop it from being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who plays for a record 12th time in the biennial event, was pulled from the game by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's four-ball games and four-numbers.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time Major winner will split his day between being a race leader and working on the practice top of his game in hopes of correcting that peel.
Even at the height of his career, he was never the right driver and therefore the 48-year-old is not the ideal person for the narrow Le Golf National track where the long rubble always punishes the erring keepers.
And as if the track on its own isn't challenging enough, Mickelson will face the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinari in his ninth match on Sunday, who has teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind, start the 12 singles games well, Mickelson's game can be absolutely essential.
Fury expressed his confidence in his husband, not that he could say much else.
"He fully understood his role today, gave me a knock on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be right tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is in the Hero Hall and he has contributed so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I didn't think he would play two games.
I've put more into perspective, but that's how things worked out and that's what we thought we should do.
He wants to be there on the job, just like anyone else."
Mickelson will outperform Nick Faldo's record for the player who played the most Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
This may mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never really matched the highlights of its individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence contributed untold aspects to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's taken, he likes to shave the crazy, and he's a wonderful guy to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed shaving with him crazy, which was fun to see.
He offers so much more than just a game."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows big lead could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead before the last day's single game in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
The Danes made their debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead, but only won nail scratch with 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"One keeps reminding oneself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won nail scraps," Bjorn said, in the photo, after watching how the Class of 2018 won 5-3 on Friday and was National at Le Golf yesterday 10-6.
So, the story will show me and everyone on the team that it's not over.
You're going to be full tomorrow.
Go out and do all the right things.
It's not over until you get the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that's to try to win the trophy, and that's where the focus remains.
I'm still saying all the time, I'm focusing on the 12 players that are in our team, but we're also well aware of who's on the other side - the best players in the world."
Looking forward to how his players got on the difficult golf course, Bjorn adds: "I will never go ahead with this.
Tomorrow is a horse of a different color.
Tomorrow it's the individual participation that comes in turn, and it's a horse of a different color.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're individually there, you're tested to your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you need to convey to players, put the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he must also put the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will want his players to sail better individually than they did as gamemates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Fury himself was already on both sides of that big last-day round, where he was part of the winning team at Brookline before he ended up as a loser when Europe achieved the "miracle of Medinah."
"I remember every vertex word of it," he said in response when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999 had braved his players on their way to that last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but one would like to start well, as seen at Brookline, as seen at Medinah.
When that momentum starts in one direction, it puts a lot of tension on those middle games.
We set up our team accordingly and classified the men we felt, you know, something magical will bring to us tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the counterattack and is in the main match against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter who are the other Europeans in the upper half of the classification.
"I chose this group of guys in this order because I think it covers it to the end," Bjorn said of his single-game choices.
Germany's new warship postponed
The German army's newest frigate would have been employed in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War era, but it won't be there until at least next year, due to faulty systems and growing costs, reports local media.
The commissioning of the "Rhineland-Pfalz", the main ship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to The Zeit newspaper quoting a military spokesman.
This vessel had to join the Navy in 2014, but the distressing post-delivery issues have plagued this ambitious project's fate.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, a sort of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as several secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from homecomings.
But continuous delays mean that the advanced warships – which apparently will enable Germany to project power overseas – will already become obsolete by the time they enter service, call The Time.
The disastrous F125 frigate struck last year when the German Navy officially refused to employ the vessel and sent it back to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Few are known about the reasons for the return, but German media have mentioned that a number of essential "software and hardware defects" make the ship useless if deployed in a campaign.
Software defects are particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be handled by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the manpower on older Bremen-class frigates.
It has also been revealed that the ship is drastically overweight, reducing its performance and reducing the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000 tons "Rheinland-Pfalz" are believed to be twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price tag for the entire project – including the training of the crew – also became a matter.
It apparently reached an incredible €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – more than the initial €2.2 billion.
Problems that have bitten the new frigates are particularly important in light of recent warnings that the power of Germany's fleet is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy's "ships that can be deployed are in the process of getting on."
The official said the issue worsened over time, because old ships were out of service, but no replacement vessels were provided.
He said that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the fleet.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
New research is being carried out on an estate in the Scottish Highlands that aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their quest for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common and soprano bat as well as the brown long-eared and daubenton bats at Invereve Tuine in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed on important locations on the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also make mobile surveys using hand indicators.
Expert clan channelises of all surveys will check the frequency of the bat calls and determine which species do.
A habitat map and report will then be compiled to create a detailed landscape-scale image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant for NTS hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important for the bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as grazing land creation and how to best manage woodlands for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping space and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as well as flypaper and some chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
The bats aren't really blind.
But because of their nightly hunting activities, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated ego-orientation technique to point out bugs and obstacles on their routes.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is very serious about bats.
It has ten trained experts who regularly do surveys and sleep-particle inspections and sometimes perform rescues.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threave estates in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Farm manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal site for them.
"Here at Threave we have a wonderful area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many veteran trees and all the good habitat.
But there's so much about bats that's still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us better understand what they need to flourish."
He stresses the need to look for bats before conservation in real estate is done because it is possible that unwitting destruction of a single place of birth can mean up to 400 females and little ones' deaths and an entire local population can be eradicated.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb or prevent them or destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to jump in to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations sail."
Ronaldo dismisses rape allegations as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has dismissed rape allegations against him as "false news" and said that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His attorneys are ready to denounce German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus have been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In an Instagram Live video in which he addressed his 142 million followers, hours after the allegations were published, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the whole thing.
I'm a happy man and everything is right," the player added smilingly.
Ronaldo's attorney is preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegation, which they, according to Reuters, called "inadmissible reporting of suspicion in the field of privacy."
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player will claim compensation for "moral damages for any amount consistent with the severity of the violation, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to the alleged insider on his knees and said he was "99 percent" a "good old" who was abandoned by the "one percent."
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photos taken at the hospital of her injuries, but later agreed to an arrangement outside the court because she was "fear of retaliation" and worried about being "obviously humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she now wants to reverse the settlement because she was still traumatized by the alleged insider.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, and this summer, in a €100 million deal, he moved to the Italian giant, Juve.
Brexit: UK will "repent forever" if their car manufacturers lose
The UK will "repent forever" if they lose their status as the world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, UK Trade Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it is "disturbing" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it will have to temporarily cease production at the plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese vehicle manufacturer said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost posts.
The Burnaston plant – which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see how production in our factory is stopped," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have raised fears about leaving the EU without a deal and how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, said they would close their Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers say supply chain risks are in the case of a Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line runs on a "just in time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be disruption at the border that the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to hold on to more than a day's stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production will be halted.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid those checks at the border."
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that, as I say, will allow to enjoy not only the current success, but for us to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The indications of not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers, are that we absolutely need to continue with what was an extremely successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but warned that added costs in the long run could reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately could cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and the Unite Union's co-operator at the plant, says his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when these posts disappear, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and acceptable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says Withuis
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed "for another week" while the backlog on nominees for the Brett Kavanaugh High Court continued, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special law adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating the Russian election interference, links between Trump supporters and Russia and possible cross-bombing of the law by the president.
Whether or not Trump is going to sack the deputy attorney general, threatening Mueller's independence, has fueled Washington's gossip stories for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of carrying a recorder to record talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president via the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, amid reports that he was on his way to thank.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "choose not to thank" Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Court hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh and further postponed the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "A date for this has not yet been determined, it may be this week, I can see that it is postponed by another week with all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I always like to keep the press up."
Some journalists will disagree with that statement: Sanders has not yet held a White House press briefing session since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarcity of information sessions is not due to a reluctance for TV journalists who are "effect-challenged," although she said, "I won't argue with the fact that they are effect-challenged."
She said direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president holds more V&A sessions than any president before him," she said, adding without quoting evidence: "We looked at the numbers."
Information sessions will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, then it's infinitely better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do it a lot and you've seen us do it a lot over the past few weeks and it's going to take the place of a press briefing session when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press statements with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press release is rare.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, by making an unbounded and with times, bizarre appearance before journalists gathered there.
Secretary of Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to show the country's gratitude and wish they would stay after Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman MSP has sent a letter with less than six months left before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed them to cover the costs of negotiated status applications for EU citizens working in the delegated public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued, on the way to expected decisions this fall.
But the UK government has also stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That's why I want to repeat how much I put each employee's contribution on the price, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefiting the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we would like you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers line player Christion Abercrombie had an emergency operation after he suffered a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee team's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State's head coach Rod Reed told journalists that the injury occurred shortly before rest.
"He came to the sidelines and kind of just collapsed there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen along the sidelines before he was placed on a portable and taken back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was out of the theater at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are "no details yet about the type/range of the injury" and Tennessee is still trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, an academic second year, is in his first season at Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He killed five times on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his total to stand for the season at 18 dead.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when buying a property in the UK and the extra cash will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tory plans.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's attempt to pull young voters
The seal tax will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year – to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal taxes when buying a property in the UK – with the extra cash that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to pull young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
The seal tax increase will be levied on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the extra money that will help the government's plans to work against homelessness.
The additional tax – which is outside the current seal tax, including the higher levels set up two years ago on second homes and homes purchased to rent – can be as much as three percent.
The Treasury expects this move to bring in up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built London properties are bought by non-UK citizens who raise prices and make it harder for first-time buyers to get a foothold in the housing door.
Many prosperous areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “spook villages” due to the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in seal tax to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping property prices high by picking up land, but not using it and encouraged Mrs May to renounce quotas on affordable homes to restore Britain's "housing disaster."
Mr. Corbyn has announced a striking series of anticipated housing improvements, including rental control and an end to "no-error" deployments.
He also wants to give more power to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my prime ministership to restoring the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means restoring our broken home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build a life.
But it can't be right that it's just as easy for individuals who don't live in the UK, as well as foreign-based companies to buy homes as it is for hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of home ownership has become a far-fetched dream, and the humiliation of homelessness has become too great a reality."
Jack Ross: "My biggest ambition is to manage Scotland."
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become the manager of Scotland at some point.
The shot, 42, enjoys the challenge of blowing new life into the North-East team, which is currently in third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country.
I got the second team, but it was already," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But as a child, I often looked at Hampden with my father for Scotland and that's something that pulls me back.
The opportunity can only come if I'm successful with club management."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland driver include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he feels no anxiety to follow such established names at such a large club, having previously turned down presentations from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, success will be measured for me by ''can I bring this club back to the Premier League?''
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get it there, but I'll probably only consider myself successful if I can get the club out there again."
Ross's career in management is only three years, after a period as assistant boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month period on Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa return from relegation to the third league and converted St Mirren from on the verge of relegation to winners of the Championship title in the next season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he says when he recalls how he took over Alloa's leads.
"I really believed the management was the right place for me, even more than playing.
This sounds bizarre, because I've done well enough, made a reasonable existence out of it and experienced pretty high points.
But the game can be difficult.
There are a lot of things that a person needs to do every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of the stress and pressure of work, but management just feels right.
I always wanted to run and now I do it, it feels the most comfortable I've been in my own skin all my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 pm. on a Saturday, found survey
The summer heat wave improved Britain's struggling pubs' incomes, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Drinks and bar groups saw sales rise by 2.7% in July – but receipts in restaurants were down by 4.8 percent, figures showed.
Peter Martin, of business consulting firm CGA, who compiled the figures, says: "Continued sunshine and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern than the previous month, June, when drinking places were up by 2.8 percent, except that restaurants were hit even worse.
The decline of 1.8 percent in restaurant trade in June only worsened in July.
Drinking-guided drinking spots and pubs have done better by far and risen more than restaurants have dropped.
Food-guided drinking places also suffered in the sun, but not as much as restaurant operators
It looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Managed bars and drinking places have increased sales by 6.6 percent for the month, with food being down by three percent."
Paul Newman, of leisure and hospitality analyst RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we've seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of big social or sports events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home out-market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a fall in sales of 4.8 percent year on year will be particularly difficult above and beyond ongoing expense pressures.
The long hot summer couldn't have come at a worse time for food-led operators and only time will show whether the more temperate temperatures we've been experiencing since August will bring the necessary relief."
Total growth in sales across beverage outlets and restaurants, including new locations that opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launches.

One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, a survey reveals.
Surveys of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in "false Insta pages"
The news has raised fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main account" to show to parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – create social media accounts that keep them secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in “false Insta accounts” — a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has raised fears that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean "main account" to show for parents, but also had private accounts.
One mother who came down on her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found a teenager urging others to "rape" her.
The research, at Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of them admitting they have private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that so many teens are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't track them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "voted for athletes" at Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the governing body's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track-and-field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a wonderful opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her far-reaching experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh has great respect for the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we're sure athletics in Scotland will greatly benefit from what she brings to the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I'm eager to act as a voice for athletes I hope I can really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who had the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Games in Atlanta under his four gold Olympic medals, is now a regular BBC connoisseur, unable to walk after having had a short-term ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today, a month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but it has fully recovered, learned again how to walk and do agility exercises today!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Breast pump advertising that compares mothers with cows divide opinions online
A breast pump company has divided opinions online with an ad that compares breast feeding mothers to cows that are milked.
In celebration of the launch of what is called the "world's first silent portable breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie released a tongue-in-cheek music video-inspired ad to showcase the freedom the pump gives to mothers who are milking out.
Four real moms dance in a barn full of straw and cows on the size of a song that includes lyrics like: "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see a tail" and "In case you haven't seen it, it's not onions, it's my breasts."
The chorus part reads: "Pump it out, pump it out, I'm feeding the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I'm milking my ladies."
But the advertisement published on the company's Facebook page caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed feedback from viewers, with many saying that it underplayed the "cruels" of the dairy industry.
"Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
As we have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are often stolen from them within days of giving birth," one wrote.

Another noted: "Considerably traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why not use it to advertise a breast pump for moms who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "The ad is so out of touch."
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that the song was "screaming" for her.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would've had one if I'd always been fed.
Milking out made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy, but I've accepted it for what it is.
"It's a great product," one wrote.
Another noted: "It's a fun ad aimed at moms who feel milky (often in their workplaces or toilets) and like "cookies."
This is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women show that they all danced with the discreet pump in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who milk out say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is dead-silent, has no wires or tubes, and fits discreetly into a feeding bra that gives women the freedom to move, hold on to their babies, and even go out while they are milking out.
Ana Balarin, partner and UKD at Mother noted: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a big and exciting launch.
By drawing a parallel between women milking out and dairy cows, we wanted to put the milking process and all its challenges in the spotlight, while demonstrating in an entertaining way where people can find connection to the wonderful sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump has gotten the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the board for designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children's style-style moved to a tent fight on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly due to fierce rhetoric and policies put in place by the Trump administration that make it harder to place children at bail.
Traditionally, most of the bailouts were also undocumented immigrants and feared that their own ability to stay in the country would be jeopardized by stepping forward to claim a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential bailiffs and other adult members of their households would have to file their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement in front of Congress, testified that the agency had arrested thousands of people who applied to bail out unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
"At least 80 percent of individuals who are either guarantors or household members of guarantors are illegal here in the country and a large number of them are criminal aliens.
That's why we continue to persecute those individuals," Mr. Albence said.
In an attempt to process the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month of arrest, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via video conferencing call, rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status with an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed unfit for emergency relief will be deported quickly.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Lawyers say those concerns are raised at a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs that a child is struggling are more easily overlooked due to the size.
They added that moving the children to the tent village without giving them enough time to emotionally prepare to say goodbye to friends can exacerbate the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria tells US, French and Turkish ‘occupational powers’ to withdraw immediately
When he addressed the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country's war was in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said the foreign forces are illegal on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and will be "handled accordingly."
"They must immediately withdraw and without any conditions," he told the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, with millions more toppled, is "amper over."
He said Damascus would continue "to wage this holy battle until we have purged all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish forces as well as Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France with more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions are in order for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "irrational fears that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing something that just needs to be a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib's last major rebel stronghold has created an opportunity to continue with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement repelled a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front who would be "exterminated."
UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to establish a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem prescribed conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee and said the panel's work should be limited to "checking the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberals are likely to hope, a state of accusation and scandals prematurely end his presidency.
In which, without a doubt, "the most dramatic finale of a presidency will ever be!"
To this day, there are no signs of slumbering.
Since 2014, peak time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CCN and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNCBC.
Fox News has an average 2.4 million peak-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" is top cable viewers with as many as 3.5 million viewers on big news.
"It's a fire that people are attracted to because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, program manager of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor" about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congress building.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The manager told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he's making me laugh,'" Scovell told me.
There is entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the storylines coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, or immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
To turn off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond being just an informed citizen when you're in the sixth hour of it to watch a panel of experts debate about Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" from his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's $15,000 jet leather flyer ("a garment thick of the hubris," said The Washington Post) and the Trump implication of the hubris.
For example, I will never look at Super Mario again in the same way.
"Part of what he does makes it feel like a reality show is that he's feeding you something every night," says Brent Montgomery, Chief Operating Officer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars," about the Trump show's changing role-sharing and daily twists in the plot (such as looking for a fight with N.F.L., Kim Jong-un).
A person can't afford to miss one episode, otherwise you'll stay behind.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He could not tear him away, not with Brett Kavanaugh on his way to appear before the Senate Court and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the scale.
"I remember when we were doing all those crazy programs at the time and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Out-of-pocket cash flow to most exciting mid-term election races in the House
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th sees an influx of money, thanks to a shift in congressional districts that has now landed two officials in a race to the same seat.
The recently changed suburban Pittsburg district allows Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring – to measure forces.
Lamb stands against another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which heavily overlaps with the new 17th.
The cards were withdrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally delineated in the Republicans' favor.
The race in the new 17th kicked off with a campaign funding competition between the major parties' financial legs, the Democratic Campaign's Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a nail crab win in a widely watched special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat has been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump has won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. has considered penalizing El Salvador, rather than supporting China, but then retreated.
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a heartfelt meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners put out the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesperson, in a statement earlier this month.
But fines were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development, and economic assistance.
The proposed fines, which include reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be difficult for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, only North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level congress and focused on security and economic progress to follow up on a similar convention last year that was considered a step forward in an effort to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administrative officials made it clear that they wanted Congress to continue to effectively end any consideration of fines for El Salvador.
Deputy President Mike Pence is now destined to address Congress, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the seriousness of the convention for the administration, the diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new wave of messages or strains from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberation on condition of anonymity.
Their statements have been confirmed by an out-of-the-box analyst who was close to the administration and also talked about the condition of anonymity.
Studying History
The next thing that could happen could be the special deliberation on Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible cross-bombing of the court, of which there is now a lot of significant evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is also likely to focus his investigation on whether Mr. Trump's campaign with Russia has cooperated in the country's attack on our elections.
If Congress were to pass into other hands, Mr. Trump's liability would have to face in that body, only when he prepares to go back before the voters, and perhaps eventually before a jury of his peer group.
It's a bunch of ashes, and I don't want to say that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable - nor is it that of his peers in Europe.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how much the battle can be stretched.
In 1938, German officials were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler, if the West had just resisted him and supported the Cheggo-Slovaks at Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years' slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and democracy's relentless course is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are now facing multiple such turning points in the face.
What would we do if Mr. Trump dismissed Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in hot water since this paper reported that he proposed last year to secretly take up the president and speculated about whether he was competent for his office.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times' report is inaccurate.
"How will we respond if Brett Kavanaugh's newly requested FBI investigation is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible charges of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the inter-election for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we look at those tests, there is a long winter ahead for democracy.
But I don't think we will fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who lived at a time in my ambassador's house.
She survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on that table carrying the swastika.
With that coming back, how can I not be an optimist about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorran's Optimists for Rapid Vienna Fight
Rangers will play host to Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that victory over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season to the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this score as a jumping-off spot for bigger things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We went into the game with the belief that we could get something and walked away with a point.
Maybe we could have won it in the end, but a tie is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we got out in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday is another big day in Europe.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a difficult game because they've had a good result in their last game, but with the crowd on our side, I'm sure we can push through and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes at the club, but there is now a feel-good factor at the place.
The group is good and the men really enjoy it; the coaching is good.
Hopefully, we can now push through, past season behind us and be successful."
Women Lose Sleep Over These Retirement Savings Fears
Despite the fact that survey participants have a clear idea of how they want to be cared for, few people talk to their family members about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to have the conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to care if you don't express your wishes long before the time runs out.
Work with your advisor and family to discuss where and how to receive care, as those choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Bring in your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you come up with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term care funding decisions may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insurance with your own capabilities – as long as you have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Cut off legal disputes at the pass.
Get a healthcare proxy in place so that you designate a trusted individual to oversee your medical care and ensure that experts meet your wishes if you can't communicate.
You'll also be eligible for your finances.
You need to choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are undefeated.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on their way to hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Play out those details in a written plan so you're ready.
"It's not just the financial issues involved, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What's the medication?
Who's going to take care of the dog?
Make sure that plan is in place."
Man shot several times in Ilfracombe with windbucks
A man was shot several times with a gust of wind when he walked home after an evening out.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which occurred at about 02:30 BST, as an "equal act."
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and police have asked for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed due to a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
With communications put out of action, emergency relief officials could not get any information from Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the center of the 7.5-scale shooting.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were brought to safety after the disaster hit.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit them.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishery and farming are the pillars of the Central Sulawesi province's economy, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times over the past 100 years by tsunamis, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A Tsuenami also hit western Donggala in 1996 and caused nine deaths.
Indonesia sits on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A major surge along the western coast of Indonesian Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December that led to a tsunami that hit 14 countries resulted in 226,000 deaths along the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong shakes hit the western coast of Sumatra late in March and early April.
Hundreds have died in Nias Island, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-scale hit the south of Java, Indonesia was most populated island, leading to a tsunami that hit the southern coast and caused almost 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6-scale quake struck near the city of Padang, capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A 7.5-scale shelling struck one of the Mentawai islands, near Sumatra, which resulted in a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and resulted in about 300 deaths.
2016: A flat-shot hit the Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh and led to destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly shooting and tsunami in 2004.
It did not lead to a tsunami this time, but more than 100 were killed because of buildings that crashed.
2018: Major shootings hit Indonesia's tourist island Lombok, with more than 500 deaths, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The shooting destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaskan governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report issued by Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he intercepted a woman's phone when she called the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody at Mat-Su Pre-trial facility and is being held on a $500 uninsured deposit, reports KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared "innocent, decisive" when asked what he was pleading, the network reported.
Palin faces three class A violations, which means he can be locked up for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B offense, punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time a criminal complaint has been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently before Alaska's Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering with the report of a crime of domestic violence, and possessing a firearm while he was drunk, in connection with the incident.
Her mother said she had thrown her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son's behavior to PTSD as a result of his duty to serve in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake led to a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been put out of action with death rates expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death sentence for suspects in NYC terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that has caused eight people's deaths - a rare punishment that has not yet been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan to derail pedestrians and a cyclist who was in his way in October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injuries, according to the notification of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these defendants carry possible death sentences, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury beat Saipov with 22 charges, which included eight charges of murder for the benefit of extortion, which are typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a complaint of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "decisive planning and forethought," prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov performed it as "disgusting, cruel, and perverse."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, injury and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the Southern District of New York has prosecuted a death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were killed after being convicted of a conspiracy to carry out spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenberges were fitted with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated no remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he was doing, police said.
Saipov said authorities were inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charges.
He also requested that the ISIS flag be displayed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal pro-Deo lawyers representing Saipov, said they were "naturally disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a life imprisonment debt with no possible release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory LP says that NIGEL FARAGE should be placed in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage made a vow to mobilize "the people's army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians had to "feel the heat" of Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's own LPs suggested he should be in control of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative back banker Peter Bone told the march in Birmingham that the UK would "be out" by the time Mr. Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge facing Mrs. May to unite her deeply divided officers was driven by pro-Roman Tories by joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise plan on the run amid attacks by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
The allies insisted that she would push through in her attempt to enter into an agreement with Brussels despite the demise – forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Mr Bone said for the Loop Meaning Loop event in Solihull that he wanted "Chequers out."
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been made a nobleman and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he were in control, we would have been out by that time,” he said.
The Wellingborough LP added: "I will stand up for Brexit, but we need to throw out Chequers."
He expressed his opposition to the EU and said: "We have not fought world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone pointed out suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false.’
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the march and told reporters: ‘I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who are actually bombing the streets and making sure we are selected in the first place.
"Please let Chequers go and start listening."
In a direct message to Mrs. May, she added: ‘First ministers must keep their jobs when they keep their promises.’
Mr Farge said the convention politicians had to "feel the heat" if they were on the threshold of violating the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"It's a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'we won't let you get away with it.'"
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to feel the heat of our political class, who are about to betray Brexit.
"We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that has given us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour convention in the city centre.
A few activists have waved Tories against Brexit banners following the group's launch this weekend.
Labour nobleman Lord Adonis spotted the conservatives for the security issues they endured with a party application as the conference opened.
“These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus in place, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is an overall smart.
"There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he said.
Warren plans to “look hard at it” to stand for president
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she will "look hard to stand for president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a city hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, stands for re-election in November against GOP State Rep Geoff Diehl who co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She is already in the middle of speculation that she may be challenging Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with constituents using the city hall format since Trump was in power.
A woman asked him if he was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that it was "time for women to go to Washington to correct our broken government, and that includes a woman very above."
Arrested in the shooting of LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayne Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They released a video of the shooting incident on Friday and asked for help identifying a man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near Southern University campus early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound in the head and was eventually killed as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday.
Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on the scene, owned a gun, and admitted that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 youth who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 lead last season and maintained an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebound balls per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton clinched world title after team commands gave him his win over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday when Mercedes' team commands would play a major role in the races.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost won for Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first entered the pits and left Hamilton to drive into traffic at the very back of the bundle, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes brushed a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced to wheel-to-wheel action leaving the Ferrari driver reluctantly risk-free from the inside at the risk of endurance after a double-movement to defend at the third angle.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the road jumping schedule and was seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the races as he held on to his ties to finish quickly and pass Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He possibly entered the pits on the 44th lap, but could not accelerate his pass in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was said that it was a difficult day, because Valtteri had done fantastically all week and was a true gentleman.
The team has done extraordinary work to have a one-two," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad lift.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday over her insistence that she did not like Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
The president spoke at a gathering in West Virginia and did not directly address the testimony Ford gave before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "common and rude and liars."
"The one thing that can happen and the lovely thing that has been going on in the Senate over the past few days, when you see the anger, when you see people who are evil and mean and liars," he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do this."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you like it?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't like it."
Well, wait a minute.
"No, we didn't like it," he said in a statement.
Feinstein was sent the letter that set out the allegations back in July against Kavanaugh by Ford, and it leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak had come from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations. I didn't like her story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But the president did not consider her denial well and commented during Saturday night's meeting: "I tell you what. It was really bad lifting language.
Maybe she doesn't, but it's the worst lift I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court nominee accused by three women of sexual misconduct and suggested that the Democrats use the allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back with any necessary means.
You see the commonality, the impiousness, they don't care who hurts them, who should surround them to get power and control," Mediaite said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars have reconciled for Friday's Elite League's loss to Belfast Giants by winning the match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early two-goal lead by throws from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the home team before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard brought Dundee the same way before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen goals tied their victory.
It was the third Elite League victory of the season for Adam Keefe's men who first lost matches and then won Friday Dundee 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth event of the season between the sides, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's open ball came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from a Kendall McFaul aid, with David Rutherford commanding the aid when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into play at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the provider for Cownie's equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead up to the first break when he threw his second goal of the evening at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard once again got them equal with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game in the second half and he made sure to win with his team's fifth point halfway through the final half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are home to Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds on plane can escape earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is considered a hero after he died when he made sure that a plane carrying hundreds of people had safely ascended.
More than 800 people have died and more are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
There are still strong aftershocks in the area and many are trapped in demolitions in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan refused Agung to leave his post in the control tower that had swung heavily at the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained motionless to make sure that the Batik Air flight 6321, which was on the runway at that time, was able to rise safely.
He then jumped from the traffic control tower when he day that it tumbled apart.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken to hear this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach the thousands with the country's disaster mitigation agency saying access to the villages of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the death toll is still increasing as many bodies are still under construction while many cannot yet be reached," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves reaching up to six meters, Palu smelled that would hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings in bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-market is being plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is chasing to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military service, "I am always asking you to work day and night to complete every task related to evacuation.
"Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people were killed.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says one man is missing after more plane crash
The airline that handled a flight that crashed in a Pacific Ocean beach lake in Micronesia now says one man was missing after saying earlier that all 47 passengers and crew safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they could not give account of a male passenger.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and that all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the collapse and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed near the runway in the beach lake.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had bypassed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane entered very low.
"It's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to walk through medium-deep water until the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the air guards panicked and shouted and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that creatures working close to improving a key also helped with an inflatable boat with the rescue to get people back and forth on land before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that 111 people have been killed in crashes of PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades, but Air Niugini has been involved in one.
Analysts set the timeline of the night when a woman was burned alive
The state closed its case on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to put together the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from various phones that showed Tellis was together Chambers on the night of her death, which contradicted his previous allegations, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the period he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's draw that night, Sanford said he was "joking because my draw was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Cell phone records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that a while after Chambers' death, Tellis Chambers' messages, calls and contact information were erased from his phone.
"He took her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final stages on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the hearing to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative outlook of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and addressing social issues.
They want to go back to the foundations and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent revival in the UK by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
There's a black person?!
New York's granddaughter sues a couple because she's fired after "racist" text
A New York granddaughter sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misaddressed message from the mother who complained that she was "still a black person."
The couple deny that they are racist and compare the lawsuit with "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was agitated when she found out that the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEE N<0xC3><0x93>N N<0xC3><0x93>N A SWART PERSON," Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to me twice Maurice.
After she found out her mistake, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired me Maurice, saying that they were out-going nanny who was African-American, did bad work and that she was expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Me Maurice was paid for her one day's work and then sent home with an Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for damages over the repayment and seeks his damages up to the amount of $350 per day for the six months, resident work for which she was initially appointed, although it was without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you're not doing such good," she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple struck back at the allegations that they were racist and said it was the reasonable thing to end Maurice's employment and feared that they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist people," said Joel Plasco.
"But would you put your children in the hands of someone with whom you were rude, even if it had been by abortion?"
Your newborn baby?
Come on now."
Plasco compared the case to "extortion," saying his wife would have had a baby in two months and was in a "very difficult situation."
"You're just going to get a person back?"
It's not a very nice thing to do," the investment banker added.
While the trial continues, the court of public opinion had been quick to bring the couple on social media and hijack them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that a talking bear would not connect readers.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
"It's very entertaining that we know about Paddington's great success."
She said her father would have been furious if his work had been rejected. He was a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the children's book about the little toy bear. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's announcement after his death was "bittersweet."
About Paddington, who she describes as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was quietly proud of his ultimate success.
"He was quite a quiet man and he wasn't an apple-like person," she said.
But because Paddington was genuine to him, it was almost as if you had a child who achieved something: you're proud of them, even if it's not your job.
I think he considered Paddington's success kind of that way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always gave the honor to Paddington himself."
My daughter was about to die and I had to say hello to the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was chased to Nice's Louis Pasteur 2 hospital where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad often called to say that it was really bad, that they didn't expect her to make it," Ms. Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I got the call from Nad to say that she would die within the next two minutes and that I had to greet her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, heart lamb.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicine the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating was slowly getting up and leaving her system.
She was dead for a while and the body was closing.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that this was unfolding.
I couldn't shake or scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to put it together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who by that time was saddened by the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - unaware of the trial she had gone through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had my head cut and the tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I got an overwhelming sympathy for Nad on the flight.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Sad women post cards to prevent suicides on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards for a while on a Wallian bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Me Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself at 18.
"I don't want anyone to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Me Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and said her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
She always said she had a smile on her face."
However, he gave up work before he died because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
Me Davis said, "I'm worried there's going to be a domino effect."
Me Davis designed the cards, "to let people know that there are people out there who you can go to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit in silence - you have to talk."
Me Humphreys, who has been a friend of Me Davies for years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old husband, not long after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt sick or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the very lowest point on Christmas Day - when the children opened their gifts, he didn't make eye contact or anything with them."
She said her death was very traumatic for them, but that they had to work through it: "It ripped a hole through the family.
This divides us.
We all have to fight and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still undecided as FBI investigation begins
"I thought if we could actually get something like what he asked for - a timeless investigation that didn't bribe us - we might bring some unity," Mr Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "falling apart" under entrenched partisan assembly.
Why would Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not have had to set up the FBI investigation?
Their attitude is all due to the timing.
The intervening elections are only weeks away, on 6 November - if, as is expected, the Republicans fail, then they will be greatly weakened in their efforts to get the man they want to go to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush called senators to influence them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House and who met his wife Ashley and were Mr. Bush's personal secretaries.
What happens after the FBI reports?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes on the Senate floor that will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break a parole record and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's 'down' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong suction quoted data from the South's unification cabinet saying there were 1,127 overruns last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said stricter border control between North Korea and China and higher rates demanded by human traffickers were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
The vast majority of Northerners are finally offered South Korea citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flights via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the high-security demilitarized zone (DMS) between the two Koreas.
China considers the invaders to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them by force.
Relations between the North and the South - who are still technically at war with each other - have improved remarkably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for talks centered around the strike negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons.
It came to the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore when they agreed in broad terms to work together for the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions on Saturday for the lack of progress since.
"Without any confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first," Ri said in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "histerious," saying he is incompetent to serve on the Supreme Court
House minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "histerious" and said he was temperamentally incompetent to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments on Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman ever acted like that, they would say 'histerious'," Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied emotional allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh had been very emotional and at times he almost screamed and stifled while discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly denounced Democrats on the committee and called the allegations against him a "illegal and coordinated character assassination," organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he's making himself uncomfortable with those statements and the way he went after the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi was asked if she would try to charge Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Democrats won the majority in the House of Commons.
"I'll say that -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not competent to be in the Supreme Court, but to be in the court on which he is currently," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Ommegang Appeal Court.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade as he was considered a conservative right.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh skipped questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to say 'it's not wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
Women have to deal with this.
It's a righteous diatribe, months and years of anger that overcooks, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive officer somewhere, who also said that she was crying when she got angry, but developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she spoke to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just went on.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tranes are permissible as a partial exit for toe because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest memories of an early job in a male-dominated office is where I once found myself crying with nameless anger and being gripped by an older woman at my neck - a cold driver for whom I was a little scared - who dragged me into a report.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and will be happy because they've had an impact on you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an out-of-court relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and he had to leave the races, me Schroeder, very frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she could not investigate the idea that she could run for president.
"I didn't think well about the decision," she told me lying 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind with fundraising and so she made a vow that she would not enter the races unless she raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that of her supporters who gave for men $1,000, she would only give her $250.
"Do they think I'm going to give up?" she asked.
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions - grateful for the people who supported her, frustrated with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and to target voters rather than delegates, and angry at sexism - that she stabbed.
You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalled about how the press reacted to her.
"You would have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my gravestone?
"She's crying?"
How the U.S.-China trade war might be good for Beijing
The opening salvo of the trade war between the U.S. and China was over-suffocating and while the battle for far-off ends, a disagreement between the countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, launched the first warning earlier this year by charging important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation rolled in this week with new tariffs affecting $200 trillion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 trillion) items and effectively taxing half of the goods entering the U.S. from China.
Beijing has retaliated every time and recently hit tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 trillion of US goods.
China has promised to equalize the U.S. shot-by-shot and the world's largest economy will not move soon.
Getting Washington to stand back means handing over requests, but meeting the U.S. requests in public will be too much of a embarrassment to Xi Jinping, China's president.
Experts still say that if Beijing plays its cards right, pressure on U.S. trade war over the long-term China can positively support by lowering the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the conditions that can start an economic toll in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than spectators have already confessed before," said Abigail Grace, a research assistant who focuses on Asia in the middle of New American Security, a thinker.
Syria ‘ready’ for refugees to return, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country devastated by a war for more than seven years.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation at ground level is more stable and secure due to progress in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to normal.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the one-sided economic measures that targeted their daily lives and their existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
A further six million people still living in the country need philanthropic assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid to rebuild the flattened country.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that secured the invasion.
Europe's Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup and Team USA with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, pitched his T-hold in the water at the par-3 16th hole and conceded his game to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has flashed in all his rounds and has become one of the 1-of-4 players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was blown 5&4 by the player with the lowest rank on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The player with the world's highest rank, Dustin Johnson, has 2 and 1 cases to land Poulter of England who may have played in his final Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, has become the tournament's European winner of all time with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but I can't help it today.
It's been a rough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy to have the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm glad I could help," an emotional Garcia said after the European victory.
He handed the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who won US-born Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game on Sunday.
The incredible pride I feel, to conquer Tiger Woods, I grew up and looked at that old one," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four of his games in France and now has a record 13-21-3 career Ryder cup record.
A strange statistic by one of the greatest players of all time and he won 14 major titles second to only Jack Nicklaus.
Span USA struggled all week to find the clean-up field with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke on behalf of his team after a disappointing performance: "I'm proud of these guys. They fought.
There was a time in the morning when we had a little bit of heat on Europe.
We've scrapped it.
Take care of Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All 12 of his players have played very well.
We will regroup. I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to serve as their captain.
You have to keep your hat.
We're overrated."
