Shouting at the World
The marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland has gone well and the shouts and calls out in nature are starting to draw people across the globe.
“You own the hack, I need Iceland,” says a woman in the big world in comments from the marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland on YouTube.
Another observer said he would keep Iceland in his heart for all eternity, and a young woman said she would have to get to Iceland as soon as her fiancé was settled there.
However, she is unhappy in the United States and therefore expects to have to wait for a few more months.
Another viewer asks if the route to Iceland is possible, because there are no planes.
It doesn’t matter if it comes from a different time zone.
Egil <0xC3><0x9E><0xC3><0xB3>r<0xC3><0xB0>arson of the advertising agency Peel, who made the ads together with the international advertising agency M&C Saatchi, says the receptions have been expected further.
“I came to many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have gone very well, but this new campaign has already started to hit the mark.
Basically, this is about creating a PR value, it is getting foreign media to discuss the campaign, and it has gone incredibly well.
Over a relatively short period of time, we have received coverage in about seven hundred media outlets around the world, covering a total of about two billion people.
The value of that coverage is valued at ISK 1.8 billion.
It's not a bad thing."
The main market of all equals is the United States and has gone very well since the United States is not on its way to the country in a hurry.
According to Egils, well-known markets such as Denmark, the UK and Germany have also taken care of, such as Russia, which comes as a surprise.
Then came a reaction from foreign countries, such as India, which was not particularly elaborated.
“These ads have traveled more than we expected,” says Egil, who may have seen more than four million people watch the content on YouTube.
“We couldn’t have asked for a better start.”
<0xC3><0x85>rni S<0xC3><0xA6>berg, photographer of the morning magazine, took the pictures here at the opening of the exhibition with the headline “Let It Out” in the middle of the last month.
The hikes took place wide and wide, such as the Sk<0xC3><0xB3>lavör<0xC3><0xB0>ur Trail in Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k, Reynisfjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur, Sk<0xC3><0xB3>garfoss, S<0xC3><0xB3>lheimajökull and Hjörleifshöf<0xC3><0xB0>ur cave.
The directors were Samuel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar P<0xC3><0xA1>ll <0xC3><0x93>lafsson at Skoti productions and <0xC3><0x93>ttar Gu<0xC3><0xB0>nason.
The roles in the series included the Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, who are from Cuba and Hungary.
Tens of Icelanders came to make the ads, but at the same time as the recordings were made in South Iceland, there was another group in West Iceland and Westfjords.
According to Egils, “Let It Out” is only the first team in the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, but the goal is a winter campaign in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
“This is just the first step in this work for the Icelandic Institute,” says Egill, adding that the collaboration with M&C Saatchi has gone extremely well.
“It’s great to work with them.
In such projects, it is very important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we are talking to.”
Explosives: Discuss the situation in the labour market, pension funds and much more
<0xC3><0x81>smundur Einar Da<0xC3><0xB0>ason, Minister of Social Affairs and Children’s Affairs, will meet at Sprengisand, which starts at 10 a.m.
He is also the Minister of Labour and discusses the position in the labour market as such, the Icelandair case and other issues.
He also deals with rural areas and transport work out of a country that has gone bad and has been controversial in recent years and decades.
Ragnar <0xC3><0x9E><0xC3><0xB3>r Ing<0xC3><0xB3>lfsson, Chairman of VR, will also take part in the show, but he will discuss his criticism of the investment of pension funds and present ideas that trade unions and employers are withdrawing from the fund’s boards in order to reduce the risk of conflicts of interest.
Ivar Ingimarsson, a tourist in East Iceland, and <0xC3><0x81>rnhei<0xC3><0xB0>i J<0xC3><0xB3>hannsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, Director of Nordic Marketing, will also discuss the situation in tourism in the countryside.
They will look forward to the autumn and wonder if the success of the summer is a false precept on what is to come.
You can listen to the show below, but it starts at ten o’clock.
This is what it looks like 25 years later.
Elisa Donovan had a successful career in all aspects of youth.
However, she won the award for her role as Amber in the film Clueless 25 years ago.
She also starred in Sabrina: The Teenage Witch, along with Melissu Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury, and Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is 49 years old, married to one child.
Little has worn her lately, but she managed to look over the road and talk about Clueless on an Australian television show in the days.
She speaks beautifully about Brittany Murphy who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she has been a great person.
“I have to admit that I mostly based my character on girls I met in schools that weren’t good to me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who those characters were," Donovan said of his play in Clueless.
I didn’t want to leave the police station after a night out.
About fifty cases came on board the police in the capital area today and says in the police diary that the cases have been varied.
The day at the police station in Hverfisgata started with the police having to have a part of a man who had recently been released from the prison after staying there because of a drunk driving.
The man did not want to leave after he was released and did not obey the orders of the police who told him to leave.
The man won a further stay at the police station because of his progress.
In the morning, a man was arrested on suspicion of breaking into a company in K<0xC3><0xB3>pavogur.
Police also had to have a handover of two men in Brei<0xC3><0xB0>holt due to reports of a body attack.
Also, a woman who sat in a shopping centre in K<0xC3><0xB3>pavogi could not pay for the bill at the end of the meal and was therefore called to the police.
There was also a car crash in the city centre this morning.
The driver of the white Renault transmission vehicle searched for her for a moment and she was then taken by an unfree hand.
The car has not been found.
The Curse of the Joy Team - The Horrible Destiny of the Joy Stars
This theory has taken flight on the Internet that a curse rests on the series about the Joy Team, but actress Naya Rivera drowned in California in the days, becoming the third main character of the series to leave life far ahead of age.
Glee is a popular series of songs, dances and joys.
They talked about the joys of youth in high school, their love and their destiny.
It was not always taken out with the soul to be in the joy band, but through singing and dancing the characters of the episodes seemed to overcome every situation that arose in their lives.
But outside the scene, there has been so much turmoil over the actors and employees of the show, so much so that the theories have awakened that the curse rests on the show.
Naya Marie Rivera played the role of Santöna Lopez in the show, a cheerleader who did not call all his grandmother.
After the season ended, Rivera went on to have actor Ryan Dorsey and had his first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and subsequently divorced.
However, Dorsey refused to file a complaint and the domestic violence was dropped.
On July 8, Rivera was reported missing after her four-year-old son was found alone on a boat on Lake Piru, California.
The boy was found sleeping in the life jacket on board the boat, and he was able to report to the police authorities that he and his mother had sunk and Rivera would have brought him back into the boat but never returned there himself.
A huge search for Rivera.
The day after the search began, the chief of police in the area reported that we had searched the area since Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found dead and was officially sentenced to death.
It is believed that she has fallen into a lot of currents in the water and used her last requirement to save her son.
D<0xC3><0xA1>nar<0xC3><0xB8>r had been reported drunk by accident.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson in the show, the American football player with the angelic stature who played a key role in bringing the Joy team to the road and respect.
Outside the show, however, Moneith struggled with personal demons.
From the age of 13 he had struggled with addiction and tried hard to get away from it.
In 2013, his colleagues in the show found enough, intervened, and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith then went on treatment and all seemed to be looking for a better way.
Only two months after he completed treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after going out to have fun with friends.
Banamein proved to be a deadly mixture of drugs and alcohol.
It was not believed that there was a will.
Moneith had gone through treatment and his endurance before the drug administration had decreased to such an extent that the dose he had previously tolerated well, proved fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His death was heavy on his colleagues, but on the basis of his counterpart, Lea Michele, it was decided to continue the scenes and dedicated them to a whole part of the memory of Moneith and his character Finn.
Mark Wayne Salling played the role of Noah “Puck” Puckerman in the shows, Puck was an American footballer, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellows in the Joy Team, or until he gained the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his Los Angeles home on suspicion of child pornography.
When we searched his home, he found a huge amount of child pornography and the matter soon became public.
It was clear that Salling had already been.
He was accused and convicted of his crime.
He had four to seven years in prison, as well as having to be on a sex offender list and seeking treatment for childbearing.
Before the judge had determined the punishment, Salling, who was then free from insurance, was found dead near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It wasn’t just the actors who fell from far ahead.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the show.
He fell asleep in 2013 at just 41 years of age.
The show also featured a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was the younger sister of the big star Julia Roberts and did not bear her sister a more beautiful story, but she accused Roberts of great governance and deplorable behavior.
Motes took her own life in 2014, but she struggled with severe depression.
She left a letter to her boyfriend, telling her mother and sister, among other things, to be responsible for how she was treated.
“My mother and my so-called siblings get nothing from me except the memory that it was the ones that caused my worst depression.”
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of using her fellow actors' moustache and transition to the scene and having a superstar scene.
Jesse Luken played a guest role in the show in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with drunk driving in 2019, which saw a lot of scandal.
Actor Heather Morris played a major role in the show.
In 2010 she became aware of the fact that she made nude photos of her and published them on the Internet.
The actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both played in the show and had a love affair outside of the show.
Benoist later reported that Jenner had committed violence in the relationship.
You can put flowers on almost anything.
It increases the development of children when they are allowed to play outside in a garden with their parents to grow flowers and to observe them grow and thrive.
It is also endlessly possible to do with flowers as Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just having time with the kids in the garden is something that will never be forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the fragrance and, of course, the precious time they had with their parents.
Bought a boat after 10th grade
“I don’t think there are many seamen who work in the country’s schools,” says Axel <0xC3><0x96>rn Gu<0xC3><0xB0>mundsson, who conducts beach fishing in the summer but studies psychology at the University of Iceland during the winter season.
Beach fishing is a very comfortable summer job when you are in training.
If you fish well, you can have a good income and I think it’s great to be able to avoid taking a student loan.
The harvests also do me a good job in the winter,” says Axel <0xC3><0x96>rn Gu<0xC3><0xB0>mundsson, a 25-year-old psychologist, who is fishing for the beach this summer.
Axel was the latest to dock at T<0xC3><0xA1>lknafjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur when a journalist got to talk about him late in the evening at the beginning of the week."
“The winter I was in the tenth grade, I took command privileges for boats that are under 12 meters long and I bought my boat in the summer after I finished elementary school.
I’ve been fishing on my boat all summer.
I bought the boat from my acquaintance, Hartmann J<0xC3><0xB3>nss<0xC3><0xB3>n, and I had the boat named his name.
Hartmann became an adult when I bought the boat and stopped being at sea and he was very happy when he saw that the boat bore his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took the boat,” Axel says, adding that he bought the three-million-dollar boat.
“I made a deal with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer, but the other half at the end of the summer when I had been fishing.
So I had the boat in debt at the end of my first summer."
But how could a boy have one and a half million dollars to pay out on a boat when he had just finished elementary school?
“I had been putting up and collecting money, I had been working with my dad to sea when I was a boy, I was all summer fishing with him and got my share.
I also put my money in my boat.”
Axel was born in <0xC3><0x8D>safjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur, from where all his mother's people are, but he has lived in K<0xC3><0xB3>pavogur since he was a boy.
“I can fish here in the western area because I have a legal home with my grandmother in <0xC3><0x8D>safjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur.
I learned about this area west of sledding with my dad.
I move between the distances depending on how I feel, because this fishing area covers all of the Westfjords.
Although I think it’s best to be in the West, I’ve also been around Sn<0xC3><0xA6>fellsneset and beyond.
I’ve also provided for the south, but rather for the gray-leave,” says Axel, who always runs one flame in the morning and sometimes says talking to the m<0xC3><0xA1>vana and singing in front of the sky, during the alone hours together on the ballerina.
“The network on the sea is good, so I can call, listen to audio and music.
I don’t think it’s important to be alone on a boat.
Of course, I try to avoid landing in the haystack, but certainly sometimes something has been weathering, but never a big risk," says Axel, who is lucky that he is never seaweed.
He says the length of the working day depends on how the hunts go each time.
“I’ve never been fishing for more than 14 hours at a time, but I’ve also been fishing in other systems, for example in the rental quota, but then I’ve been fishing continuously for one and a half days in the open sea.”
He says he can catch 770 kilos a day, which he feels hampered.
“Other restrictions are that I cannot fish Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and I can only fish for twelve days a month, those four months over which beach fishing stands, in May, June, July and August.
In my opinion, seafarers should choose their fishing days according to the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is supposed to calm people instead of having 48 days throughout the summer and can choose according to their heads.
So the localisation could also go because of me and sea space that is well located at the fish pond should be able to enjoy it," says Axel, who draws most of the cod from salty seas on his shore fishing, but also only ufsa and unique other types of rivers with it.
Axel works over the winter season with the university programme at the N<0xC3><0xBA>pi kindergarten in K<0xC3><0xB3>pavogi.
“I don’t think there are many seamen who work in the country’s preschools,” Axel says proudly, adding that he only intended to work temporarily at the preschool.
“I’m stuck because I think this is a great job.
I hope that psychology studies will benefit me at the preschool level in the future," says Axel, who is also a long way from studying business studies.
An error in the registry prevented homecoming permissions
An error in the registration form that people fill out when it comes to the country caused a person, residing here in the country, not to be called back into sampling.
A registration number is not required if the person concerned fills out the form in English, as is when it is done in Icelandic.
“This will be examined this week,” says an expert in the field of epidemiology.
Three domestic infections were reported at the National Hospital’s virology department yesterday.
One of the positives came to the country on 15 July, two days after the so-called “home remedies” rules came into force.
Those who lived in Iceland were then screened at the arrival to the country and again invited to sampling four to five days later.
In the afternoon news, R<0xC3><0x9A>V stated that the person had, on the other hand, followed the old system.
The sample at the border was negative and it was not called back in screening for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigf<0xC3><0xBA>sd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, an expert in the field of occupational health at the University of Iceland, says in a conversation with the newsroom that this may be due to errors in the electronic record sheet.
Filling out the registration form in English is not a condition to insert a ID number as is in the Icelandic version.
It was primarily intended for foreign tourists.
Therefore, the person was not automatically asked to enter the sample.
Kamilla says many, however, have followed the rules of homecoming, although they have filled out the registration form in English, and in some cases, employers have also been awake to send people back to sampling after it came to the country.
“This week we’ll be looking at how to make it easier for people to get their attention on the process.”
The man is in solitary confinement and six have been placed in hospital.
They all went to the rehearsal, but two were beginning to show signs.
The three infections detected yesterday are currently being infected, mostly due to two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, a series analysis of Icelandic genetic analyses has shown that there are variations of the coronavirus that have not been found here before.
In the second case, the peasants have pointed out that Israel, although it is known that the person who brought the virus to the country had also travelled to other European countries.
Kamilla says there should be tomorrow where the other virus was coming from.
A total of 15 are now in isolation according to the COVID.
There are 135 of them.
Four out of five infected unaffiliated
Five domestic animals have been identified in the country in recent days.
Of these, four are completely unrelated and have not yet been found the source of the infection that occurred at the Rey Cup sports tournament yesterday.
Dehydration is still ongoing.
Initially, in the third decade, the number of people sent to the hospital was very high, but they were reduced to sixteen.
In total, 34 people are infected with these new infections that were detected yesterday.
This is the second time in a short period of time that infection is detected in sports events and has raised questions about whether or not to hold such events.
J<0xC3><0xB3>hann K. J<0xC3><0xB3>hannsson, Head of Communications at the National Police Department, says it very slowly, as long as people follow the criteria and rules.
“We are constantly pressing for all those who live here that it is necessary to maintain individual protection against infection.
We also need to challenge people who are holding events that there are certain rules in progress that need to be followed.
“You can have an event,” said John.
He says that it is possible to prevent infection by keeping the air of individual infectious agents.
In addition, the rules and criteria are in constant review.
“What needs to be done, and what the Department of Public Health and the National Medical Service are constantly pressing for people, is to take into account this individual infection prevention.
Both at home and at the same time at service companies.
People wash their hands and use alcohol.
It prevents the spread of infection from continuing," says John.
“We need to urge people to continue on the good road we were on so that we can keep up the success we have achieved so far.”
40% of victims of COVID-19 had diabetes 2
Devon Brumfield heard on the phone how hard her father had to catch her breath.
Her father had diabetes and she urged him to seek medical help.
The next day, he was dead.
The death was caused by sudden difficulty in breathing due to coronavirus infections.
Diabetes was identified in the death certificate as an underlying problem and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is afraid that the same will happen.
The Reuters news agency says the fear of Brumfield is not without reason.
Figures from a new study conducted by the U.S. government show that nearly 40% of those who were diagnosed with diabetes 2 were the underlying disease.
When the proportion of those who had not reached the age of 65 years is examined, the proportion increases to half.
The U.S. Department of Defense (CDC) survey included more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died from the coronavirus during the period from February to May.
Jonathan Wortham, an infectious disease expert at the CDC, says the results are striking, not least for those diagnosed with diabetes 2 and their loved ones.
In a slow growth, Reuters surveyed the responses of the 12 states that responded to similar rates.
10 states, including California, Arizona, and Colombia, are not yet beginning to report underlying diseases.
“Cyclerosis was already an epidemic in slow growth.
Now COVID-19 has broken through like a powerful age," said Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes is more common among blacks and people of South American origin, who have also gone worse out of the coronavirus.
One of the very best defenses for those with diabetes mellitus 2 is to keep the disease at bay with fitness, a healthy diet and the assistance of health professionals.
However, the Coronavirus age has made it difficult for many people to keep a routine.
In addition, the high price of insulin has consumed some to continue attending work and thus stop being exposed to the virus.
According to Reuters, the U.S. authorities may be aware of the risks that those with diabetes 2 could have caused by the virus.
When SARS coronavirus passed in 2003, more than 20% of them had the disease, and in the swine flu pandemic in 2009, this group was three times more likely to have to go to hospital.
When MERS did so in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were hospitalized for diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a scientist at Yale University, says that because the effects of the COVID-19 virus could be longer, the epidemic has been deprived of a number of previously unknown complications.
“I’m afraid we’ll see a flood of problems when this is over,” said Andrew Bolton, chairman of the International Diabetes Association.
Physicians have warned that coronary artery disease could lead to immediate increases in complications associated with diabetes, including kidney disease and renal dialysis.
As a direct new study, the coronavirus could lead to an increase in diabetes cases.
Reuters says scientists are trying to understand the relationship between the coronavirus and diabetes 2.
The virus depends on the heart, lung and kidney, organs that are already weak in many people with diabetes.
Then, a high percentage of glucose and lipids in diabetics can induce a true “cell messenger storm,” as it is called when the immune system reacts too hard and responds to the body.
Inflammatory epithelial cells may also lead to inflammation, which in turn can lead to fatal blood clots.
“It’s all one big puzzle game,” says Dela Cruz.
“It’s all related to each other.”
The news has been corrected.
“We were invited to camp, so they left the room.”
The couple <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n Magn<0xC3><0xBA>sd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir and Atli Bollason received an unusual offer from the artist Ragnari Kjartansson to have sex in front of a camera for a work that the artist was installing in Paris.
“We loved each other so it wasn’t difficult.”
Atli Bollason never forgets when he met his wife and midwife, <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n Magn<0xC3><0xBA>sd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, for the first time.
“I was very pleased with her.
Of course, it was just the show, but I thought it was pretty cute too.
And I still feel it," he said.
This is also the first time that the husband has regularly re-opened his first meeting.
“I’ve always heard this story.
“Last weekend,” she said, adding that she was attracted to her husband at the first meeting.
“I felt and felt so much excitement around Atla that I felt.
There is a lot going on and a lot going on and I liked it.”
Atli says the couple have emphasized in their relationship to go their own ways.
“We don’t tie our bags to the same knots as our companions.
We avoid routines that we detect around us.”
There is a possible reason why they took the assignment from Ragnari Kjartansson's artist only acknowledging, though it would be hardly unusual to say so.
“Christine Anna, our mutual friend, is in touch with us and asks if we can come and eat dessert with her, Ragga and Ragnar’s Ingibjörg wife, on Snaps.”
They were invited, met the threesome on Snaps and got desert wine and each dessert.
They listened to Ragnar, who led them through his plans for an art exhibition that he thought would be set up at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the autumn.
“He had a multi-layered video work called Scenes from Western Culture.
He explained it in a simple way.”
<0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n says he described the work as banal and decadent late from everyday life in the West.
“He had sketches of all the scenes he was going to shoot and last he told us about what he wanted to know if we were interested in participating in.”
Senan whom Ragnar asked the couple to participate in was to show young middle class couples to love in a minimal room.
“It’s a relationship with the beginning and the end,” says Atli.
The couple didn’t know Ragnar much though they knew about him and he of them “but they knew us and felt comfortable in this.
They said they didn’t want to advertise.
Maybe they thought they wouldn’t get the right people, but people who get sexual advances from performing for others.”
They asked Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn’t take long.
“When we ran out of Snaps, we said, ‘We’re not just into this?
It was just like that.
I trust Ragnari as an artist and his entire team,” says <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n and Atli.
“It’s about love and intimacy.”
Senan was taken up in a nice apartment on the M<0xC3><0xBD>rar street.
There was a very silly movie theater; a cameraman, Ragnar and a soundman and the couple.
After the recording had been turned on, everyone left the room to wait outside in a car except Atli and Asr<0xC3><0xBA>n.
“We haven’t decided how we should be.
We were given some guidance but we tried to forget the time and place.
I don’t know what we’re doing and what we’re doing for each other.
It wasn’t a game, we just loved each other so it wasn’t complicated,” says Asr<0xC3><0xBA>n.
Was it romantic?
“Yes, it was a bit romantic,” says Atli and <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n.
“We were invited to camp before they left the room.
It was a bit like being on vacation at a nice hotel in Paris."
The team was pleased with the performance of the couple in the work that moved them.
“When Tommi saw this, he cried, and it seemed so beautiful to him,” says Atli.
“It’s just as much about love and intimacy as it is about relationships,” says <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n.
The couple’s parents have seen the work and tell Atli that his mother heard the voice in the son at the Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k Art Museum and then realized that he was part of the work.
“Then she turns around and starts to pee on this,” says Atli.
My mom and dad saw it in Paris.
We didn’t tell anyone that way, but then my dad just sent me a message and said: “It’s nice to meet the little family in the Palais de Tokyo,” recalls Asr<0xC3><0xBA>n.
And will the participation in the work have deepened the relationship between Asr<0xC3><0xBA>n and Atla?
“At least we’re still together, so maybe it’s something.
This at least deepened my relationship with the related family,” says <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n and laughs.
<0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n himself saw the work in Copenhagen with his colleague.
“I found it a little hard not to be with you but someone else,” she says, turning to her husband.
“But it was nice to see this because it’s only one late in much bigger work and when you saw this with the other works it’s very nice.
I was able to get away from it and was just proud.
And there was a little bean in my stomach," says Asr<0xC3><0xBA>n, who was pregnant by the second child of the couple when the tendon was taken up.
“It was just beautiful.”
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to <0xC3><0x81>sr<0xC3><0xBA>n and Atla in Love Stories at R<0xC3><0xA1>s 1.
Swansea with a win in the first playoffs
Swansea won 1-0 at Brentford in a dramatic game.
This was the first game of the teams in the playoffs to get into the English Premier League.
The game took place in Swansea, Wales.
The score was 0-0.
At the age of 64, the Swansea natives were given a vite in the 64th minute, but Andre Ayew broke the bogalist from the vite point and allowed to defend himself.
Only two minutes later, Rico Henry, player Brentford, received the red card.
Brentford therefore played the rest of the game one fewer and in the 82nd minute, Swansea players took advantage of the team difference.
Andre Ayew then added the crosshairs by scoring a great goal and securing Swansea 1-0 victory.
Swansea will lead 1-0 in the final, but the second game will take place next Wednesday at Brentford.
Unsubscribed for five years from 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the U.S. ambassador to Iceland, is in the spotlight of the media after CBS reported this morning that he wanted an armed lifeguard where he feared for his life.
However, it has not been without difficulty for the President of the United States to appoint an ambassador here in the country.
Since Carol Van Voorst resigned from the U.S. Ambassador's office in April 2009, the country has been without ambassadors for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst resigned from office under special circumstances, but Kastl<0xC3><0xA4>ngs reported from 2009 that she should have received the F<0xC3><0xA1>lk<0xC3><0xB3><0xC3><0xB0>ur.
On the way to a farewell meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a call from the Presidential Office stating that she would not be honored.
After leaving Iceland, she taught international relations with Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until Van Voorst's successor came to work, in September 2010.
In some ways, Robert S. Connan may have been appointed as ambassador, but he did not.
Loius Ariega had worked in the foreign service for decades.
He resigned in the autumn of 2013 and took up the post of ambassador to Guatemala.
Then we took a second non-consignment period.
Robert Barber received U.S. Senate approval in January 2015 and came to work soon after, but no ambassadors had been there for 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed but not a diplomat, but had served as a lawyer and a short-term election fund Baracks Obama.
He resigned as soon as Donald Trump took over the presidency on January 20, 2017, as usual with a politically appointed ambassador.
Trump’s administration was unusual for both ambassadors and high-ranking officials to be appointed to the Washington administration.
It took two years for the U.S. Senate to invite Jeffrey Ross Gunter to his meeting to ask him the questions and confirm that he is an ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony to parliament he said he had never come to Iceland but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who had died, had been broken by the Dutch mountain.
Gunter is politically organized, was previously a skin doctor in California and has been prominent in the Jewish Association of the Republican Jewish Coalition.
The casino owner Sheldon Adelson formed the association, but Adelson is a strong supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, but no ambassadors had been in Iceland since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest case in Iceland.
The reason is both how long the Trump administration was to appoint people in key positions as well as in recent years the work of the U.S. Congress has drawn a lot in the long run, including confirming the ambassador in office.
Since 2009, a total of five years have been without a messenger in Iceland.
However, it has not prevented the implementation of the embassy which opened its new headquarters at Engjateig.
The projects are thought to have cost about 6.5 billion, but the roof walls surround the building and the glass is in all windows.
It seems, however, that it has not been enough to fill the current ambassador’s sense of security because he is said to be afraid of his life and has wanted to get armed lifeguards.
Former player <0xC3><0x8D>BV became involved in racism in Iceland – “It was a mistake to come to Iceland”
Tonny Mawejje, former player of IBV, says he has experienced racism when he was in Iceland and that he is looking forward to coming to Iceland.
This appears in an interview with Tonny, who appears on the Ugandan media Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined the Uganda Police FC team as a player in Uganda’s top division.
In an interview with the Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about many things, including his time here in Iceland, where he played with <0xC3><0x8D>BV, Val and Tr<0xC3><0xB3>tti in Iceland.
“When I came to Iceland, I didn’t play in the middle like I used to play.
The team’s team was in that position, but he also had the trust number I wanted so I didn’t get any of what I wanted,” says Tonny, who played on the right edge of the season with IBV.
Among the things Tonny talks about is the racism he suffered in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players face when they play in Europe.
“It happened to me once, but since I didn’t understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Later I heard about it and asked my friend what it was all about.
He then told me that my opponent had left a racist comment about me after I harassed him."
In 2014, Tonny travelled from Iceland to Norway where he joined Haugesund.
He said he has made the mistakes he sees the most.
Tonny had not managed to get into the starting team at Haugesund but he wanted to play more to get into the national team.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland on loan, but he joined Val.
“It was a mistake to come back to Iceland on loan.
I think that if I had been in Norway longer, I would have had the opportunity that I wanted to get," says Tonny, but he hoped that if he would play well in Norway, he would probably come further.
He wants to mean that the loan to Iceland has made out of his dreams of getting to the big city in Europe.
Find a snake in a woman's throat
A doctor at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found 3.8 cm long black snake in the neck of a woman who was looking for it.
The doctor was able to pull the snake out with a tong.
The study revealed that there was talk of parasites.
CNN explains this.
The woman had eaten sashimi a few days before, which are thin meat cuts.
The woman recovered quickly after the snake was removed, but parasites such as these are often in raw meat or fish.
After sushi moved to bed in the West, cases where parasites have entered people have increased, according to CNN.
Fear that another wave is starting in Europe
Spain is now on fire in connection with concerns about the second wave of the coronavirus in Europe, where the government has taken steps to reintroduce the spread of the coronavirus era.
In Catalonia, all the entertainment has been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where infection is increasing.
Other European countries have also taken action to increase the number of infections in Spain, but in the UK everyone has to go to hospital at the time of their return from Spain, like in Norway, and the French have been warned about travelling to Spain.
Smitum is also growing again in France and Germany, where the government is trying to find a balance between the spread of the virus and the resumption of the economy.
However, Europe is well off in comparison to elsewhere in the world, but the incidence of infection worldwide is approaching 300,000 a day, with the highest number of infections in America and South Asia.
Confirmed to be 16 million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University, there are 644 thousand confirmed deaths associated with the virus.
Music works finally get to enjoy themselves to the fullest
In front of Tollh<0xC3><0xBA>si<0xC3><0xB0> in Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k is a large and deep hole.
Above it are men with orange helmets.
There is also a large grave.
And other smaller machines.
The street is closed for traffic.
But the gait is available, and many people are now saving and respecting works of art from millions of mosaic tiles —like they have never seen it before.
Maybe they’ve never seen it before.
At least it didn’t seem like it.
The work has so far been somewhat hidden, right in front of there were parking lots that were always sold.
People parked there, locked the car in a hurry, and then started doing their business in the city centre.
“Living and diverse public spaces” and “advantageous urban spaces” are the guiding principles of the reconstruction of the Safe Street that is currently underway.
The goal is to beautify the area and allow the mosaic work of Ger<0xC3><0xB0>ar Helgad<0xC3><0xB3>ttir at Tollh<0xC3><0xBA>si<0xC3><0xB0>ur to enjoy a better view.
In front of the work there will be a square and where the area lies well with the sun, it is considered suitable as a residence for road users.
The artwork will be described and will now make the material work more enjoyable than before on this 142 square metre surface.
In the area there will also be small "tub sprayers", some kind of water sculpture, which offer a game and provide the area with a certain mystery.
In this way, the improvements are described by Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k City, which is currently being implemented together with Veitum.
The layers of water supply, heat supply and electricity supply will be renewed.
Many of them have come to their years, but the schools and cold water laws date back to 1925 and have served residents and businesses in the city centre for nearly a century.
When the road is reopened, cars can drive around it again.
However, it will become a one-way street and at the same time create more quiet and accessible spaces for walking.
In a talk about Tollh<0xC3><0xBA>si<0xC3><0xB0> on the website of the customs manager says that the house was put into use in 1971, whose architect was G<0xC3><0xAD>sli Halld<0xC3><0xB3>rsson.
As a result of the harbour damage reaching through the house, 250 square meters of windowless walls were formed out onto the street.
The building committee and the architect agreed that such surfaces would have a bad effect on the overall streetscape, if no special measures had been taken to adorn the appearance of the house.
The parties therefore agreed to calculate by having a permanent work of art set up there.
During this time, a lot of words came from the artist’s daughter, Ger<0xC3><0xB0> Helgad<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, said in the summary.
She had worked extensively in music in Germany and abroad.
The intention was to contact her first before deciding whether to enter into competition for the work.
It had often been discussed that the work needed to reflect life at the port, because the port had been the lifeblood of Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k since it was made.
When talking to the artist, she had to trace the concept of such a work.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before she leaves the country, where she would work on the proposals abroad.
She was given the time she decided she needed, and when she returned home, she made some suggestions for discussion.
She was immediately asked to do the work.
It was also requested to make a comprehensive agreement with her and the famous art company in Germany, the brothers Oidtmann, but Gerd had long worked with them on the installation of famous works of art across Europe.
The contract was signed and the work was completed under the installation of the workshop of the brothers, who then saw the installation at Tollh<0xC3><0xBA>si<0xC3><0xB0>.
All the work was very well solved by hand, both by the kind of Helgad<0xC3><0xB3>ttir and Oidtmann brothers, says in the summary.
Ever since then, it has been an unsightly Icelandic weather.
It took Gerd about two years to work the work, which was worked and set up in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after Tollh<0xC3><0xBA>sverket was completed, only 47 years old.
Subsidiary transport of more institutions out to the land
<0xC3><0x81>smundur Einar Da<0xC3><0xB0>ason, Minister of Social Affairs, has announced that more public institutions will be transferred to Iceland soon.
This was stated by the Minister in the explosives show on the Wave at lunchtime.
It was recently announced that the fire department of the Housing and Civil Engineering Institute will be moved north to Sau<0xC3><0xB0><0xC3><0xA1>rkrok this autumn.
Six experts in the field of firefighting work at the institute, but none of them intend to follow the institute north, and the Landsverband firefighters and ambulances have criticised the livestock transport.
“I think we need to take a step further in this process.
I’m preparing more steps in this process.
"A lot more traffic," said Asmund.
He says he is convinced that the vast majority of the nation wants to see more distribution of public institutions around the country.
“I think it is necessary to make further political decisions about the transfer of public employment abroad, just as I was doing with the Housing and Construction Agency,” said <0xC3><0x81>smundur, but he also took an example of other institutions that have been transferred abroad and shared a great deal of importance for communities abroad, such as the Transfer of Food Agency to Iceland.
All the best from the second day of the championship
94. Iceland’s free sport championship ended today at <0xC3><0x9E><0xC3><0xB3>rsvellir in Akureyri.
Some of the matches were held on the second day of the competition.
An exciting competition in women’s throws was calculated on <0xC3><0x9E><0xC3><0xB3>rsvellir, while Vigd<0xC3><0xAD>s J<0xC3><0xB3>nsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir from FH put <0xC3><0x8D>slandsmet in throws in 2014 which lasted until El<0xC3><0xAD>sabet Rut R<0xC3><0xBA>narsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir from IR added the rating in May last year.
Vigd<0xC3><0xAD>s won <0xC3><0x8D>slandsmittet back earlier this summer and has been in fantaform up to the last, but she has tripled <0xC3><0x8D>slandsmittet what is of summer.
Elizabeth Ruth has been struggling with injury and has not made it to the finish line today.
She had only one valid throw of five, threw 25.69 meters, which is far from her best.
Vigd<0xC3><0xAD>s threw the furthest of all today, or 60.08 meters in her last attempt and immediately countered.
Her ice cap she put earlier in July is 62.69 meters and she was, however, somewhat from it.
Gudrun Kar<0xC3><0xAD>tas Hallgr<0xC3><0xAD>msd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir from IR had the second best throw of the day, but she improved her best performance with a throw of up to 50.18 meters.
In the men's category, the FH-ing Hilmar <0xC3><0x96>rn J<0xC3><0xB3>nsson, <0xC3><0x8D>slandsmethafi in a throw-in, won a safe victory, but he threw 73.84 meters in his next throw and countered.
His Icelandic score in the article is 75.26 meters.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>ni Valur Gu<0xC3><0xB0>nason, the Olympian and Icelandic broadcasters, won a competition in a ball game at <0xC3><0x9E><0xC3><0xB3>rsvellir yesterday, but today he competed in a broadcast that is his main subject.
<0xC3><0x8D>slandsmet Gu<0xC3><0xB0>na Vals is 65.53 meters, but he threw the longest 59.13 meters today and secured the victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw the next time today, but he had one valid throw that was in second place, 49.43 meters.
Hafd<0xC3><0xAD>s Sigur<0xC3><0xB0>ard<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, <0xC3><0x8D>slandsmethafi in a long pole, won the long jump competition with superiority, but Hafd<0xC3><0xAD>s jumped the longest 6.25 meters today, which is almost 40 cm from her <0xC3><0x8D>slandsmeti.
In the 200-metre race of women, it was the IR-ing Gu<0xC3><0xB0>björg J<0xC3><0xB3>na Bjarnad<0xC3><0xB3>ttir who was the most vocal, but she reached the mark in 24.04 seconds, but her Icelandic score in the article is 23.45 seconds.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>björg J<0xC3><0xB3>na was a winner in Akureyri, winning two gold prizes yesterday, in a 100-metre run and in a 4 x 100-metre relay run and then also in a 4 x 400-metre relay run today.
In the men's category, Kolbeinn Hö<0xC3><0xB0>ur Gunnarsson from FH was the first in the 200 metres race in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of <0xC3><0x93>liver M<0xC3><0xA1>na Sam<0xC3><0xBA>elss<0xC3><0xB8>n from <0xC3><0x81>rmann.
Like Gu<0xC3><0xB0>björg J<0xC3><0xB3>na, Kolbeinn Höd won gold in the 100 metres yesterday as well as in the 400 metres race.
Don't get a fine for 27 million kroner Bitcoin harvest
The Supreme Tax Committee has rejected the claim of a tax investigator who claimed a fine over a person for depreciating his financial income due to the sale of bitcoin.
The committee concluded that the tax investigator had not given a clear explanation as to why it was necessary to punish the man.
The committee’s ruling states that the tax investigator considered the person to be subject to materially incorrect tax returns for the 2016 and 2017 income years.
He had depreciated his capital gains due to the sale of bitcoin to 27 million, either intentionally or through magnificent negligence.
Blame the man for his behavior.
The man refused to do so in a letter to the committee.
In 2016, he sold electricity for $27 million.
Hana would have acquired him with a graveyard in 2009 and 2010, when this would have been both easy and inexpensive with a regular home computer.
Then he pointed out that when he sold the electric coin, tax execution due to such a sale would have been significantly unclear and unpredictable.
It could have been expected that ordinary citizens would have been aware of such measures on tax returns.
He had not intended to avoid paying taxes on the crop and had reported his property on a contribution as a deposit on the currency account.
He would have asked both experts and government tax officials about how this would be done but without success.
Then he thought he needed to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he began to dig for Bitcoin.
He would therefore have been in a worse position than others to introduce complex rules that the tax authorities would not have formed a clear view of.
The man therefore considered right that his taxes for these two years of income would be re-determined and charged but otherwise not made a penalty.
He then reiterated that he liked Iceland and had paid taxes here in Iceland since 2012.
He had never intended to get away from his duties in an improper manner.
The demand for a fine was out of all proportion and would cast him into debt.
“This Man Knows What Football Is” by Brynj<0xC3><0xB3>lfur
Brynj<0xC3><0xB3>lfur Andersen Willumsson has been very much between the teeth of people, but also attracted attention because of his performance what is of the season with Brei<0xC3><0xB0>ablik in the Pepsi Max division.
Lightning will be in the line of fire tonight when they receive IA in a live broadcast on Stage 2 Sport.
Brynj<0xC3><0xB3>lfur then takes out a ban on playing due to four reminders of the season and therefore does not appear to play with a new haircut as in the summer games so far.
He had written "bla, bla, bla" on his head for the game at HK last Thursday, which HK won 1-0.
“I don’t know who exactly he was answering with the payment, but talking about the character, this one was better to try in the game.
He did not hide.
He wants to get the ball every single time and if there was anyone going to equalize this game, I thought he would do it or create it," Gu<0xC3><0xB0>mundur Benediktsson told the Pepsi Max team, when it was thought that Brynj<0xC3><0xB3>lf.
“I have to be here for the people.”
“It’s hard to know where he is.
He looks a little out on the left when it starts to feel like the game, but he has a very free role in the team," Hjörvar Haflikason said.
Thorkell M<0xC3><0xA1>ni Pétursson says Brynj<0xC3><0xB3>lf is a real entertainer and is pleased to have such a colorful man in the department: “No one shares that this is a character.
This is a fun type and I love this with my hair, and to always be ready to meet and respond in interviews.
There are a lot of people who tell me that this guy knows what football is.
“I am a fun person.
I want to be here for people and enjoy it.”
People are reading the interviews with Brynj<0xC3><0xB3>lf, people are paying in and watching what is next on his hair.
This man is just a genius," said Moon.
Player KR says he wants to leave the club - "I've been in contact with a few teams in the B-team"
Tobias Thomsen, player KR in the Pepsi Max Division, appears to be leaving the team.
According to the Danish media Bold, Tobias is ready to return home to Denmark.
Football.net also reported on the matter.
Tobias wants to get to the start of the season in his home country, but for this he must first cancel his contract with KR, where the Danish division starts before that Icelandic probability.
The company knows that I miss Denmark and has shown me a lot of understanding," Tobias said in a conversation with Bold.
“I’ve been in contact with a few teams in the B division and will probably switch over before the Icelandic season ends.
There are not many teams in Denmark that can afford to pay my contract with KR."
Then he says that he probably needs to take on a wage reduction in Denmark.
“Farmers in Denmark have probably found more for the economic impact of the virus than in Iceland.”
Bike driver Bjartmar has recovered bikes for millions - Reply now to review DV
For over a year, Bjartmar Le<0xC3><0xB3>sson has had an interest unlike most others.
He opens the door and saves lost and stolen bicycles, bicycles and scooters.
Bjartmar has earned the name “the bike driver” for the week.
Yesterday, there was a lot of confusion when you posted a story about your relationship with Bjartmar.
DV then referred to the discussion on the Facebook group Vesturb<0xC3><0xA6>ninga, where it was revealed that Bjartmar had taken the man on a speech at Austurvellir and said the wallet might be stolen.
There was nothing else that could be read from the original writings of the electrician but that Bjartmar had deceived him.
The text has now been changed on Facebook and the headline of the original news DV updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says the initial news of the case is not at all descriptive of what actually happened yesterday at Austurvellir.
Bjartmar said he had received information from the victim of electrocution wool that these were indeed his electrocutions.
The information was sent to the owner, but the information was found to be incorrect, says Bjartmar.
“I looked at the guy and I looked at the shuttle, and there was information that there was an electric shuttle that had been missing for a very long time and was looking for it.
I certainly hesitated at first, but when I saw him prepare to drive on the shuttle I decided to stop by to talk to the man.
The owner was sure of his fault and I decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general, I am very good at such a thing, but before I finished what I had to say, the man had taken from me the word.”
Bjartmar says that the man on the electric scooter has just as invited him to show him the receipt for the bike and has himself called the police.
"Yeah, great," said Bjartmar, "let's just get this straight."
Then the owner of the electric scooter proved ownership of his electric scooter and started.
Later, the right owner of the electric scooter told his story on Facebook, as reported in the previous news.
Over the course of this year, Bjartmar has spent some time in his practice, saying he can count the time he encountered people on other hands.
“I have had peaceful relations with the most difficult people in Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k,” said Bjartmar, pointing out that bikers are the longest-serving smallest brothers and sisters in the community, fools, insane people and other people who are on the streets for some reason.
“The drug is a tough master and somehow needs to finance the next dose, because unfortunately, theft of such loose funds is an easy way to achieve that goal,” says Bjartmar.
“My relationship with these people is really so good that I have come with a lot of the good people in my team.
“There are examples of people taking treatment and looking for me and helping me with what I’m doing,” he said.
In general, Bjartmar’s communication with cyclists is on a polite note.
Some people know about him and what he is doing and offer him peace of mind to show him the receipts, the wheel number and so on.
Cycling is a big problem that little has been addressed.
Furthermore, Bjartmar says that the police are even starting to point people to talk to him out of stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar disagrees with the previous DV news release and says he is not a self-directed police officer in a personal search for justice.
Asked if he is now not on the ice with his performance, and whether this is not the first and foremost role of the police, Bjartmar says so certainly be.
“Of course the police have to do this, but the fact of the matter is that the police are not doing this.
I’ve been looking up at police officers driving away from a huge pile of stolen wheels.
She’s clearly speechless in these matters.”
“When the police are not doing anything about this, and this is just in front of your nose, and the experience has shown that I can succeed in this class, then why not?” asks Bjartmar.
He says he has achieved so much success in having up on stolen bikes, that sometimes he runs on his “shoes” on the street that then they just got the right Bjartmari bikes they had previously made.
The times that Bjartmar has called for the help of the police have come that she does not quite meet.
“It’s just not working with the police, and it’s not my fault and it’s not the owners of the bikes to blame,” said Bjartmar, and it’s a pity that victims of bicycle theft need to feel for the integrity of the police in this class.
Bjartmar's performance is not shared.
You can find stories of people thanks Bjartmari for having brought their possessions back to them.
Bjartmar has long lost the number of bicycles he has returned, but the amounts run on millions, if not millions.
There, electric scooters, electric scooters and electric scooters weigh heavily, but electric scooters can cost less than half a million dollars.
Bjartmar works in kindergarten on a day to day basis and every other weekend he works in a community.
His bike search is therefore unpaid work that he does in his free time.
Lifebloods and long shadows
In 2019 there was a big birthday year in the history of pension funds in Iceland.
Officials had, of course, been remunerated from the king of Denmark all the streets from the 19th century, but in 1919 the pension fund was set up by officials who eventually became the pension fund of all public servants.
The basis for the current pension funds of general wage earners was then laid down by universal collective bargaining in the labour market in 1969, which provided for employment-related pension funds with compulsory membership and a valid fund collection from the year 1970.
In 1974, laws were enacted on the basis of these agreements and the pension system continued to increase after that.
The wage system was not the only radical change that the labour movement of the 20th century pushed forward with its drive.
In 1955, unemployment insurance had been treated in a similar way in a history-based incident, and the association also gradually met its demands for health rights and health insurance, substantial holiday entitlements, a reduction in working hours, improvements in housing, and more.
All of these rights cost a great and austere struggle, but proved, after all, a far greater and more lasting cure than the increase in the number of aurics in the labour market, which disappeared as hard as the inflation rate which characterized the post-war period until 1990, as many remember.
The contribution to the establishment of general pension funds in 1969 was both long and complex.
While people eventually came together to see that the funds were actually owned by fund companies, the labour movement had to fall to the fact that their board of directors was ordered by representatives of employers and fund companies alike.
In the coming years after the foundation of the funds, the demand for the majority of employees in the fund’s board of directors often came to a discussion in the employees’ association, but it was never achieved, and therefore we are still sitting up with the abnormal arrangement that the members of the fund’s board of directors are not in the majority.
Article 36 of Act No. 129/1997 on the compulsory insurance of pension rights and the activities of pension funds deals with the investment policy of the funds.
In paragraph 1, it states that ‘the pension fund shall have the interests of the members of the fund as a guiding principle.’
The fifth paragraph also states: ‘The UCITS shall set ethical criteria in investments.’
The shareholders’ policy of the Traders’ Pension Fund includes, inter alia, the following provisions, in addition to the aforementioned legal provisions:
The Pension Fund is a member of the United Nations (UN PRI) rules on responsible investment, along with many of the largest pension funds and professional investors in the West Bank and in Europe.
The rules discuss how the emphasis on environmental and social issues as well as good governance-driven companies can contribute to the improvement of investment performance of portfolios.
This brings together the interests of investors and the goals of society in a broader context.
LV considers it important that companies, in particular those listed on the stock market, adopt a public policy on: to pursue good governance in terms of social responsibility and environmental issues.
The National Pension Fund, which has the largest funds in the country, has set itself a “policy on responsible investments” and there are provisions of a similar nature.
This is all recorded here as an entrance to the latest fashion word of Icelandic, “shadow management”.
Since the word is used in the case, it is not expected that it has been defined to end, but the following definition now seems to me to be "most taken": Shadow management is that when a leader in a trade union says in the media that he intends to send the representatives of the company to the board of the pension fund recommendations or instructions on how to take a stand in a given case.
If they do not comply with the recommendations, they will be removed from the board at the first opportunity.
If the leader doesn’t do this in the media and doesn’t talk about resignation, however, it’s not “shadow management” because, of course, there is always communication between people in the financial world like elsewhere.
I'll let the reader think about how he feels "shady."
In particular, there are two people who have tried to shape this definition when it is written, in the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.
They are Hör<0xC3><0xB0>ur <0xC3><0x86>gisson's journalist on the Newspaper and <0xC3><0x81>sgeir J<0xC3><0xB3>nsson's central bank manager.
Both parties were nominated after Bogi Nils Bogason, the CEO of Icelandair, had announced their intention to terminate the company’s agreements with air carriers and air traffic controllers (discontinue them), and Ragnar <0xC3><0x9E><0xC3><0xB3>r Ing<0xC3><0xB3>lfsson, the chairman of the Icelandic Association of Trade Unions, sent these recommendations to the members of the company’s board of directors.
Some time later, Bogi Nils withdrew his decision and afterwards Ragnar Thor went the same route with his recommendation, which, of course, referred to Boga’s decision.
Nevertheless, they saw Hör<0xC3><0xB0>ur and <0xC3><0x81>sgeir reason to raise the issue in Friday’s newsletter with big words about shadow management, law enforcement and the rich need for changes to the law.
There, a small dove really had to overturn a heavy load although the blessed dove would have been in a connection mode and also had to be wiped out quickly.
Since the matter is important, let us consider the matter itself at the end.
I have read about the provisions of the law on pensions that apply to this matter.
These include that fund managers should take care of the interests of fund-holders and have ethical criteria in investments, and these points are elaborated in more detail in both the Gildis and the Merchants' Pension Fund as I mentioned.
However, pension funds should NOT look only for short-term dividends in their investments.
Such would be a very dangerous policy and need not look for long to judge such a thing in the past, as large loans from banks and funds have turned into immoral adventurers and environmentalists, with disastrous consequences.
The CEO of Icelandair was obviously on the ice when he thought of wiping out a whole group of employees, thus significantly reducing the goodwill that the company has enjoyed on the Icelandic market and weakening its position towards investors.
Fortunately, he saw it and pulled it back.
Time shows whether it is sufficient for the investment of pension funds in the company to be held responsible to the fund companies when they are up.

One of the infected did not have a home remedy.
One of the three people diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country yesterday came to the country from the Baltic States on July 15, about a week and a half ago.
He is an Icelander who is not living here as usual and therefore did not receive clear instructions to carry out the so-called "homecoming permit" after his arrival in Iceland and go to another sampling a few days after his arrival.
He had a negative view of the border.
“But he is in an Icelandic society and really should go to that resort,” says Kamilla J<0xC3><0xB3>sepsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, an expert in the field of prevention at Landl<0xC3><0xA4>kn and a stagnant doctor during his summer vacation, in a conversation with the newspaper today.
“He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the identification number and if the identification number is not registered then you are not automatically offered in the second sample.”
She says that the man could have used the English registration form because he is actually residing abroad but because of his connection in the country as an Icelandic he should have used it Icelandic.
But he didn’t realize this.
“When the identification is not recorded, you have to search for it yourself to arrive at the second sampling.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realized that this would be the right way,” Kamilla says.
“So it is clear that we need to enhance the information on this while we find some way to make an automated preaching system even though Icelanders do not register their ID numbers.
Or to make it somehow more obvious who are participants in the Icelandic community in the registration system," she explains.
Fortunately, the person concerned does not get along with the arrival to the country even though he is defined as a participant in the Icelandic community, the remaining Icelander.
Only six have been sent to hospital after he was diagnosed yesterday and these six were all in contact with him.
They are going to be sampled, but two of them are beginning to show signs of Covid-19 infection.
The man received a negative from his sampling at the border on 15 July.
Kamilla probably says that he had recently been infected by the virus that she had not yet been able to detect it when the sample was taken at the border.
However, she does not want to exclude that the man has been infected here in Iceland, but does not carry the virus with him to the country.
“It’s not quite possible to say that this is certainly an imported infection because it’s been a long time since he came to the country that he might have been exposed here like these two that have caused a little bit of control in connection with the sports tournament.”
She says it’s very unlikely because of how many people are around her.
“It’s really very unlikely,” Kamilla says, but notes that it can’t be excluded until Icelandic genetic analysis has sequenced the virus in man.
“If we get a virus that hasn’t been seen here before, it’s almost certain he’s brought it to the country.”
Piper sprays and explosives used against protesters
There were clashes between police and protesters in Seattle last night.
Police used pipe spray and unbanned handcuffs, but protesters broke down and ignited.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were injured.
Police violence and racial prejudice were protested in the United States last night, but protests in Seattle were in support of protesters in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one protestor was shot dead.
As the BBC reports, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands gathered in peaceful protests.
A group of people then woke up in a building site and broke a bus in the city's courthouse.
Subsequently, police said the protest was unfounded and there was a conflict between groups of protesters and police.
In Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black man who was murdered by police in August of last year, was at least one of the protesters.
The car went through a group of protesters in the city but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of guards came together and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was murdered by police at her home last March.
The group carried firearms and went to a closed street meeting where police related the group from a group of people who protested the protests and also carried firearms.
Then 75 were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters recalled James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man who was murdered by a white barista in May.
Sunlight: Not the game that defines our season
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Manchester United football manager, doesn’t want to make too much of the importance of Leicester today in the final round of the English Premier League.
If United lose the game, and Chelsea do not lose to Wolves, Solskjaer and his men finish in 5th place and thereby lose to the Champions League seat.
However, they should still hope to get to the Champions League by winning the European League next month.
“We’re not at the end.
“If we get to a level against Leicester, I think people will say we haven’t had a bad time,” Solskjaer said.
“But whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey because we still have a lot of land to reach the teams above us,” Solskjaer said.
It is clear that the nerves of the men will be there at 3 p.m. today, but Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r tried to pretend that every other game was in question.
“If you want to belong to Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
It’s nothing new, and that’s where the company is based.
We have created a great opportunity to end the period well and now it is ours to make use of it,” Solskjaer said.
"It's not the most important game of the season, it's just the next game.
You can ask anyone in the football, the next game is always the most important.
The results do not define our period, we have already had many hours to define this period."
“The arrival of Bruno Fernandes changed a lot for us and I think we are in a better shape and much stronger mentally than in the last period,” Solskjaer said.
65,000 infections per day
65,490 new coronavirus infections were detected in the United States yesterday, according to John Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 infections have been confirmed in the West Sea since the start of the epidemic in Iceland.
900 people died from the virus yesterday, but the last four days until there were more than 1,000 deaths due to the virus.
A total of 146,460 deaths from the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
According to CNN, according to a prediction from the U.S. Department of Defense, the number of deaths caused by the virus will be 175,000 on August 15 next.
Fear the other wave of the beast
Spain’s government is now trying to stop the spread of COVID-19 in the country due to its weakness.
The Spanish health authorities reported over 920 new cases of COVID-19, both on Thursday and Friday.
There, no more have been detected in one day since the beginning of May and come the freckles at the same time as the Spanish begin to abolish one of the strictest exit bans in Europe.
The attack resulted in the British authorities now requiring passengers coming from Spain to go to hospital on arrival.
A week earlier, Spain was on the British list of safe states.
The situation is what is worse in Catalonia in the northeast of Spain, where the government has seized on wider restrictions to try to stem the level of growth.
In the capital city of Barcelona, entertainment venues will be closed for the next two weeks and antique houses will be closed at midnight.
The ban is now in effect for 200,000 residents of Segria County in western Catalonia.
It is believed that the decision of Britain will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which relies heavily on the arrival of foreign tourists and is badly played after the epidemic.
Tui, the UK’s largest travel agency, cancelled all scheduled flights today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Governments around the world are said to be preparing for the second wave of the epidemic, but little interest seems to be in taking back to the extensive ban on exports that has severely destroyed the economy.
Boris Johnson, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, has taken a very bad look at this, similar to a nuclear weapon he does not want to use.
French Prime Minister Jean Castex has said that the nation “would not be able to survive, economically or socially,” if again a national ban on exports would be imposed.
Many officials hope that the local resources that reach the inhabitants of individual towns, cities or areas will be sufficient to hold back the virus in the next round if it comes to it.
Five new infections in Iceland - Three domestic
Three domestic pollutants were detected yesterday as well as two in addition to the border.
Five people with positive Covid-19 infection were diagnosed yesterday in Iceland.
In the announcement of the general public, one infection is related to the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football tournament.
He was sent in solitary confinement and sixteen who were intimately associated with him in sickness.
The infected person was a participant in the social work of a sports club in Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k and, according to the announcement, is “only part of the sports team” in the hospital.
Others who were sent to hospital were connected to the man in a different way.
The origin of this infection is unrecognized and full-time infection in the National Police Department.
Opponents of the ReyCUP have followed the guidelines and rules of the Pharmacovigilance Physician and the public service that are still in force and appropriate measures have been taken.
However, pictures of the tournament attracted attention as it was possible to see in a very close connection to celebrate the good course of his team on the field.
Just before 11 a.m. today, opponents will post the following notice on their Facebook page.
It reads: “ATH: Parents please respect the rules that competitors download their own dot in school.
Parents are not allowed to do that.
Thank you for your understanding.”
Another infection was detected yesterday but is related to the infection reported last day.
The report states: “Icelandic genetic analysis has identified the infection and revealed a new type of virus that has not been detected here before.”
In this case, the infection is also carried out and the person is infected in isolation and 12 in the pathogen due to the infection.
The third infection in question is from a person who arrived in Iceland 11 days ago, 15 July.
It was located on the southwest corner of the country.
He is now in solitary confinement and six who were in close contact with him in sickness.
Two of them are already showing signs of viral infection.
In addition, two at the border were identified and the results of further research such as a cross-border infection procedure are expected.
Finally, the announcement states: The Directorate of Public Prosecution and the Ministry of Health urge people to take care and take care of individual infectious agents.
If the symptoms of the Covid-19 virus are present, the same person is asked to take a sample at the nearest health centre.
Patreksfjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur says camp site booked on shopping weekend - Direct visitors other
The camp site at Patreksfjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur is booked during the weekend, according to the Westbygg<0xC3><0xB0>ur report.
Guests are advised to check out other accommodations.
Names Westbygg<0xC3><0xB0> B<0xC3><0xAD>ldudal, T<0xC3><0xA1>lknafjör<0xC3><0xB0>, Melanes <0xC3><0xA1> Rau<0xC3><0xB0>asandi, Hotel Fl<0xC3><0xB3>kalund and Hotel Brei<0xC3><0xB0>av<0xC3><0xAD>k as other options in the position.
There is plenty to be at Patreksfjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur this weekend, because as in previous years Skjaldborg, the festival of Icelandic documentary films will be held in the town.
It has been held since 2007 and has become a strong tradition in the city.
Due to an appeal in the camping area to judge, you can expect a good meeting this year, if the weather does not put a stick in the account, but DV said earlier today from a derailed forecast.
However, we can expect the worst weather in the south, and hope for Patreksfjör<0xC3><0xB0>ir.
The web bb.is first said, and said that all other lodgings in the town were already fully booked.
Entirely multi-storey caverns down to the best place in the city
Romanian workers live free at Dunhaga 18–20.
In the meantime, owners are applying for a building permit for renovation, but their business has been chosen in the system for the third year.
In one of the oldest, greenest and most expensive districts of Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k, there is a spacious multi-family house on three floors.
On the ground floor of the house is about 600 square meters of shopping space.
Behind the house are the doors of two staircases, each of which holds four fairly spacious apartments.
They range from 93 to 130 square meters, but most are over 100.
The house has a great history to keep.
It was built in 1959 and has hosted video games, Sk<0xC3><0xB3>stofuna, the milk shop Mj<0xC3><0xB3>lkursamsölinn, J<0xC3><0xB3>a gunsmith, fish sales and now the last University print.
The house has, so easily said, remembered its ugly beauty.
The house is now under great damage, as can be seen in the accompanying pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
The owners D18 ehf. are according to the company register including Magn<0xC3><0xBA>s Magn<0xC3><0xBA>sson and Gu<0xC3><0xB0>r<0xC3><0xBA>n Helga L<0xC3><0xA1>rusd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir.
Magn<0xC3><0xBA>s joined the Borgunar ownership group and was the defender of Borgunar’s holding company.
St<0xC3><0xA1>lskip ehf is part of the group of owners of the ownership company Borgunar.
St<0xC3><0xA1>lskip ehf. is the investment company Gu<0xC3><0xB0>r<0xC3><0xBA>n Helgu L<0xC3><0xA1>rusd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir and her children.
Gudrun is also the owner of a third of the shares in D18 ehf.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>r<0xC3><0xBA>n and her husband, August Gu<0xC3><0xB0>mundur Sigur<0xC3><0xB0>sson, once executed the steel ship.
D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and has so little that nothing has been kept since then.
Tell the neighbors that the condition of the house has deteriorated steadily since then, though mostly in recent years.
On Facebook, one of the residents in the neighborhood said the house had “not been particularly lively in recent years.”
This may mean that the owners have spent a few years trying to change the house and the plot.
Other neighbors say the house has not been well for a long time.
"It's a long time to do something general with this stain and it's boring that it's pulled like this."
He also says that he is a fool in the owners of the house for not having ventured to finish this, found some common ground with the neighbors of the house and stopped this “legal loss”.
“Just do this in consultation with the community around you so you can move on and finish it.”
The “legal step” referred to by the resident is the organizational process of the field that has been running since at least 2017.
Then the owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 were searched for permission to build a hill on top of the existing multi-storey house and behind the house, a new lift house and an annex on one floor as well as a basement.
The building permit granted for the implementation was submitted to the Environmental and Resource Court and the Committee repealed it, since the implementation was not part of a divisional structure and the notification of the merger was not satisfactory.
The city of Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k then started with a divisional work and ended it with an advertisement in the Official Journal in July of last year.
That plan was also appealed and the committee repealed it in March 2020.
At this point, almost three years had passed since the initial application for a building permit and the owners of the house at the start of the field.
At that time, the house had fallen down considerably and the neighbors were getting tired.
When DV asked the neighbors out into the situation and the reactions of the neighbors, the answers were in various ways.
Some had an understanding of the intentions of the owners of the house, others not at all.
Others were angry at the city, others not.
Others were angry, but none of them were.
Others said the parking lot was a hassle, but the neighbors have used the unused parking space Dunhaga 18–20 under their vehicles.
A friend of mine said long-suffering in the administration:
“The fact that we have to go through the process of tripping is incredible.
It's like the city of Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k can't read."
Today the house is empty, abandoned and neglected.
A reminder of the city’s floating administrative system and the noble intentions of the owner and the years of work of those who are now on the starting line.
When the journalist carried a garden on Dunhagar 18, he blew open the door and a trash can.
Playstation computers and recent TVs were located within the second debris on the planet —the victims of Icelandic summer heatsinks.
It was opened in the old office of the University Printing Office, where a large number of cats of the lantern were to be judged.
It is clear that someone has touched himself in one corner, but no one is visible.
Stables of sofas and beds and a number of geological pages, which were probably to become a book, were blown away.
The apartments were also open and both of them were alive.
The reporter was so lucky to be able to meet the other people.
There were Romanians cooking a potato dish for dinner and invited a journalist in.
The Romanians work for Ztrongforce ehf.
They have been there for some time and rehearsed the sources DV that the company has paid nothing for the household except heat and electricity.
Due to the condition of the house, it is not advisable to collect the rent.
It is clear that there have been a lot of foreign workers in recent losses due to mails in the front door of the house.
The operation of employee leasing has not taken advantage of the Covid-19 situation, as the contraction in tourism leads to a contraction in the construction industry and these two industries are what it takes to make use of employee leasing services.
Nevertheless, householders at Dunhaga 18 seemed to have had enough to do and held the work gallows and the co-owners for thirst after a long working day in the rain.
It should be noted that, despite the terrible condition of the house, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be well maintained.
When a journalist spoke to the boys in Romanian, he suddenly became clear: At the best place in Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k, 1,500 square meters of real estate stands low.
Owners want to change the house for improvement and neighbors want to improve the condition but share the definition of “betted”.
In between, the planning area of the city sits at the beginning of the field, the victim of endless appeals and the possibility of appeals in the planning process and the so-called “Swiphase” resolution of the Committee on the Environment and Natural Resources.
In the house there are such Romanian workers, perhaps just those who are going to improve the situation, when the Icelanders stop fighting.
The article was originally published in the July 17th issue of the Holy See.
In the fight against obesity following the Coronavirus Age
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will provide <0xC2><0xA3>10 million in a campaign against obesity, which will include a ban on fast-paced advertising, following his serious weakness, in part due to his weight.
Johnson says the campaign, which has been called Better Health, will be presented tomorrow, Monday, but with the campaign, doctors will be encouraged to prescribe cycling for their skiers in excess weight and will also be engaged in a campaign to increase the number of cycling days.
In addition, commercials on TV will be banned before 21:00 in the evening, according to British media sources.
“COVID-19 has alerted us to the short- and long-term risks of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined that we need to use time to become healthier, more active and eat healthier foods,” the government said in a statement.
Johnson himself has been involved in weight problems, but he was hospitalized for a thorough examination when he was infected by the coronavirus in the spring, and it is in part for his weight because he is thought to have been so seriously ill.
Women are better at leading the change.
She said that the new constitution was the biggest step that the nation can take towards greater distribution of power, transparency and the fight against corruption and the interests of the whole.
“We need to change gear a little now and who is better off leading such changes than the group of society that is easier to be in these values.
“There are women,” Helga said.
“Women in Iceland are famous for their women’s unity.
To stand together and be together in leading change.
So now it’s time for us to make these changes.”
She said she was a little concerned about Iceland’s emphasis as “best in the world” in both gender equality and human rights.
“We’re not ready to see what needs to be done.
Like the Germans, they are very aware of their history and look at everything that needs to be done.
It's a lot.
We need to know where we are coming from and know the story and listen.
Listen to the voices of the outcasts.
“We don’t have the same rules here,” Helga said.
In many ways, she said that women are in good health in Iceland, but added that, like elsewhere, Icelanders build with a very masculine value.
She said that politics turned to form its own interests, powers, and powers, which were the forces that sustained injustice in all societies.
“Women are now starting this group and coming together and are just getting a little bit annoyed that Althing is going to pull a move to look past this 2012 referendum,” she said.
“That’s the kind of woman we’re thinking about.
From human rights and nature conservation, cooperation and that we are all really sitting at the same table," she said, adding that the above values were the basic values of the new Constitution.
“We are a very rich country of natural resources and it is ridiculous that there are people living in poverty here.
It’s ridiculous, we can change things differently,” Helga said.
“It is ridiculous that there is a natural law that women’s needs are always lower paid.
It’s ridiculous that air traffic controllers and nurses have to stand in a constant struggle just to get decent wages.”

Trying to rob pedestrians in the city centre
A man was arrested in the city centre the night after he threatened pedestrians and tried to get money from him.
The police also stopped the production of drugs in <0xC3><0x81>rb<0xC3><0xA6>r, where two were arrested for the case.
Then the police stopped the motorcyclist in Hl<0xC3><0xAD>den, where his driver was at a speed of 146 km where the maximum speed is 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been deprived of driving rights.
The police in the capital area had enough to turn last night and over 80 cases were recorded in the police diary from five yesterday to five this morning.
There was a lot of talk about noise.
On Saturday morning, reports of eleven noisy clashes were received, and it was widely considered in the police diary.
Last night, however, there were 22 noises on board the police.
Six people were in jail last night.
In <0xC3><0x81>rb<0xC3><0xA6>r, police were called to the night when parties shot fireworks on the air.
However, they had already escaped when police officers were taking to the park.
Then nine drivers were stopped for accumulating and or drug driving.
Four were arrested for fighting in the city centre last night, one of whom was kept in a prison cell.
Then two were moved to an emergency room after they fell on their faces, one in the city centre and the other in the Western City.
One was transferred to an accident ward after he was injured in jumping on a trampoline in Kopavogur.
In addition, police officers stopped the driver who drove a caravan in Kjalarnes yesterday.
According to the police diary, the caravan’s equipment was in “very bad condition” and it was stationary.
You can stay in Monet's house for business stays
The house, in which the impressionist Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his practice, is now available for rent on the Airbnb website.
The next free night in the house is about the shopping weekend.
The house is small and quaint, located in the town of Givenry in Normandy, France.
The painter lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
In the house there are three bedrooms, two lounges and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint his gardens famous in this house.
If someone wants to rent the house, they must rent at least two nights.
Considering the Airbnb page, it’s next free after a week, on Sunday of the shopping weekend, and therefore might be ideal for some traders on vacation to venture into booking the painter’s house.
The two nights over a shopping weekend cost only 964 U.S. dollars or just over 130,000 Icelandic kroner as soon as the newsletter arrives.
Tens of people with STDs and several of them begin to show symptoms of the disease caused by the coronavirus
Five have been diagnosed with the coronavirus domestically in the last three days and most of the infected are unrelated.
Tens of people are infected with this disease and some of them begin to show signs of the disease that the virus causes.
Three were identified with the Coronavirus domestically yesterday and two with border screening.
An expert at the Department of Health says that increasing numbers of domestic infections do not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading widely in the community.
“There’s been a series of reports from the former domestic community and it’s a virus that hasn’t been seen here before so we don’t have any particular reason to think it’s been hidden in the community for some time.
This is probably something that has recently arrived in the country, but of course we need to be very well guarded now," said Kamilla Sigr<0xC3><0xAD><0xC3><0xB0>ur J<0xC3><0xB3>sefsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, an expert in the field of protection of the land doctor.
Most of these infections have been associated with individuals who came from abroad.
Further sampling will take place in the near future, but some who were in contact with the infected have begun to show the symptoms of the coronavirus.
“Now there’s no flu going on and less about other respiratory infections so we can be pretty liberal in doing this test for individuals who in the flu season would have found a reason to do something else first,” Kamilla said.
Saturation is mostly complete, but it is not ruled out that more people need to go to the hospital.
Two of the infected were diagnosed after attending a sports event.
Have you ever wondered if it is possible to hold such an event?
The general public’s communications manager says it well as long as people follow the criteria and rules.
Kamilla says almost impossible that the infected have been infected at the sports tournaments.
“If there is no more isolation from these individuals after they have interacted with them at this sporting event, we can argue that our prevention of these events has worked.
But that has not been revealed," said Kamilla.
The Ministry of Social Affairs is in constant review.
“We need to be prepared to intervene with further recommendations or restrictions if there seems to be a reason,” Kamilla said.
Within a week, the number of restrictions will be increased to a thousand people.
This new position could affect seizures.
"Decided meditation to cook" - See the menu of El<0xC3><0xAD>sa Vi<0xC3><0xB0>ar
El<0xC3><0xAD>sa Vi<0xC3><0xB0>arsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir is a performance performer in the football team and plays with Val.
She is also a master of nutrition, a mother, and works as a food scientist.
She needs a lot of energy for the day and usually gives herself time to cook good and nutritious food.
My usual day starts when I get to work from eight,” says Elisha.
“After work, I go to the store to prepare dinner before I bring my girl to school at about three o’clock.”
Elisa feels very nutritious to bring her daughter to school early.
“It’s nice to have some time with her before I go to practice the second part.
After exercise, it is good to come home and just need to warm up the food.
In the evening, when the girl is asleep, we like to watch one part to empty the mind.”
Eliza does not follow any particular diet.
She is finishing her master’s degree in nutritionology and knows well what it is like to eat to have enough energy to do work, school, family and exercises.
“I like to eat a variety of foods that are well-composed of proteins, carbohydrates and fats.
However, I find it most important to have a healthy relationship with food and not classify food into bad or good, rather nutritious or nutritious.
It’s okay to eat everything, just not everything at once and not always.”
Eliza is very interested in cooking.
“I think it’s a good idea to sit in the kitchen and cook a lot.
I have to say that my self-confidence is in the kitchen and I really believe that I am a good cook.”
Breakfast: oats, chia seeds, hemp seeds, salt, a little lemon juice, let lie in almond milk overnight.
Top this meal with whatever it is.
Most often it is a banana and jumps musli & kaffi.
I'm a big coffee maker.
Differences: Unbelievably different, but fruits or vegetables, flatbreads, clean dishes with bananas and musli, bread with spreads and so I could eat humus with a spoon up from the box if that applies.
H<0xC3><0xA1>degismatur: I often prepare all kinds of food-rich salads from what exists in the fridge, quinoa or barley, falafel buns, rock salad, oven-baked vegetables with good dressing is something I’m working with.
If the arrangement goes completely out of the beans (which happens often), then the egg machine at work has come to my rescue quite often and then there are 2 bread slices with butter, cheese and sweetened eggs, don't put any more on you.
Get me something rich in carbohydrates for exercise, bread with an apple, cereal or fruit.
Dinner: Fish will be very often for the choice of my home, otherwise some delicious vegetarian dishes.
Conflicts between police and protesters in Seattle
The Seattle City Council in Washington State has declared an uprising following a number of protests in the city centre.
Yesterday, police seized firecrackers and pipe trots to try to demolish a large area that protesters were subjugating and stretching over many house lengths in the vicinity of the town's parliament house.
The police reported on Twitter that at least 11 protesters had been arrested and that the investigation was about a crime that was committed at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of bomb.
The city and police authorities say that protesters have stoned police with rubble, bottles, riot bombs and other loose and one police officer was transferred to a hospital where his injuries were done.
However, the protests in Seattle were peaceful for a long time.
The blast was to show solidarity to protesters in Portland, Oregon, but there has repeatedly been a fierce clash between protesters and the heavily-armed federal police.
There, as in more cities in the United States, people gather under the umbrella of Black Lives Matter, recalls Georges Floyds, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on May 25, opposing systematic racism in American society and demanding redress.
Do not withdraw until after the vote
It is not yet clear whether the cancellations of Icelandair’s air carriers, which are due to take effect next month, will be revoked.
An electronic vote on Icelandair’s Airfrey Association’s collective agreement on behalf of Icelandair’s airfrey ends at noon tomorrow.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>laug L<0xC3><0xAD>ney J<0xC3><0xB3>hannsd<0xC3><0xB3>ttir, the chairman of the company, is confident that Icelandair will not take a decision on the resignations until the result of the vote is available.
"It's a good thing," said Gu<0xC3><0xB0>laug L<0xC3><0xAD>ney.
“There have been no redundancies, this has to be done in such a way that the machines can be manned.
People are not happy to know if they will be able to get a job after the month.”
The agreement was signed a week ago, on the 19th of July.
It is expected to enter into force by the end of September 2025 and is based on an agreement previously signed by air carriers in a vote.
On 17 July, the Icelandic Airfrey Society’s Board of Directors and the Icelandic Airfrey Society’s Trust Council agreed to announce a full-time cease-fire at Icelandair, the members agreed to it in a vote.
It never came to her, but this was decided following Icelandair’s decision to stop talks with the airline, cancel all its flight attendants and look for contracts with another company.
Then the pilots of the company had to take on the work of the armed forces on board temporarily.
Asked how she thinks the vote will go, Gu<0xC3><0xB0>laug L<0xC3><0xAD>ney says it’s hard to say.
“People are in pain after Icelandair’s arrival, when all the company’s airliners were terminated and announced that the agreement would be with another union.
“It’s going to make a difference,” she says.
At the end of April, 940 Icelandair air passengers were employed by Icelandair, with 900 of them, about 95%, being cancelled.
The deadline for their resignation is not met, for those with the longest period of employment, it is three months and ends on the month of July-August.
There are about 90% of Icelandair’s airliners in this group.
What will happen if the agreement is not approved?
“We would like to continue our discussions with our clients.
With this agreement, we are meeting the requirements of Icelandair.
If he is rejected, it is clear that the airliners have gone too far."
A vote on the agreement ends and Icelandair announces its second quarter settlement tomorrow
Voter turnout for a new airline agreement ends at noon tomorrow morning.
Icelandair’s financial statements for the second quarter will also be published tomorrow, but interim results suggest that the company’s income has decreased by 85 percent from the same period last year.
An electronic vote payment for the Icelandic Airfrey Association’s collective agreement and Icelandair’s association for the economy began on Wednesday, 22 July, and ends tomorrow, Monday, 27 July, at 12 a.m.
Those who may vote for the contract are employees of Icelandair who pay social security contributions to the Flugfreyjufélag.
Icelandair and FF<0xC3><0x8D> signed a new collective agreement on Sunday 19 July, but on Friday before Icelandair had broken off talks with the company after airliners signed a previous agreement in a vote in early July.
Icelandair had then informed all airliners and airline members of the company on Friday, but they were withdrawn after a new collective agreement was signed.
According to a new collective agreement, flight attendants need to fly five hours more per month for the same basic salary.
The nuclear agreement is valid until 2025, where the provisions of pilots and pilots have been integrated for how long a single watch can be operated.
The agreement was presented to FF<0xC3><0x8D> members at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica hotel last Monday and described many flight attendants who spoke to them about their dissatisfaction with the agreement.
However, most seemed to agree that it would be necessary to approve the agreement to keep FFI alive.
Icelandair’s financial statement for the second quarter will be presented tomorrow, when the company’s EBIT, its operating income for capital items and taxes, is, according to provisional external results, negative about 100 to 110 million U.S. dollars or about 15 billion Icelandic kroner.
Icelandair sent the Norwegian Stock Exchange preliminary calculations last Wednesday, where it said that the company’s revenues amounted to around $60 million in the quarter or to about ISK 8.3 billion.
The cash equivalent was about 154 million U.S. dollars at the end of the quarter, about 21 billion ISK.
Icelandair also plans to offer the company’s share capital in August.
Icelandair is planning to conclude a deal with fifteen creditors, the government and the Boeing aircraft manufacturer before the end of the month before it will be part-financed.
A new variant rather than a new type of virus
“New virus just means that it has been a person who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been squandering here domestically,” says M<0xC3><0xA1>r Kristj<0xC3><0xA1>nsson, chief physician at Landspitalan’s infectious disease department, about the news that “a new type of virus” has been detected here in Iceland.
Three domestic animals were spotted yesterday and two at the border.
One who was diagnosed had taken part in a sports club’s social work at the Rey Cup football tournament, but the origin of the infection remains undiscovered and the infection is contagious.
Also, infection was detected in a person who arrived in the country on 15 July and there were two who were in contact with him beginning to show signs of COVID-19.
A new type of virus that has not been detected before was identified in Icelandic genetic analysis.
The infection is complete in connection with this infection.
M<0xC3><0xA1>r notes that it is not a new virus but is the same virus that has spread around the world, i.e. the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
It is better to talk about a new variant of that virus than about a new type of virus.
Asked what it meant and whether it could say anything about the other waves of epidemics being started, M<0xC3><0xA1>r says that as if there is a single case to be discussed and it could go so there will be nothing more from it.
“However, if domestic cases are to arise that are not related from abroad and have the same genotype as this particular variant, then the conclusion [of the second wave] could be drawn, but it is premature to so support,” explains M<0xC3><0xA1>r.
The Happiness of the Hot Pot
Is the secret to the happiness of Icelanders hidden in the hot pots?
BBC programmers are leading the way in a fun video that sheds light on the swimming pool and hot tub culture of the country.
The Icelandic bath culture is unique worldwide and it is claimed that nowhere in the world are as many baths per capita.
The natural geothermal energy is the basis of it, but also the tradition of separation that prevails here.
Children's health education was legal in 1940, but older citizens are no less indebted to using hot water for health benefits.
Health is described as a permanent part of the country’s overall well-being.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of height and position.
Along with the mobile phones, people converse on personal notes about the home and the space or enjoyment of the likeable power of the water: the thoughts and charges of the batteries of the soul and body.
On the road to a hundred days in elections
Hundreds of days remain until the United States elects a president for four years.
Donald Trump is seeking re-election, but he is still in the process of re-election.
Joe Biden, the Democratic Party’s prospective candidate, has a strong national advantage over Trump, according to the polls.
According to a recent AP survey, the U.S. population believes that the nation is on the wrong track.
Trump’s reaction to the global catastrophe of the new coronavirus is also very unpopular, and more Americans believe that the president has been holding a bad balance in the economy.
In fact, only two out of every 10 Americans say the United States is on the right track.
Thirty-two percent say they support Trump’s response to the epidemic and 48 percent say he has maintained good economic relations.
In March it was 56 percent and in January it was 67 percent.
According to the average FiveThirtyEight, Biden is 49.9 percent nationally, while Trump is 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to draw attention from his performance towards the epidemic of Biden, push under so-called cultural divides, and announce policies aimed at law and order.
Biden, however, is keen to keep his attention on Trump and believes there is a high chance of winning if the election actually revolves around how Trump has been working in the last four years.
Unpopular Trump also appears to be going down on Republican Party MPs, fearing Democrats could even reach a majority in the U.S. Senate, which so far has been very slow.
Politico said at the time that the categories and candidates remain comparable, and it is now that the Republican Party would have its greatest dismay for decades.
Environment has proved particularly bad in the 2016 parliamentary elections, and now it looks like this trend will continue.
Trump has in recent days tried to frighten the population of the suburbs to follow, including by saying that if Biden becomes president, he will destroy the outskirts of the United States and push under a racial divide.
Among other things, Trump has repealed a regulation from the time of Barack Obama in the White House that was designed to increase diversity in the suburbs.
He then urged the “homewife” of the U.S. to read an article about former New York State Secretary, stating that Biden would destroy the U.S. territory and take Trump under it.
“Biden will ruin your neighborhood and American dreams.
I will keep it, and even make it even better," the president said.
The U.S. population is an ever-increasing group of voters.
According to NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.
Since the re-election of George W. Bush in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of this group’s votes has become president.
Except in 2012 when Mitt Romney won the majority of the vote from this group but lost to Barack Obama.
The polls have shown that, despite Trump securing the exact majority in the 2016 polls, his follow-up there has been a significant contraction.
While there are differences between the polls, Biden has measured around 15 percent of Trump’s lead in the recent outreach.

Will the Olympian be the light at the end of the course?
After the final decision had been made to postpone the Olympic Games, events that only world wars have progressed to date, the President of the International Olympic Committee said that the Olympic Age would be famous “the light at the end of the corridors,” referring to the global pandemic of the Coronavirus that would be the world’s leading cause of victory.
Employees have years to prepare and the authorities in Japan are improving their costs due to the delay.
Everyone is going to end up in a lot of trouble.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the venue of the Olympic Games this year, the Japanese representatives’ glories were authentic.
They were crying and laughing for a second time, as Tokyo had applied to hold the 2016 games but beat it a second time in lower hold for Rio in Brazil.
This time, Tokyo and Japan were to bathe in the attention of the world.
The games were scheduled to run from 24 July to 9 August, but have been postponed for years and will start on 23 July 2021 and end on 8 August.
If they fail to keep the games, if the crown virus still becomes too much of a threat, the games will be stopped.
No one wants to think that way to the end.
The Olympics are not an ordinary sports competition.
Nothing is saved, the show should always be magnificent and strive to top the last play.
The choice of a city for the Olympics is based on the opinion of the selection committee on the presentations of the cities.
The more magnificent the presentation is —the more likely you are to get the hump.
Tokyo spent $150 million trying to hold the 2016 Olympics, or nearly $20 billion.
The second time, when the games were applied for in 2020, 75 million dollars, about ten billion kroner, were put into the presentation.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo had the games this year, the Japanese authorities had already paid 30 billion kroner to the project.
But that amount is just a drop in the ocean, given how much it costs to build Olympic Villages, stadiums, and generally to strengthen the country’s infrastructure to tackle such tournaments, prepare it and keep the games themselves.
Japan’s organizers have said that the Tokyo Olympics, which should have been running these days but have been postponed for a year due to the coronavirus, would have cost 12.6 billion dollars.
However, a report by the Japan State Auditor General that came out at the end of last year found that the cost was almost double that number.
It may not be possible to fully estimate the cost of delaying the games, but it has been estimated that it can cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the initial cost.
The total cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore run between 15 and 30 billion dollars.
There are so many numbers that all of the Icelandic state’s tax revenues only accounted for about half of the Olympic Games, given the lowest possible cost.
The Olympics are an event of the magnitude that they have preferred to become the topics of discussion of economists, who try to review the numbers and examine the benefits and benefits of the games.
The most important thing seems to be that many people have come to the conclusion that the impact of the Olympics is less than so positive for the economy of the cities that hold them.
Short-term effects are some, for example, increasing jobs very much for a short period of time, but in the longer term, cities tend to sit up with debt-intensive and high-risk operating costs of low-used structures.
Rio in Brazil is facing significant debts due to the 2016 games and has been in trouble with the maintenance of all the major sports structures built for the games.
According to the 2012 London Games, only 10 percent of those who received jobs related to the Olympic Games in the city were unemployed.
This means that it was not a new job, except in a small way.
In general, cities have not been particularly successful in keeping the Olympic Games financially because of the slick costs associated with the structures built for the games.
However, the benefits are likely to include increased travel by tourists who wish to visit the Olympic cities following the games, although there is a lot of uncertainty about the 2021 games.
It is also unclear whether it will be possible to accommodate all the number of viewers who usually download the games.
The main thing, however, is the honor that the cities are supposed to be chosen, but it is difficult to estimate money.
Therefore, despite the enormous cost, it can also be said that the joy that the games bring is not the nature of being able to put on it a price tag.
But even if the show is very big and there is no savings, it’s not just about money.
It is the sports heroes who are in the foreground.
For some players, it’s a good idea to postpone the game.
Australia's five-time female and gold medalist in his article on the Olympic Games side, Chloe Esposito, for example, is a cashier and would have been far from a good old man this summer, but has hopes of being in a competitive form for the 2021 Games.
She is therefore among those athletes who are just more satisfied with the delay, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who intended to quit after the games this year, they would have been held at the right time, meaning the suspension of the games in some cases means that they quit the competition before the games take place.
Trust your body simply does not have to go through years in addition to rigorous exercises.
Few athletes were equally successful in the hearts of the spectators at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio and the five-star star Simone Biles.
She came home with four golds around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has recently been interviewed in his home country of the United States to discuss the Olympics.
She plans to play in 2021, but she’s not sure she’ll still be at the top of the games next year, as she’ll be 24 years old.
Although it is generally not considered to be of high age, it is in a higher order for a femininity woman in the front row.
"This is a sensitive issue," Biles says, but smiles out in another interview published on the Olympic Committee's Instagram page asked if she is going to reach the 2021 Games as long as she did in Rio 2016.
“I honestly don’t know if I’ll still be on top after a whole year of additional exercises,” Biles says.
She has previously mentioned that her body does not tolerate the stress that accompanies fitness training much longer.
However, she is still competing for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles admits that it was an uncomfortable feeling to suddenly have to stop exercising when the world disaster was at its highest and the gym was closed.
There were no exceptions for Biles rather than others while all sports teams were closed for seven weeks.
All of her Olympic gold could not buy any access over the others, she had to find a variety of ways to stay in shape like others.
The basics are certainly better than most people.
“We have a plan now.
It was hard to start exercising again after the gym opened.
We started slowly, but we’re back in full swing, and I’m going to increase my workouts steadily as the year goes by.
Of course, we don’t know exactly what these games will be or whether they will be held, but we still practice, given that they will be, can’t do anything else.
I’ve been putting too much effort into leaving the sport now,” Biles says.
With it, as with other blind doubts or perhaps further awareness that this position may arise that the games will not be held at all in 2021 either.
But predicting it is hopeless.
No one can know what will happen in July 2021 and nothing else to do but prepare for the Olympics because they will be held next year.
Maybe the Olympics will be the light at the end of the Covid gangs.
Delayed wedding due to an epidemic
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the Coronavirus.
She was married to former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams this summer.
“I think there’s other important things to think about right now,” the actress said in a conversation with People.
“We want to get married at some point and have a dream wedding and have all the people we love.
But we decided to hit it on time and focus on what’s important right now and it’s helping to share information about the importance of wearing masks and staying home.
I’m looking more at the world than at weddings these days.
There is a lot going on and we should focus our attention on what is happening in the world."
