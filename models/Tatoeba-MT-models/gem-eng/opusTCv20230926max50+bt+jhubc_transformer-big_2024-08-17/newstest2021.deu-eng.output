Biker reacts lightning fast and prevents worse
On Friday evening, a traffic accident occurred on the highway between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured due to his rapid response.
Driver overlooks biker
A 44-year-old driver wanted to take her VW from Merklingen towards Machtolsheim at around 9.30 a.m. and turn left onto Landesstra<0xC3><0x9F>e 1230.
In doing so, she overlooked the 24-year-old motorcyclist coming from the direction of Nellingen.
In the collision, hand and foot brake levers fly away
The biker was still trying to avoid the car, but still stripped it at the rear of the vehicle area.
As a result of the stripping process, the hand and foot brake levers were torn off at the Suzuki and the driver was no longer able to brake.
At the moment he steered his motorcycle into the green-stiffs next to the roadway and let it roll out there without falling.
Biker suffers leg injury
However, due to the collision with the car, the biker suffered an injury to the leg and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvest helpers infected
After a corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in Mamming, Lower Bavaria, almost 500 people are quarantined and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
A security service monitors the outage bid.
A total of 174 harvest helpers were tested positively on the corona pathogen Sars-CoV-2 during the series investigation, as the Landratsamt Dingolfing-Landau reported on Saturday evening.
"In order to avoid further spread, we unfortunately have to take this step to protect the population," said Landrat Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already been infected in the company - this was the reason for the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm, which grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and red beetroot - but the cucumbers only for inlay jars.
Mamming is a rural community with over 3300 inhabitants near Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to keep calm: "According to our information, it is a closed circle of people".
On the farm, infected were separated from uninfected employees, the site is now surrounded by a barrier fence.
Greens and SPD gave the state government co-responsibility.
The two opposition factions accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting the control of the accommodations of seasonal workers.
"This can be bitterly resented if such local infection events take place and regional lockdowns have to be arranged," said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary director of the Greens.
This is very similar to the SPD: "We have already called for a special control program for farms with harvest helpers after the coronavirus outbreak in the Wiesenhof slaughterhouse in mid-May," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"The hygiene conditions at the workplace and the living conditions must be strictly controlled from our point of view.
That obviously didn’t happen.”
The outbreak came "with an announcement".
Aidenbachstra<0xC3><0x9F>e Underground Station: Dangerous dispute: 19-year-old falls into the track bed after Schubser
In a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstra<0xC3><0x9F>e metro station, a 19-year-old fell through a pusher and slipped into the track bed.
Obersendling - On Friday, at the Aidenbachstra<0xC3><0x9F>e metro station around 4.15 p.m., there was a dispute between two youth groups.
A passerby alerted the police, who touched with several stripes.
According to the first investigation, a Munich (17) pushed a 19-year-old to the ground.
The young man slipped over the platform edge and fell into the track bed.
People from the group of the 17-year-old helped the crashed out of the track.
There was no danger due to an incoming train.
As the police say, there were disputes between the two people.
The 17-year-old fled the scene, but his personal data could be determined afterwards.
In the presence of his father, he went to the police inspection 29.
Against the 17-year-old is determined for bodily injury.
Report: Seehofer urges longer storage of data
Storage data storage is currently suspended.
According to a media report, Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer, however, calls for an extension of the storage period.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
According to a media report, Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer (CSU) calls for an extended storage of data - instead of the planned ten weeks half a year.
Seehofer asked Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) in a letter for a quick change of law.
Seehofer therefore wants to strengthen the measures against child abuse.
He believes it makes sense to "make urgently necessary adjustments to the law already now," the newspaper quoted the letter.
Currently, the storage of data is suspended.
A decision of the Court of Justice is expected.
Seehofer, however, wants the changes to be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, the report says.
A Justice Department spokesman told the newspaper that it would only be sensible to check whether legal adjustments would be necessary if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer and the interior ministers of the countries had already expressed their support for data storage in June.
NBA: Strip club anger for Clippers star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), basketball pro of the Los Angeles Clippers, is said to have left the tournament quarter at Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to U.S. media reports, however, he visited the "Magic City" strip club in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is said to have admitted to the visit according to ESPN data, is back in isolation, is being tested daily for Covid-19.
His reason for visiting: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, "Sweet Lou", as he is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for these exact wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, note R.) have the best wings in the city."
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Twitter on Sunday that NBA Williams has ordered a 10-day quarantine.
Thus, the Clippers star misses the first two official games after the test game phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to play the Corona season.
Currently, the top 22 teams with training games are preparing for the season finale starting at night on Friday.
Söder expresses herself after mass infection to the corona location
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced on Sunday a tender for large farms.
The press conference will be live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in Dingolfing-Landau district has alarmed authorities and politics.
At the large vegetable farm, almost 500 harvest helpers from several countries are currently working, over a third have been infected with the corona pathogen.
The courtyard is now under quarantine and is locked with a building fence.
No one is allowed to leave the premises, food is delivered.
More than 3,300 residents of the municipality now offer free corona testing.
Since the harvest helpers had little contact with the local population, the Landratsamt has so far assumed that the infections have not spread beyond the farm.
"Conscience Bite": Confession of the alleged arsonist of Nantes
“My client showed himself cooperative,” Quentin Chabert, a lawyer, told the newspaper.
The defender added, "He greatly regrets the actions, the confession was a liberation for him."
His mandate was “punished by the bite of conscience and very much taken away from the extent of the destruction.”
In the event of a conviction, the man faces a 10-year prison sentence and a fine of 150,000 euros, according to the prosecutor’s office.
The Gothic Saint Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes had been badly damaged by a fire on Saturday last week.
The fire broke out in three far-away places in the church.
Laboratory investigations hardened the suspicion of arson.
The suspect who had been detained had already been arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after a day.
The man works as a volunteer for the Diocese of Nantes and was responsible for the closure of the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no trace of a violent intrusion into the church, he quickly entered the field of view of the investigators.
Discuss the abolition of the 50+1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended that the 50+1 rule be abolished.
“German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates completed facts,” Grindel said.
He stressed: "For the clubs that are most likely to become dangerous Bayern and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, there is no way around the debate whether it is not necessary to facilitate the inclusion of investors by associations that want to break into this phalanx."
However, he has doubts as to whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority participations that are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
“It remains a legal risk to move investment fences around the business location of the Bundesliga in a European single market,” Grindel said.
The former DFB boss sees the danger that "the attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at the European level, but do not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even an equal distribution of TV money will not have a decisive effect.
FC Bayern makes a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
So the differences are already immense among the first three clubs alone.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million," the 58-year-old said.
Looking at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
“Unfortunately, there have been people who noticed this mistake and pushed it through to the press instead of addressing me,” Grindel said of accepting an expensive watch that led to his resignation in April 2019.
“It’s been very busy for me humanly.”
He had received the gift of around 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.
“I committed a compliance violation, and it was right to draw the consequences from it,” Grindel said.
"With the ominous watch gift, I have been completely transparent and ruthlessly dealt with.
A lot of people in the DFB knew about it.”
He never “made a hell out of the gift,” the 58-year-old assured.
"That may be called naive, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption".
"Black Lives Matter": Injured and a Dead
The protests against police violence in the United States have re-emerged through Donald Trump’s use of federal police officers in several cities.
On Saturday, clashes between protesters and police officers took place in various cities.
Three people were injured in Louisville and 16 people were arrested in Seattle.
In Austin, a person was killed by gunfire while a demonstration train just crossed a junction.
Previously, there had been clashes in Portland during protests against racism and police violence.
The security forces, including federal police officers, used tear gas on Saturday night and violently drove demonstrators apart.
Hundreds of partially armed protesters marched through Louisville, Kentucky, on Saturday, demanding that those responsible for Breonna Taylor’s death be held accountable.
The 26-year-old student was shot in a drug raid in her Louisville apartment in March.
The aim of the raid was someone else who did not live there, and no drugs were found.
On Saturday, when a member of a group calling himself the armed alliance of black Americans fired a shot, three people were injured.
According to NBC, they were taken to the hospital.
None of them were in danger of death.
The police set up barricades because area protesters had also formed a white militia.
In the end, there was no meeting between the two groups.
In Austin, Texas, a person was shot and killed as part of a Black Lives Matter demonstration.
According to the police, a suspect was taken into custody.
Further details on the circumstances of the act have not been made so far.
Mayor Steve Adler told the New York Times that, like many in the city, he was "inconsolable and unconstitutional" about what had happened.
Protesters also clashed with police in Seattle on Saturday.
They set fire to construction cars in front of a youth prison, and the police used blend grenades and pepper spray.
According to the Seattle Times, 16 people were arrested for resistance to police officers or bodily injury.
In Oakland, California, a courthouse was set on fire.
A small group of demonstrators have hit windows, shot down fireworks and blinded police officers with lasers, Oakland police said late Saturday evening (local time).
The fire could be quickly extinguished.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver, Colorado, a car drove through a crowd demonstrating on a highway.
According to police, one of the protesters fired a gun and at least one person was taken to the hospital injured.
In addition, windows were also smashed in a court of law and a fire was laid, as the police said.
Investigations have been initiated.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy Corona
Although the big sauce in the spa town was missing, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: The Rakoczy weekend without Rakoczy party.
But: Even though the big party mile in the city centre was missing, which burns crowds and program highlights such as halls, Rakoczy ball or fortifications, many of the Corona-compliant alternative program came at their expense.
“I think we have managed to spread Rakoczy flair,” says curator Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have accepted it well.
In principle, one returns to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, as the historical ones alone were the focus of the festival.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konh<0xC3><0xA4>user has been visiting Bad Kissingen with her husband for more than 25 years.
This time in the Corona year.
The couple has made it comfortable at Luitpold casino, watching the historicals while strolling and listening to Cuban live music at the casino restaurant.
"I think it's very pleasant," says Konh<0xC3><0xA4>user.
She does not miss the crowds that are otherwise part of Rakoczy.
However, she lacks the usual programme highlights, especially Saale burns on Friday evening as well as the historic fortification and the final fireworks on Sunday evening.
"That's a shame.
The weather would have been great this year,” she says.
Rakoczy Reitturnier to take place again
For the actors of the historical spa guests, the alternative program meant some more work.
For example, for Christina Gold, who participates in a normal year on the parade and can be seen there on the carriage of the Kurgartencafé.
This year she was walking in costume in the city on Saturdays and Sundays.
"It's already exhausting, otherwise we'll have it easier," she says.
The riding club had less to do, even if individual riders were traveling in the park.
"We very much hope that the equestrian quadrille will be allowed to take place again next year," says Chairman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years of break in 2021, another Rakoczy re-tournament will take place.
28 Corona cases with Spanish second-ligist Fuenlabrada
Spain’s football second-tier CF Fuenlabrada is slipping deeper and deeper into the crisis due to a coronavirus outbreak.
Since the newcomer from near Madrid had flown to a game in the city of A Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a despite the first Corona cases on July 20, a deep blow follows the next.
By Sunday, 28 players or team members had been tested positive, one came to the hospital, the club said.
Fuenlabrada from the city of the same name south-west of Madrid still had the chance to reach the ascent playoffs.
Now even the descent into the B-group of the Second League is threatening.
The game against Deportivo La Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a last Monday was canceled at the last minute, the prosecutor's office determined because of a possible crime against public health, the supreme sports authority CSD is considering the forced descent of the club.
Players as well as other team members sit in a hotel in quarantine.
“Until the sixth day of quarantine, they didn’t get a fresh towel or gel,” the sports newspaper “AS” wrote.
The photos show players hanging underwear and club clothes in their rooms in the hotel for drying after they had to wash them themselves.
Also, the bed linen was not changed for five days.
Another problem is food.
Neither good nor sufficient, wrote "AS".
However, the club management said they were satisfied with the hotel.
The accusation of intentionally endangering public health was rejected by the club’s lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas.
It did not violate the corona rules set up by the Football Association, stressed the son of the president of the Spanish Primera Division, Javier Tebas, as reported by the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper "Marca".
Before the departure, there were four infected by July 19, but all of them were isolated and did not travel.
Just before the flight on Monday to A Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, all players and team members were tested again.
When the team was already in A Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, then "five or six" other team members of the corona test had been positive.
The game was canceled 60 minutes before the start, Tebas Llanas said.
Police have to catch horses that have been pulled out of steam
Two animals were on the road.
The police took her back to her owner.
On Sunday morning just before 6 a.m., a road participant shared two free-running horses on the feeder between the junction Donnersdorf/Steinsfeld and the motorway junction Theres.
At the arrival of the officials, the horses were already back between the feeder and the village of Dampfach.
After the confidence of the horses could be gained by the officials shortly before steam roof, they each had a rope carried in the striped car wrapped around them.
Tony Martin: Career continuation imaginable
Time travel specialist Tony Martin thinks about a continuation of his career.
Frankfurt/Main - Seven-time World Champion Tony Martin can imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I'm just sticking with the team to determine how and in what form it could go on," said the 35-year-old of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung.
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career after this year before the Corona break.
During the negotiations with his team, it is also about the number of race days, he said.
Or about other problems that would plague him as a family father, Martin said.
He used to get up after a crash, and the first thought was, "Quick back on the bike.
Today, as the father of a little daughter, I think: what if?
The cyclist admitted that there are certainly aspects with which he is increasingly difficult to deal with.
"But it was good for me to notice from the Corona era what I have on cycling and how much fun he's doing to me".
The time trial specialist will return to the competition at the Tour de l'Ain (5 to 9 August).
Bayern: At least four dead on Bayern’s streets at weekends
The beautiful weather attracts bikers on the streets in many places.
For at least three people, the tour ends fatally with the motorcycle.
An 18-year-old pedestrian also dies.
Schönthal - In the event of accidents on Bavaria’s streets, several, mostly young people have died on the weekend.
An 18-year-old motorcyclist was caught on Saturday at Schönthal (Cham County) by a car that came on the opposite track.
Why the car was heading in the opposite direction was not clear at first.
In Upper Bavaria on Saturday, a 22-year-old on his machine collided with a horse-drawn carriage.
He was traveling downhill, according to police at Beilngries.
In a left-hand corner, he bumped against the carriage.
His injuries were so severe that he died at the scene of the accident.
Of the twelve occupants of the carriage, a man was severely injured and a man slightly injured, police said.
In another fatal accident, an 18-year-old died in Bad Kötzting, Upper Palatinate.
He had been on a road that night for Sunday and was overrolled by a 42-year-old driver.
According to the police, the 18-year-old wanted to sleep.
The driver could no longer brake in time.
At Schönberg (Freyung-Grafenau County) on Saturday, a 57-year-old biker bumped into a right-hand corner despite full braking frontal against a car.
He died at the scene of the accident.
The 57-year-old driver suffered a shock and the other three people in the car remained unharmed.
The safety of motorcyclists was discussed on Saturday by Bavarian Transport Minister Kerstin Schreyer (CSU).
In a letter to the organiser of the biker protests against driving bans announced for August, Gabor Kovacs, the minister referred to extensive investments such as underrun protection on guide boards and the deterrence of dangerous curves.
“For the safety of motorcyclists, we have achieved a lot in recent years,” the letter said.
"The number of killed motorized two-wheelers decreased by around 28 percent compared to 2011".
Kovac tests against Frankfurt with Monaco
Frankfurt/Main (dpa) - For football coach Niko Kovac there will soon be a reunion with Eintracht Frankfurt with his new club AS Monaco.
The eight-time French champion will be visiting the Hessen, the former Croatian club, on August 1st (18.00 a.m.).
For the Bundesliga, it is the first and only hard test before the return match in the Europa League against FC Basel (6 August).
Because of the coronavirus pandemic, the encounter is held without spectators.
"We are particularly looking forward to this game.
It’s always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends,” Kovac said.
This is an interesting test, the 48-year-old said.
Prior to his move to FC Bayern Munich, Kovac had trained the Hessen from 2016 to 2018 and led to the victory in the DFB-Pokal.
“A top-class opponent like Monaco is a good test for us in terms of the game against Basel.
Like all Frankfurters, I look forward to seeing you again with Niko Kovac,” said Eintracht coach Adi Hütter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had taken on the succession of the Croatian during the unification.
In March, the Frankfurters had lost the eighth-final draw against Basel at their own stadium with 0:3.
Nearly 50 new infections: Landkreis Hof just past the lockdown
In the district of Hof, the number of known new coronavirus infections has increased further over the weekend: from 39 on Friday and 43 on Saturday (one person is cured and no longer falls into these statistics) to 47 on Sunday.
In addition, there is a case in the town of Hof.
Thus, the Hof space approaches the critical brand of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants in one week.
700 dead due to monsoon rains in Southeast Asia
More than 9 million people are affected by the severe flooding in Southeast Asia, especially in Bangladesh, India and Nepal.
Because of the heavy monsoon rain, a total of 700 people were killed.
In Bangladesh, the Red Crescent is trying to reach the isolated people in boats.
Whole villages are under water.
Farmers have lost their crops.
Panzer horns in National Park die from landslides
In the Kaziranga National Park, several of the 120 panzer horns died from landslides.
They are protected and considered endangered by extinction.
This year, the floods are particularly bad, which is what brings knowledge creators back to climate change.
According to the United Nations, Bangladesh is one of the countries most affected by global warming.
New apartments are empty
In the town of Cox's Bazar in the south of Bangladesh, the state has built apartments for 650 displaced by the floods.
So far, only a few have moved in.
It's hard to get people to Cox's Bazar.
The excitement is also in Grenezn.
Anyone who used to have a house was still so small and like a cottage often does not want to spend his life in a large apartment block.
Many apartments are empty, but should soon be occupied by those who have lost their homes due to the floods.

Argentina Rejects Creditors’ Counter-Offer
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Buenos Aires said on Saturday.
“This would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair,” he said in a statement.
“While 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase our creditors’ short-term profits.”
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer sustainable under the current conditions.
That’s why Argentina asks its private creditors to waive some of their claims of around $66 billion (around $59 billion).
If there is no agreement, the country will once again threaten the state felony.
It would be the ninth payment default in Argentine history.
Recently, lenders had demanded higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
The Argentine government, however, holds on to its latest offer and is not ready for any further concessions.
Argentina is in a serious financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate last was more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect a decline in economic power by around ten percent.
By the end of May, Argentina had not paid interest claims amounting to $503 million and had thus slipped into a limited payment default.
Arrived professionally - not yet in private
"It's going great" - this conclusion draws Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days at the Notariat in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: in mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will succeed Lutz Feller in the Eggenfelder Notariatsstelle.
Already six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the lawyer took up the job, the normal daily business is long on full tours.
"Privately, I still have to arrive," she explains in conversation with the Rottal indicator and laughs.
Of course, the short lead time was not enough to move the food point from Regensburg completely to Eggenfelden, reports the native Dingolfinger.
She and her husband, who is a judge at the district court in Regensburg, are currently looking for a suitable apartment or a house in the city.
At least her husband could still apply for parental leave in the short term to ensure the care of the two daughters (31<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 and 11<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 years old).
In order not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, she sometimes also has an overnight stay with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Growing up in the neighbouring county, the town of Eggenfelden has been a term for a long time.
During visits to the site with her family in recent months, she again stated: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town".
She was all the more pleased that she had made the race in the selection process for the free position.
In Dr. Stefanie Kramer’s professional career, her home country of Lower Bavaria also plays a central role: After studying law in Passau, she completed her period of residency and the 2nd state examination in Regensburg.
After several positions as Notarassessorin, among others in Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen im Unterallg<0xC3><0xA4>u and Regensburg - during this time she also "next door" trained her doctorate in labour law - she took her first position as notary in Rotthalmünster in Passau County in 2012.
In 2016 she went into parental leave, and the move to Regensburg followed.
Since then, she has taken over representation services in various notarial offices.
When the position was advertised in Eggenfelden for the approaching retirement of Lutz Feller, she had seen the right time for full professional re-entry, the 39-year-old explains.
The team of their predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation at the Notarial Office in the future, has completely taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and has a praise for the team of the law firm ready: "It's going great!"
The fact that she can rely on recorded processes makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of the private food point.
In terms of kindergarten and crib places, she has already made contact with a local institution.
And if everything works out as desired, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging routes of the Rottal.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled to 20 percent at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
“Due to the distance regulation that is mandatory, we plan to meet the current state of affairs with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators,” Borussia Dortmund’s Managing Director Carsten Cramer told the Daily Mirror.
Normally, the arena in the district city holds a little more than 81,000 spectators in Bundesliga matches.
In last season’s ghost games caused by the Corona pandemic, the BVB had lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitization and internationalization at the BVB, hopes that in addition to the normal spectator seats, some of the approximately 4000 seats in the hospitality area can be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the office when these revenues completely break away".
Given the ongoing coronavirus crisis, everyone is currently "well advised to take a stable side-length first."
“If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are in short work alone in Germany, then the need for entertainment is limited,” Cramer explained.
The head of marketing at Dortmund praised the BVB professionals for their part-time salary waiver, which is intended to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, players know that their salary waiver has a different effect than if we put 100 people working in merchandising on short-term work".
Tiny miracles: early start to life with a few hundred grams
Hardly heavier than a packerl butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The boy is one of about 400 early children who are cared for annually at the Graz Children's Hospital.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few—like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael—are extreme lightweights with not even a kilogram of birth weight.
They are so small and so early that neither lungs, nor intestines, nor muscles are fully formed.
Your skin is sometimes so tender that it could damage the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and specially made mini-windows for them.
But not so small that they would not be with voice - "and how", Berndt Urlesberger smiles.
"Even if, of course, they don't scream quite as loudly as big babies".
When the whiteboard becomes the stage
Despite Corona Theater in the classroom: The whiteboard as a stage experienced the 9th classes of the St. James High School in Abtsgmünd just before the start of the holiday season.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the Theater of the City of Aalen presented the students with the production "Das Heimatkleid" - via video.
Afterwards, the students were able to exchange information about the play and the performance with the actress and director Winfried Tobias via Skype.
The idea for the performance format was born from the current Corona situation.
Teacher Teresa Nar was delighted about the enrichment of teaching.
Even though all the participants at the end agreed that the direct meeting in the theatre and stage room would offer additional stimuli, the theatre also sees the potential for contact in the schools.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the game," said director Winfried Tobias.
First round drawn: TSV 1860 would meet at Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB-Pokal
If the TSV 1860 qualify for the DFB-Pokal, the Lions will meet at Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This was the draw on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty possible opponents in the first round of the DFB-Pokal are determined.
The Lions would meet at Eintracht Frankfurt in a successful qualification.
This resulted in the draw on Sunday evening in the ARD sports show.
Because due to the Corona pandemic the participant field is not yet complete, placeholders were used in the draw.
Due to the voluntary abandonment of semi-final opponent FC Memmingen, the TSV 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto Cup (4th or 5th September).
There the lions meet either the Würzburger Kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
If second-league runner-up Würzburg reached the final, Sixty would already qualify for the first round in the DFB-Pokal.
Otherwise, the Giesinger would have to prevail in the final match against Regionalligist Aschaffenburg.
The first round of the DFB Cup will be held between 11 and 14 September and thus one week before the third league start.
"Vom Winde bewitched": film legend Olivia de Havilland is dead
Film legend and Oscar winner Olivia de Havilland has died.
She died on Sunday in Paris with 104 years of natural death, her spokesperson for the German Press Agency confirmed.
De Havilland was known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in the South-State epic "Vom Winde bewecht" (1939).
Born in Tokyo as a child of British parents, Olivia de Havilland moved to California as a toddler.
Austrian theatre man Max Reinhardt discovered the 19-year-old in the role of the Hermia of Shakespeare's "Summer Night's Dream".
Warner Brothers immediately signed them for seven years and brought them out alongside Eroll Flynn.
She made eight films with the heartbreaker.
In 1946, she won her first Oscar in the lead role of "To Each His Own".
The film ran in Germany under the title "Mutterherz".
Three years later, the award came as the best actress in William Wyler's "The Heiress" (The Erbin).
She was also widely recognized as a neurotic eccentric in "The Dark Mirror" and "The Snake Pit".
Daphne du Maurier suggested her in 1952 for the lead role in the filming of her novel "My cousin Rachel".
The piece became a worldwide success.
With her longtime friend Bette Davis, she starred in "Wiegenlied für ein Leichte".
From marriage to the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946 to 1953), the son Benjamin emerged.
In Paris, de Havilland married the journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had his daughter Gis<0xC3><0xA8>le with him.
This marriage also broke down.
Rumors of an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath have never been confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beach volleyball: Thole/Wickler miss finale at comeback
World Cup runners-up Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the final at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, they submitted in the semi-finals to their national team colleagues Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
Last year, Thole/Wickler played at the World Tour Final in Rome.
In the final match on the Rhine, their winger Ehlers/Flügen against the surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde scored a defeat with 0:2 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German championships were played in Timmendorfer Strand at the beginning of September: the tickets secured Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers.
Kalbitz ejection from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "fig leaf"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is from the view of the FDP only a "fig leaf" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the far-right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of radicals in the AfD,” said the FDP internal politician Benjamin Strasser of the news agency dpa in Berlin.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD confirmed on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of negotiations the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Board of Governors had decided in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD Group in the Brandenburg Landtag.
“If the AfD were really about removing right-wing extremists from their party consistently, officials like Björn Höcke and his supporters would have long been excluded,” Strasser said.
"There is no political will in the AfD, however, because right-wing extremism is now part of the party".
Similarly, CSU Secretary General Markus Blume said: "That Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded, says nothing and changes nothing," he told the "World on Sunday".
"It rather speaks volumes of how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist in the middle of the AfD still has".
Blume expects the AfD to land below 5% in elections in the future.
"The days of the AfD in parliaments are numbered".
Kalbitz was one of the leaders of the officially dissolved "wing" around Thuringia's AfD country and faction chairman Björn Höcke; the constitutional protection classifies the ostriches as "secure right-wing extremist aspirations".
In May, the AfD Federal Board had thrown Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz did not specify a previous membership in the now-prohibited extreme right-wing "Heimatttreuen Deutsche Jugend" (HDJ) and among the Republicans.
Kalbitz denies membership in HDJ.
The chairman of the left-wing faction in the Brandenburg Landtag, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court did not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf only ate chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, whether with or without Kalbitz".
This decision does not weaken the Federal Party or the right wing.
"The maneuver of the Meuthen troop is transparent.
We want to avoid further observation by constitutional protection and try to get through under the radar," Walter said.
"The AfD will not let go of the spirits she called.
There is still nothing to change,” commented Brandenburg SPD Secretary-General Erik Stohn on the decision in the case of Kalbitz.
"Here the AfD Country Association and the faction held to this day to their right-wing leader".
The legal dispute over the membership of Kalbitz in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he will now take action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court under civil law.
North Sea wind farms supply 21 percent more electricity
In the first six months of the year, the wind power plants on the German North Sea fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid.
That’s a good 21 percent more than in the same period last year, network operator Tennet said in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea current to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity grid.
Wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which do not belong to the Tennet network area, have fed in an additional 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
In total, the wind power from the North and Baltic Seas thus comes to 13.73 TWh, compared to a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
Wind harvesting at sea accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind power in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms increase production capacity
In addition to the wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from higher generation capacities, because new wind farms have been connected to the grid in the last 12 months.
If the 1,270 wind power plants in the North Sea were to run at full power at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
By 2030, it is expected to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore grid connections," said Tennet CEO Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, even at sea, wind farms cannot exploit their capacity, but reach about 40 percent.
The record day so far this year is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply nearly seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition of the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
This was almost a small anniversary celebration for the 130th anniversary.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works by Leipzig artist Christian Bold blew up the usual framework after the Corona break.
Much more art lovers than usual pursued the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Kunstverein, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent delivered the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern Kornhausplatz.
To the north of the gallery, the association "Sandtogether" was engaged.
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled due to Corona
The Windberg Festival will not take place this year.
The city of Freital cancelled the three-day festival planned in September.
In other years, more than 30,000 people had visited this city festival.
"We really didn't make this decision easy and - knowing how difficult it is economically for the parties involved - we were hoping for the last minute," said Uwe Rumberg, mayor of the city.
"But ultimately we are here as organizers responsible for the health of many thousands of people".
If tens of thousands had flown onto the fixed site and into the fixed tent, minimum distances, hygiene regulations as well as contact tracking could not have been complied with in accordance with the current Corona Protection Regulation.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that not much would have been left of a folk festival.
In addition, the organisational and monitoring costs would increase disproportionately by a number of times.
Rumberg consoled next year.
The city of Freital then celebrates its 100th anniversary with the Winterbergfest from 7 to 9 May 2021 as well as the day of Saxony from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dressage Olympic champion Werth in Achleiten not to beat
Achleiten - The six-time Olympic winner Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressage tournament in Achleiten, Austria.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg came to four victories on the weekend at four starts.
After winning a Grand Prix at the start with gold and Quantaz, she was also unable to beat on Sunday in the Grand Prix Special and in a short time.
At the 15-year-old mare Weihegold, Werth made a clear stand against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen on Sunday in the special.
Also in the short time the Germans were clearly on Quantaz on Saturday in front of their 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer.
Werth's winning horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world is set to establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz, it was the first cure ever.
At the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago, Werth had won all four important competitions.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for August 14-16.
In the future, more air traffic controllers in Worms
The University of Worms continues to breathe: The "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" is a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
With the professorship there is the possibility to make the start of the study possible not only in the summer semester, but also in the winter semester.
This allows twice as many students to be trained as before.
At the same time, capacities are uniformly used both in the university and at the DFS Aviation Academy.
The DFS will advise the university on setting up and occupying the professorship.
Since 2019 represented at the university
Since the summer semester 2019 the first students have been in the Air Traffic Management degree program as part of their training as air traffic controllers at Worms University of Applied Sciences.
This year, nine students have already started.
So far, the experience of the DFS is very positive, the services of the students are excellent.
The combination of study and pilot training contributes significantly to further increase the attractiveness of the pilot profession.
"In these times, funding is not easy for us economically.
However, we expect air traffic to recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to fulfil our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, CEO of DFS at the signing of the contract.
"For DFS, the professorship of the foundation is a future-proofing investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, cross-disciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue the good cooperation with the university and at the same time support our attractiveness as an employer".
Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of the University of Worms, said: "The professorship of the foundation forms an important bridge between science and business.
With it, we would like to link up with the existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual Bachelor’s programme in Air Traffic Management”.
The confidence of the German air traffic control system is both motivation and commitment for the University of Worms to further develop its teaching and research expertise in the future fields of air transport.
In use for the air traffic controllers of tomorrow, the university can set very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students with the first professorship of the foundation for a dual degree program.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Continuing Education and Culture, emphasises: "The University of Worms has a unique position in Rhineland-Palatinate with its focus on air transport.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university".
Rescue helicopter lands on the A 45
Around 30 minutes, the A 45 motorway was fully closed on Saturday afternoon towards Aschaffenburg, as after a traffic accident the rescue helicopters were in operation.
A 76-year-old man drove a Ford at 12.40 in the Alzenau-Mitte exit in the curve and landed at the control plank.
The impact triggered the front airbags, the driver suffered minor injuries to the face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old passenger were taken care of by the emergency doctor and the patient subsequently flew to a hospital with the rescue helicopter.
However, the police now assume that there is no risk of life.
The damaged vehicle, in which a damage of about 2000 euros was incurred, had to be towed.
Heil wants to test other industries by meat industry
The corona crisis once again brought to light the conditions in parts of the meat industry.
Law enforcement is about to come.
But are they right--and will it stay with them?
Federal Minister of Labour Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to check other sectors in accordance with the strict regulations against abuses in the meat industry.
"We will look at the industry for industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," said Heil of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany’s employers are already warning against restricting works contracts in general.
After the massive coronavirus outbreak at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to pass a law of salvation this Wednesday.
Large slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to employ foreign personnel in slaughtering, cutting and meat processing.
For this purpose, the use of works contract and temporary workers is to be prohibited there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer said the dpa "fingers away from a general limitation of work contracts and employee layovers if one does not want to completely slash the economy".
Works contracts are, for example, the basis for their value creation at the customer for a wide range of trades, the construction industry and plant construction.
"The faults of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument".
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban works contracts anywhere in the German economy".
Work contracts are useful.
"If an industrial company commissions a craftsman to install a safety facility, this is a completely normal work contract".
The German meat industry considers a ban on works contracts and temporary work to be unconstitutional in its industry alone.
It would not be explanatory as to why, in the future, different labour law should be applied to the portioning and packaging of cheese than to sausages, according to a statement on the legislative proposal, as reported by the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday).
In the event of a ban, the consumer price would increase by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
Many Eastern European employees from works contract companies worked in the industry partly 16 hours a day, according to the results of an audit by the NRW Labour Protection Administration.
They often didn’t have a break.
Wages have been retained for protective equipment or rent.
It was also found that the situation at the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said a relatively sharp law came into force for the meat industry as early as 2017.
Through "trick-rich constructions", however, these were bypassed.
"Now must be thoroughly cleaned up".
The politician announced: "In the Labour Protection Act, which we want to decide in the cabinet at the end of July, measures that not only affect the meat industry are also measures - for example, higher test rates in the field of occupational safety or clear criteria for community accommodation".
The present draft of the dpa includes amendments to the law on the safeguarding of workers’ rights in the meat industry as well as the Occupational Safety and Health Act.
Brandenburg’s Minister of Consumer Protection Ursula Nonnemacher (Green) considers more intensive controls necessary.
"I would like us to be able to make even more controls in many areas of supervision: food controls, animal welfare, everything possible, for example animal transport," said Nonnemacher on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg aktiv".
However, more staffing is also needed for more checks.
Three dead in crash of ultralight aircraft in Germany
Three people died in the crash of an ultralight aircraft onto a multi-family house in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, according to police.
A child was slightly injured.
Two more people were rescued injured in the accident, said a spokesman for the Wesel district headquarters.
A parachute was found at the scene of the accident, police said.
The "Rheinische Post" reported, citing eyewitnesses, that before the crash the plane had collided with a hot air balloon.
The house is a one- or two-family house.
Further details were not known at first.
eviction of Frankfurt Opera Square peacefully
A week after the riots in Frankfurt, the eviction of the opera square at night to Sunday has also been peaceful.
Finally, a few dozen people stayed in the square, but left him at 1 a.m. before the start of the lockdown.
The police had been in operation since the early evening with numerous officials, a larger police order was seen throughout the city area.
For the first time this weekend, from midnight on, there was a restraining order for the opera square, on which it had come to riots a week ago.
Police officers had been attacked with bottles from the crowd of the celebrations.
At least five officers were injured after police input, several police vehicles were damaged.
The night of Saturday was also quiet.
Car hits itself: Young woman seriously injured in accident on Bundesstra<0xC3><0x9F>e 83 near Hofgeismar
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old suffered serious injuries on Sunday around 1:25 p.m.
She was taken to Kassel Hospital.
With thermal imaging cameras, the fire department was looking for possible passengers.
According to police, the woman was on the road 83 towards her place of residence, Hümme, when her car came off the road from an unexplained cause and struck several times.
To save the injured, the fire department had to cut the roof of the car.
Since it was unclear if anyone was still in the vehicle, the adjacent cornfield was searched by the rotary conductor with a thermal imaging camera.
The drone squadron from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, had also been ordered for passenger searches.
However, the emergency forces did not find anyone between the high corn plants.
The seriously injured person was taken to the Kassel Clinic for further care with the ambulance.
Nearly 50 firefighters from Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg were on site.
The federal highway was closed for two hours due to the accident.
Juventus Turin Masters in Italy
Turin - After a redemptive goal by Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in series.
The team around the five-time World Footballer made the 36th Scudetto in the history of the club perfect with a 2-0 (1:0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo hit 1-0 before halftime.
With 83 points, Turin, which started without the last long-lost former national player Sami Khedira, is no longer in place two days before the end of the Serie A season.
Inter Milan’s table second is seven points behind.
Juventus was harmless in the first half despite optical superiority, then Ronaldo met with the last action after a free kick variant.
A play by Miralem Pjanic earned the 35-year-old from the penalty area limit directly with a flat shot (45.+7).
Against the now more offensive guests, Ronaldo was also involved in 2-0, after his shot, Federico Bernardeschi (67th) dusted off.
This ensured a brilliant but decisive success.
The Foulelfmeter shot to the Latte in the 89th minute probably only Ronaldo himself, with a view to the Torj<0xC3><0xA4>ger rating, correctly owned.
"It's complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball level for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum changes very easily," said coach Maurizio Sarri after 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Above all, the mental exhaustion of his players is great, said the Juve coach.
Because of the defeat, the Turinese had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
Juve’s final advantage at the top of the table was mainly due to the weakness of his competitors.
Because in the eleven games before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team had only five wins.
Whether Ronaldo will also become a goalkeeper king is questionable.
Because while the Portuguese superstar scored 31 goals so far, the former Dortmund Ciro Immobile has already scored 34 goals in his account after his three-pack at 5:1 (1:1) of the table-four Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of FC Bayern.
The record in Italy is held by current juve pro Gonzalo Higua<0xC3><0xAD>n.
The Argentinian scored 36 goals for the SSC Napoli in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the "Old Lady" of Italian football is waiting for the next title chance.
Juventus is in the final of the Champions League, but on August 7 against Olympique Lyon, he must make a 0-1 draw to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next knockout round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as opponents.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all threatened penalties and court sentences, drivers continue to gas in countless illegal races on the Baden-Württemberg streets: last year and the first four months of this year, police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
There are no comparable figures for the years before, but the racers are increasingly making work for the judicial authorities: In 2018 a total of 155 investigations were conducted for illegal races in the public prosecutor’s offices between Konstanz and Mannheim, a year later it was already 252 and in the current year to the beginning of June it was already 151.
The races were less about organized events, as the interior ministry’s response to a request from the Landtags SPD shows.
In most cases, the drivers had spontaneously run into each other or they had taken the escape from the police - this is also shown as an illegal race.
German men between the ages of 18 and 60 were mainly in the driver’s seat.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the lawn mowers caught and also asked for cash: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 prison sentences have been issued.
However, there is no evidence that the number of illegal car races actually rose.
Rather, due to the numerous tragic accidents and processes of past years, other drivers responded more sensitively than before and showed more frequently, a ministry spokesman said.
Motorway 8 is particularly popular with racers and drivers are constantly slowing down traffic there to make room for themselves and use the free track for a race.
Last August a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim under Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 riders on the A8 near Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "race track"
On the A81, the police register even more races than on any other federal highway.
A speed limit is used to try to brake the lawns on the particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and upholstered sports and luxury cars often have Swiss characteristics, because the drivers dodge to the lawn in Germany because of the high penalties for too fast driving and racing in the neighbouring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few distances: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour, we would be able to solve this problem on motorways," says Martin Rivoir, the transport expert of the SPD National Day Group.
"The barrier threshold for lawn mowers would be significantly higher if you weren't here and there still legally with 200 kilometers per hour and more on the road."
Rivoir said: “Anyone who in this way ignores all the rules and puts not only his own life, but also the lives of other road users at risk is hardly attainable with reason.”
ADAC calls for stronger police intervention
The ADAC, on the other hand, is not enough: "We assume that Raser will not be deterred by the speed limits," says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at ADAC Württemberg.
It requires additional and also harder checks on the affected routes.
From January 2019 until April 2020, three people died in the races nationwide, two of them uninvolved in a nighttime crash in Stuttgart’s city centre and one in Gerlingen.
In November, two young men were expected to win a car race.
One of the vehicles came off the road, bounced against a garden wall and stayed on the side, which died 18-year-old passenger.
Twenty-one more people have been injured in the race over the past two years.
However, according to Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, tougher penalties are not necessary: “Legislative action needed to sanction illegal motor vehicle races harder is not seen,” says the paper of the Interior Ministry.
Bluelight of July 23: Thirsty burglar steals drinks from snack
Rohrdorf: A man broke into a snack in Rohrdorf (Kreis Calw) on Thursday and stole drinks and cash.
A witness heard noises in the valley road at about 3.40 a.m. and ran towards the snack.
There he noticed a man who served himself at the fridge with drinks and then left the snack through a previously knocked-in front door.
The perpetrator fled in the direction of the meadows behind the snack.
According to police, the burglar also served at a cash desk and stole cash in the low three-digit range.
The suspect is described as follows: he is about 1.75 to 1.80 meters tall and of strong stature.
In fact, he wore a black hoodie, black pants and bright shoes.
Further witness notices are received by the police.
Ackermann sprints to victory on final stage at Sibiu Tour
On the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour, cycling pro Pascal Ackermann won his second day's victory.
The 26-year-old Palatinate from Team Bora-hansgrohe was on the 109-kilometer section with start and finish in Hermannstadt in the mass sprint after winning a stage already on Saturday.
It was season three and four for Ackermann.
In the overall ranking, his Austrian teammate Gregor Mühlberger prevailed.
In the morning, the 26-year-old had confidently chosen the mountain time trial for himself and thus took the lead in the classification.
Only 104 drivers had entered the final stage in the evening.
No fewer than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in mountain riding.
“I’m really happy to start the season restart with a win,” Ackermann explained after his success on Saturday.
“The sprint was really hectic,” said the 26-year-old.
300 meters before the goal, he simply put on his sprint, "and it worked perfectly."
In accordance with the rules of the World Association of UCI, a corona test was carried out for all race participants and their companions six days before the start of the race.
During the entire tour, drivers and caretakers were separated from the organization team and the media in isolated hygiene bubbles.
Viewers at the start and finish were not allowed.
The head office gave instructions on lay reanimation
Düsseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in Düsseldorf-Garath.
In a multi-family house, a child (4) was suddenly in the water while bathing.
According to the fire department, the emergency call came at just before 1 p.m.
“A control point dispatcher immediately gave instructions on lay reanimation,” a fire brigade spokesman told BILD.
The incoming rescuers took the resuscitation measures a little later.
The child who is at risk of life was transported to the Uniklinik under reanimation.
Why it crashed is unclear.
The police routinely took up the investigation into the accident.
The fireman: "We're starting from a tragic accident in the apartment".
Nuremberg: Unapproved Tuning Meeting - Police intervene, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and temporarily over 1,000 people took part in a “tuning meeting” on Saturday night in the parking lot of a furniture house.
The police implemented their announcement to control such events more strongly.
A big tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (25 July 2020) in Nuremberg’s southern city.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to Mittelfranken police, an increased vehicle volume in the area of a large parking lot in Ingolst<0xC3><0xA4>dter Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e was detected at around 10.30 a.m. by the Nuremberg Transport Police.
The police then carried out a large number of vehicle checks.
Only recently, the police had announced that they wanted to act more strongly against so-called autoposers.
Illegal Tuning Meetings in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
The officers numbered at the top about 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, the police accounted for.
Of this, however, only a small part of those present are to be assigned to the "autoposer" and tuning scene.
Apparently, most of the relevant scene followed the call of the police.
On the basis of the vehicles and persons present on site, it should be assumed that these were mainly visual.
In addition, the vast majority of those present adhered to the current infection protection regulations, in particular the observance of the minimum distance and the wearing of a mouth-nose protection.
The on-site control measures were completed at around 1:00 a.m.
In total, the officials of 10 vehicles found such structural changes that the operating permit had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car races
There were no illegal car races.
"The Central Franconia Police Bureau will continue to keep an eye on what is happening and will continue to carry out enhanced control measures, including in connection with the emergence of illustrious people," it said.
The agency News5 spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger of the participating towing company: "They have all beautiful rims, we must not scratch them," Schrödinger said.
Special bands would be used for this.
Also because the cars are wider, the company needs to make sure not to make any damage.
"The young people should finally get their cars back undamaged".
Employment Agency figures: 900 suspected cases of abuse in short-term work
Berlin - According to its own statement, the Federal Agency for Labour (BA) investigates around 900 suspected cases of abuse in the short-time worker’s allowance.
“This is extremely low for more than 880,000 companies that have indicated short-term work,” said Daniel Terzenbach, the executive board responsible for the operational business, of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
When at the beginning of the corona crisis suddenly many companies applied for short-term work, the BA had to react quickly.
Usually, the test lasts up to three weeks.
"So much time was not available to us in this hot phase.
All the more closely we will look at the final accounts.
I'm sure there'll be a lot more to come.
We are not na<0xC3><0xAF>ve and have a long breath.”
Evidence of abuse often comes from the affected employees or unions.
In addition, use the BA analysis software to detect abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible insolvency threshold in the autumn.
Will there be more insolvencies than in the previous year?
The assessments differ, but we are arming ourselves in the case of the case and are already training our employees in the employment agencies for the processing of applications for insolvency money."
The numbers are still inconspicuous, Terzenbach said.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party in the New Garden Dissolved
Potsdam - On Friday evening, about 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
The collection was disbanded at 8.48 a.m. by the Reverends of the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the foundation informed on PNN request.
The kids left the park.
On Saturday evening, some youths would have played rugby in the New Garden.
The meadow was cleared by aviators, said SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee on Sunday.
There are always illegal celebrations in the parks.
In the parks of the foundation there are always gatherings where the distance and hygiene rules Covid-19 bypass regulations are not complied with.
At the end of June there was a celebration with about 300 people in the park Babelsberg, a week later about 150 people celebrated in the New Garden.
Even without a corona ordinance, the parks will be closed when darkness breaks in.
Storage on the meadows is prohibited according to parking regulations, there are few exceptions.
The foundation has long complained that visitors would leave more and more waste and destroy protected biotopes.
Meanwhile, illegal park parties have reached a different dimension in Berlin.
In the Hasenheide district of Neukölln, 5,000 people celebrated an illegal techno party on Sunday night.
The event was disbanded by the police.
Austria: Mass tests after Corona outbreak in tourist resort
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist resort of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases rose to 48, according to the state authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still available in the evening.
According to this, many of the infected young interns are in tourism establishments, but at least one holiday guest has also been tested positively.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodations on Saturday evening.
The lockdown time was set at 23 o'clock.
"There are cancellations and cancellations" of bookings, said the head of the tourism association Wolfgangsee, Hans Wieser, the dpa.
Some guests have also left early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist resort in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, about a third of the guests are German.
On Friday, the first infections became public.
The head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended on Saturday the behavior of the interns who had celebrated in several locales and may have been infected there.
“We all liked to do that in our youth,” he told the radio station <0xC3><0x96>1.
However, on Friday, two bars were closed to prevent further infections.
The Tourism Association launched an information campaign to raise awareness of the dangers of COVID-19 among young employees.
As of Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from 15 July were contacted.
The outbreak evokes memories of the Austrian ski and party resort of Ischgl in Tyrol, which in the early stages of the pandemic was a center of Corona spread throughout Europe.
In total, more than 1,500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
The focus of the new infections is Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - English football record champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year of absence.
On the last day of the Premier League, the Red Devils secured third place by a 2-0 (0:0) victory against direct competitor Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to settle for the Europa League because FC Chelsea were still passing by and also qualified for the King's class as fourth.
In the fight against the descent, Aston Villa was allowed to cheer.
Manchester United were led by Bruno Fernandes (71th minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in the replay time, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) hit the finish line.
Chelsea, in the Champions League final opponent of FC Bayern, won 2-0 (2-0) against the Wolverhampton Wanderers thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4).
“That means a lot to me,” said coach Frank Lampard, who is also in his first season as a Chelsea coach in the final of the FA Cup against Arsenal.
Chelsea's victory against Wolverhampton also benefited Tottenham Hotspur, who with a lean 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace still passed the Wolves and started as sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa decided the distance duel with FC Watford and AFC Bournemouth on their own, but had to tremble for a long time at West Ham United for class preservation.
The late leadership of Jack Grealish (84th) immediately equalled Andrej Jarmolenko (85th).
The 1:1 (0:0) was enough, however, because Watford lost 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.
The club, which scored three coaches in the season, will retire after five first league years.
Just like Bournemouth, who couldn’t save himself by a 3:1 (2:1) at Everton.
In the end, there was a missing point.
Liverpool FC, who have been established as an English champion since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3:1 (1:1) win at Newcastle United.
99 is the highest score the Reds have ever scored in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team narrowly missed the points record in English football.
The top brand holds Manchester City with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) made the game for Liverpool on Sunday.
"For this wonderful club, it was an extraordinary season," said goalkeeper van Dijk after the game, "which should spur us to defend the title.
It's going to be hard."
It is also likely that the Premier League boss will be happy.
Due to the coronavirus crisis, football operations in England were interrupted from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, it was even discussed about an early cancellation or a performance of the remaining games on neutral ground.
After all, the season could be played without special events at the end - but as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence in demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Prime Minister Netanyahu are becoming increasingly violent.
At night, there were violent clashes.
Israeli police have violently taken part in a demonstration against right-wing Conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Sunday night.
Twelve people were arrested for participating in riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
Among other things, the police used water cannons to dissolve the rally.
In total, according to media reports on Saturday evening, some 6,000 people had gathered near Netanyahu’s office.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu’s handling of the coronavirus crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew horns and called on Netanyahu to resign.
Participants were also arrested in an area demonstration that supported Netanyahu, the news site reported "ynet".
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the private mansion of the head of government in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested near Tel Aviv after police reported that he was suspected of spraying pepper spray on streetside protesters from a driving car.
Another man was arrested after a mass attack on a demonstrator in the south of the country.
The protestor was slightly injured in the neck.
There have been several demonstrations against Netanyahu in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
The rallies accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Netanyahu has also been criticized for his handling of the coronavirus crisis.
Among other things, he is given pre-fast relaxation and a lack of preparation for a second corona wave.
The coronavirus crisis has severely increased the country’s economy.
The last unemployment rate was more than 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the coronavirus in Israel has recently risen to new record levels.
Accident at Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter force on car - nine injured - Ruhrgebiet - Bild.de
Ahlen - A start-up accident on Saturday afternoon at the B58 at Ahlen called for nine slightly injured.
A driver was traveling with her two children (3, 5) towards Beckum.
Police said, “She was probably suddenly slowed down because she wanted to turn down.”
The driver of a Mercedes transporter who drove behind her must have seen it too late.
He pushed on the back of the car.
In the accident, three occupants in the car and six in the transporter were slightly injured.
Several ambulances took them to a nearby hospital.
North Korea clears border city after Corona suspect case
North Korea has seen a "bright success" in its own measures to ward off the coronavirus.
The country is now reporting a suspected case for the first time.
Because of a first official corona suspicion in the country, North Korea has completely shut down a major city for fear of disaster.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defense measures in the past six months, “the malignant virus could have been introduced into the country,” the state media reported.
For the region around the border city of Kaesong, the state of emergency has been imposed.
The Communist leadership called for the highest level of alarm.
Should the suspected case be confirmed, it would be the first official case of Sars-CoV-2 infection in the isolated country.
North Korea had not yet registered a single infection and described its defense measures as a "bright success".
The information was doubted abroad.
The disease symptoms were reported to have been detected by an "outlier" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person moved to South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
For the border crossing within the four-kilometre-wide and largely mined military buffer zone, there was initially no confirmation from South Korea.
South Korea’s military, however, acknowledged the possibility of an illegal border crossing to North Korea as high, according to reports from the national news agency Yonhap.
Investigations were carried out on some people.
North Korea said on Saturday it had called an emergency meeting of the Workers’ Party Politburo chaired by Kim Jong Un.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive disaster".
Kim has already ordered on Friday as a preventative measure "to completely block Kaesong and isolate each district and region from others," it said.
The person concerned, as well as all the people in Kaesong who had been in contact with her, had been quarantined.
The central military commission of the party is therefore to investigate the "outage case" as well as the conduct of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose severe punishment.
It is estimated that about 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Tensions ahead of Council meeting: City East and noise protection are still at a great summer break for discussion
"In addition to environmental issues, the members of the committee will also vote on the building plan for the large-scale project downtown development east," the city press release said on Tuesday, July 28, at 4.30 p.m. in the Great Hall of Congress Centre Pforzheim.
In particular, the appreciation of the eastern city is controversially debated until the end.
Majorities are scarce, most recently in individual committees, depending on their presence.
An appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT) that the project developed from the bourgeoisie and then from the administration and municipal council now does not fail after almost ten years of preparation, criticized project opponent Reinhard Klein as "outside parliamentary opposition", "unprecedented", "speculation", "denigration" and "conscious false statements".
"Everyone thinks they know better," said Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for a year as the sole representative of the Pforzheim citizen list.
In fact, after reading the contracts, he was in this position: "I know what I'm talking about".
The exit will be cheaper for the city, the Technical City Hall is in opposition to statements from the city administration according to grants, whose existence Klein is convinced to renovate for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop quite differently than forecasted in the town hall and by the proponents of the economy.
The FDP/FW/UB/LED group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept to the city through its own strength and not an investor: this is his plan B. One day after Klein.
It also essentially provides for the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the opening of the Schlo<0xC3><0x9F>berg, the rental of the ex-thal for administrative areas and a smaller downtown conversion ideally with local carriers.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
Among other things, the council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzheim population from health noise pollution caused by road traffic, including many temporary reductions.
In a press release, the local transport club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this must come about because they have contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise by neglecting bus service with thinned-out cycles and by little commitment to cycling, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
It is also on the agenda of the accession to the climate protection pact of the state of Baden-Württemberg, the re-establishment of parental contributions in the municipal day-care facilities and the application for admission to the Smart City funding of the federal government.
Citizens are welcome, but need to abide by Corona protection measures.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
With almost half a year of delay, Tim Zimmermann will start his premiere season at the ADAC GT Masters on July 31st.
Before the league of super sports cars can start the regular operation, the first test drives were now underway.
For Zimmermann, it was all about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 in more detail.
The Corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from taking his first service ride in Grasser Racing’s new Lamborghini Huracan.
Under special hygiene conditions, this was now possible.
The 23-year-old Langenargener made his first laps on the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
“There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche of the preseason,” says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go in the curves differently.
But it really was a lot of fun."
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite his only 25 years of experience in GT sports, the Dutchman has been able to help his new teammate in many things.
“I’m not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series also brings new challenges,” says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I understand each other blindly and we have made enormous progress at the Lausitzring from session to session".
Right there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also perform its first race.
From 31 July, the 33 super sports cars will race through the Lausitz.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 series newcomers, knows the track.
In 2015 he was the last guest in the Motodrome.
"It worked quickly and I didn't have to get used to the track," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen racing community Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to hit optimally to be fast".
How fast Zimmermann is then really, that turns out in two weeks.
“The teams are playing poker a little bit during the tests,” he says.
"Finally, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring".
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a tight-knit calendar.
There will be seven races by the beginning of November.
The current state is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring, ex-Formel-1 pilot Niko Hülkenberg will reach the GT steering wheel.
British Transport Minister Coldly Captured by Quarantine Decision
The British government’s decision to quarantine Spain’s holidaymakers for two weeks after their return has coldly caught the country’s Minister of Transport, according to press reports.
Grant Shapps is currently on holiday in Spain, while his colleagues decided on the measure at home on Saturday.
Due to the corona numbers rising again in Spain, the London Cabinet removed the country from the list of countries from which entry without quarantine is possible.
The new regulation will apply from today, Sunday, so that Shapps will also have to quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the regulation applies to those who are just on holiday on the deadline date, only from Saturday, August 1st, and was not introduced overnight.
In Austria, by the way, Spain is still considered one of the "safe countries" for which no quarantine is needed in Austria.
"Several ministers may have known in advance that there is a possibility that a quarantine will be imposed for holidaymakers in Spain," said Labour MP Diane Abbot.
"But apparently no one has bothered to tell Grant Shapps".
Nearly a month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the expiration of the strict curfew, the number of infections in the country is rising again.
Virologists primarily blame the nightlife for the new spread.
Spain is one of the UK’s most popular holiday destinations.
The British government is currently advising against non-necessary travel to the Spanish mainland, with the exception of particularly popular Canary Islands and Balearic Islands.
To date, more than 272,000 infections with the novel coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths have been recorded in Spain.
Russia: Navy Day: Putin announces hypersonic weapons for warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on the day of the Navy in his country an equipment of warships with state-of-the-art hypersonic weapons.
With these weapons unique in the world, the fighting opportunities of the Russian naval forces would be expanded, Putin said at the central naval parade in St. Petersburg on Sunday.
According to the Defense Ministry, the Interfax agency also informed about successful tests of the zircon hypersonic missile built for the Navy.
The hypersonic weapons have a multiple of the sound speed of about 343 meters per second.
They are considered weapons of the future.
Underwater Tropedeo is still being built
The building will also be built on the nuclear-equipped underwater torpedo Poseidon, it said.
The planned seed drone is planned to destroy coastal targets.
The president, who himself also rode a military boat, said that this year alone 40 new ships would be put into service at the individual fleet associations of the largest country on earth.
Russia has such a large coastal area as no other country in the world.
For 300 years, the Navy has been protecting Russia reliably, Putin said on the day celebrated by sailors nationwide.
Also in many other Russian coastal towns, the naval forces began the day of the navy with parades.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated strength at a gun show in the Mediterranean port of Tartu.
Ammunition was also fired there.
A video released by the Ministry of Defence showed not only warships, including a submarine, but also fighter helicopters and jets.
Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: aid made difficult due to coronavirus
Washington - The first hurricane of this year's season over the Atlantic has landed in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and heavy rains now threatened parts of the U.S. state, the National Hurricane Center of the U.S. Climate Agency (NOAA) said at night on Sunday (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency for numerous districts.
The Texas-grabbing coronavirus pandemic complicates the work of the helpers, Abbott continued, according to US media.
Evacuates called for caution
“Every hurricane is a huge challenge,” Abbott said, according to the Houston Chronicle newspaper.
Looking at the Texas cyclone, he added, “This challenge is complicated and even more aggravated, considering that it sweeps through an area that is the state’s most affected by Covid-19.”
According to Johns Hopkins University, about 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
Abbott called on people who had to leave their homes to be cautious.
They should not disregard practices "to which we have become accustomed," such as wearing masks, the governor said, according to CBS.
It is important that everyone stays at a distance.
Therefore, hotel rooms were also provided in some places.
In addition, in emergency shelters should be tested for corona.
Damages were initially reported only from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning taken back
With wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, according to authorities, "Hanna" was hit ashore on the island of Padre Island just off the Texas coast.
The tropical storm had previously been elevated to the lowest level one hurricane.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm surge warning had been issued and later taken back.
Authorities expected a slowdown, while "Hanna" continued to move into the interior of the country and headed north-east Mexico.
"Douglas" moves to Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurricane "Douglas" was traveling towards Hawaii at night on Sunday with wind speeds of around 150 kilometers per hour.
The hurricane center, however, expected it to weaken further.
It is said to be near Hawaii’s largest islands on Sunday (local time) – then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
Over the Atlantic, NOAA expected an above-average active hurricane season this year, according to a May prediction.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes could be expected, of which up to six could become very strong cyclones, the agency said.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year across the Atlantic, three of which develop into storms of great strength.
Given available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season was only 30 percent, an under-average even at 10 percent, it said at the time.
US President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that his government is watching the storms closely and is in contact with the affected states.
Four goals conceded: video assistant "punished" Sassuolo
Sassuolos Filip Djuricic was immediately denied two goals
Naples - Four goals scored, four goals conceded: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a rabid evening at 0:2 (0:1) at the SSC Naples in the Italian football league Serie A - and was really angry at the video assistant of the referee.
"A festival not given gates for Sassuolo.
The VAR has never been so hard on a team,” said Corriere dello Sport.
Host Naples had gone through a goal by outside defender Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute in charge, in the 32nd minute Filip Djuric initially applauded the compensation.
The video Assistant Referee (VAR) took the hit back because of an off position.
Five minutes later, Djuric shot the ball back into the net - again the VAR intervened.
The goals of the attackers Francesco Caputo (50) and Domenico Berardi (61) also took back the referee team, according to the VAR.
In the replay, Allan made the 2-0 finish for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.
"The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the road and punishes Sassuolo like no team before.
The new technology provides records," writes the "Gazzetta dello Sport".
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start into the hot preparation phase for the Champions League started for Double winner FC Bayern with a setback.
After a short vacation and a few days of training, Hansi Flick has to think about how he can rebuild his successful defence after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who is behind Captain Manuel Neuer and midfielder Joshua Kimmich for the third-most minutes of service, suffered a ligament injury to the left foot root and threatens to be missing in decisive king-class duels.
In Munich’s Schmuddelwetter, the right-hand defender broke off a training game and was driven off the course with a golf card.
How long the full-time regular player has to pause in the battle for the title is open.
A bet in the eighth-final return match against Chelsea on August 8 is likely to be difficult, and the 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament starting on August 12 in Lisbon.
The Bavarians do not want to let themselves be stopped by the mishap from training on Sunday.
In his personal triple formula, Flick named the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on his way to Portugal’s capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration are expected to show its victorious title collectors in the 28 days that follow, ideally, until the King's Class Final on August 23.
"We have mastered the duties with championship and cup just outstandingly.
Now it’s time to create something special,” Flick said.
Until the Munichers can deal with the final tournament and before a training camp on the Algarve, but the first time the eight-final obligation against FC Chelsea is up.
After the 3-0 in the run-up to the Corona break, the Londoners in the domestic arena should not become the Bayern nightmare again as in the lost "Final dahoam" 2012.
“We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and build trust with a good game,” Flick said.
A test of vote is scheduled for Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn in his stars, who had 13 days of vacation after the Double, on a one-off August.
He welcomed 31 players on S<0xC3><0xA4>bener Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e, including the new players for noble shopping Leroy Sané, who met all the new colleagues on the pitch for the first time after his transfer from Manchester City.
"Leroy has put himself in good shape like all the new ones," Flick reported.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & Co. can no longer just centralize, Flick preferred to talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small-group training, team strength is now being trained for the Londoners, who are in the rhythm of the game as opposed to the flick ensemble.
After that, Munich could face a quarter-final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semi-finals Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are possible opponents.
One way to the final in Lisbon is "not so easy," the head coach, who from Tuesday on can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training.
The World Cup scorer Klose and Flick know of so many common tournament preparation, which is especially important in the 0-to-100 vote.
With his current team, working is "a pleasure," Flick praised.
“Focusing on winnings” is an impressive trait of his team.
The tournament with Neuner teams was also ambitious on Sunday.
Of the performers, all were present, including the emigrating Thiago and defender David Alaba, whose stay beyond the royal-class season is not guaranteed.
Formula One needs a special rule to select its world champion
Since it is not possible to drive on the required number of continents, the FIA must improvise in order to award the World Cup titles.
All American races were cancelled.
The race calendar is becoming more and more concrete
The racing calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
Three more races were added to the ten confirmed Grand Prix so far during the week.
In October, the Nürburgring will be driven in Germany and Portim<0xC3><0xA3>o, Portugal.
On the first of November, Lewis Hamilton and Co. compete for World Cup points at the Italian traditional circuit in Imola.
As a result, the 2020 race calendar currently comprises 13 races.
“We are pleased that we are continuing to make great progress in completing our plans for the 2020 season,” said Formula 1 boss Chase Carey.
A total of 15 to 18 races will be completed in this extraordinary season in the royal class of motorsport.
Formula 1 is set to finish its season in Asia.
The final race calendar will be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
Before the officially scheduled races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, media reports say there could still be appearances in Vietnam and Malaysia at the end of November.
Rules require races on three continents
However, the Formula 1 regulations require at least races on three continents to be awarded the World Championship.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents are driven, there should be a world champion.
By means of a special rule, the FIA intends to award the titles, citing "exceptional circumstances" due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be cancelled in the short term due to the ongoing coronavirus crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not an issue.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Refusal to Respond to Criticism in Brazil
Due to the tense corona situation, the races will not take place in Canada, the USA, Mexico and Brazil.
“We look forward to being with them again next season,” Carey said.
The rejection of the American race came to criticism in Brazil in particular: "The rejection did not come as a surprise to us, but we cannot accept the reasons for it," said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo.
Thus, the number of infections in the S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo region is significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concerns of some teams not wanting to drive in Brazil would also not justify rejection.
Prepare for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Bad Look Against Donald Trump Went Around the World
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest on Stephen Colbert’s well-known Latenight show via videotape and told in an interview what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Klimaatkivistin Greta Thunberg was a guest on a popular US-Latenight show via video switch.
Among other things, she told us about her fight against the powerful of the world.
She also spoke about her famous “evil look” at her encounter with Donald Trump.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg, with her tireless commitment to the "Fridays For Future" movement, drew attention to herself.
Now, in a well-known Latenight show, she spoke about her plans for the future as well as her meeting with US President Donald Trump at last year’s UN Climate Summit.
Latenight presenter Stephen Colbert greeted 17-year-old Thunberg on Tuesday on your show and conducted a longer interview with the Swede.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world’s powerful.
“There are some things that surprised me,” she said.
“How far people go to steer the focus away from the climate crisis,” she said.
"Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats, just because a group of children are going to the streets," she said.
Heads of state and leading politicians who mock them on social media or even try to silence them, she finds "funny" as she shows the reactions "because they have no other answer to it".
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was approached to a familiar scene in which she took a bitter look behind US President Trump.
At the 2019 UN Climate Summit in New York, for which the activist sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip created a GIF, an animated image that ultimately became one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the U.S. president at the time?
To Stephen Colbert’s relatively open question, she replied only briefly and dryly: “To be honest, I don’t think that requires any further explanation.”
The experienced satirist Colbert probably did not expect the decisive answer and disappeared from the picture with a short laugh.
With her "How dare you?" speech on the principles of climate protection, she was remembered by many at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmunder Immobilie with three pack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobile is now in the race for Europe’s Golden Shoe on the same level as Bayern’s Robert Lewandowski.
The former Dortmund Ciro Immobile has the best chance of becoming the goalkeeper king in the Italian football championship.
The former BVB professional contributed three hits in the 5:1 (1:1) victory of Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona, including two converted penalty meters in the replay times of both halves.
This means that the 30-year-old from the fourth round of the table now has 34 goals in his account before the end – just as many of them scored by Robert Lewandowski from FC Bayern Munich in the past Bundesliga season.
In Italy Cristiano Ronaldo follows with so far 30 goals, the Portuguese superstar met with the top rider in the evening still on Sampdoria Genoa.
Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green has died
His life was like a rollercoaster ride: after a rapid ascent with Fleetwood Mac, it went steeply downhill and then slowly back up again.
Blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Brilliant guitarist, drug junkie, cult supporter: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, family members said in an official statement on Saturday that another statement would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton praised Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional response of a "monumental loss" for all former and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had founded the now legendary band in London in 1967, to this day his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross".
The life of the musician ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") was like a rollercoaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
There was, among other things, a dispute because Green wanted to donate all the profits of the group for charitable purposes.
He began to appear in wide robes and with great crucifix.
Mental problems should also have played a role.
Three years after its founding, Green left the band in 1970.
This was followed by a social decline.
The blues rock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, biographers reported.
For a long time, Green was treated in psychiatry.
During much of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the picture area.
He is said to have lived on the street for some time, worked as a cemetery gardener, and spent some time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 as the son of a Jewish working-class family in the Bethnal Green district of London.
At a young age, he was enthusiastic about American blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven, he learned the first guitar grips.
At the age of 15, the teenager started playing professional guitar and five years later got the chance to be a lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners on stage.
A little later, he was hired as a replacement for his idol Eric Clapton at the Bluesbreakers.
In the middle of the Blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 along with his Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green gave the group the first number one hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid ascent soon showed its dark sides: Green did not cope with the media buzz, his experiments with the drug LSD became increasingly extreme.
He later commented on the life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is the drugs - the best thing was to land a number 1 hit."
