AM in Wales is worried about "appearing like puckon"
Some AM, members of the Wales National Assembly, are confused by a proposal to change their title to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the Wales Parliament).
The proposal comes after plans to change the name of the National Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
AM across the political spectrum is worried about being mocked.
An AM for Labour said his group was worried because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers who don’t know Welsh: Twp means dumb in Welsh and pwp means babe.
An AM for Plaid said the group was generally "unsatisfied" and has proposed other options.
A conservative Welshman said his group is "open" to the name change, but pointed out that it was a short step from MWP to Mupp.
In this context, W in Welsh is pronounced like the letter U in English in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently compiling legislation for the name change, said: “The final decision for what members of the congregation should be called is so clearly up to the members themselves.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which found strong support for calling the Assembly the Parliament of Wales.
Regarding the title of AM, the Commission proposed Welsh Parliament Members (members of the Wales Parliament) or WMP, but the MWP received the greatest support in a public consultation.
AM apparently suggests other options, but problems with reaching a consensus can cause problems for Presiding Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the change within a few weeks.
The legislation for the amendments also includes other changes to the way the congregation works, including rules for the disqualification of an AM and the design of the committee system.
AM may vote on what to call them when they debate the legislation.
Macedonia to hold a referendum to change the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is an attempt to end a dispute that has been going on for decades with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighbouring country represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly protested against its attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov opposes the referendum on the name change and has said that he will disregard the result.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the name change is the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The clocks in St. Martin's silence when the churches in Harlem encounter problems
"Older people I'm talking to say there was a bar and a church on every corner before," Mr Adams said.
“There is neither now nor now.”
He said it's understandable that the bars are disappearing.
“People are hanging out in different ways these days,” he said.
“Bars are not like the living room of the area anymore, where people go on a regular basis.”
Regarding the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not be enough as far as the leaders expect and that "early or later they will end up on the box one again".
He also pointed out that churches can be replaced by apartment buildings with owner-occupied apartments filled by people who do not help the remaining churches.
"The absolute majority of people who buy apartments in the buildings will be white," he said. "This will eventually lead to the closure of all the churches, because those who move into the apartments probably will not become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community 1870, St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had a church nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of stores on 125th Street, a shopping street in Harlem, which refused to employ or carry black people.
The building was seriously damaged in a fire in 1939, but when Pastor Johnson's congregation planned the renovation, they also built the clock game.
Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson’s son and successor at St. Martin’s, proudly called the music game “the bells of the poor.”
The expert who played the clock game in July had another name for it: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world’s first clock game played by a black musician – Dionisio A. Lind, who moved on to the larger clock game at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's didn't replace him.
The events of recent months at St. Martin’s are a complicated history of architects and entrepreneurs – some of whom were hired by the church’s laymanship, others by the episcopal foundation.
The church meeting – the congregation’s governing body made up of laymen – wrote to the foundation in July and expressed concern that the foundation would “try to transfer the cost” to the church meeting, even though the church meeting had not been involved when the foundation hired architects and contractors.
Some members of the congregation complained of a lack of transparency from the foundation.
Shark injures 13-year-old who dives after lobster in California
On Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who appeared after lobster in California on the first day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack took place just before seven o’clock in the morning, near Beacon’s Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy calling for help and paddled there with a group of others to pull him out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first thought that the boy was just happy to have found a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was screaming, "I've been bitten!"
"I've been bitten!"
When Hammel came to the boy, he noticed that the whole clavicle had worn up.
"I called out to everyone to get out of the water. 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel said.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is stated to be critical.
It is unclear what shark it was.
The lifeguard Larry Giles told the mass media that a shark had seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had been determined that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said the victim suffered trauma damage to his upper torso.
Access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas was blocked for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles mentioned that there are over 135 sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's Enters the UK Beauty Market
Sainsbury's takes on Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with department store-like beauty courses with beauty specialists.
As part of a significant push into the UK beauty market of <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion, which continues to grow despite the fall of the fashion and household market, the larger beauty corridors will be tested in 11 stores across the country and implemented in more stores next year if they are successful.
The investment in the beauty market is part of the supermarket’s attempt to fill the shelves that used to be occupied by TV sets, microwave ovens and household products.
Sainsbury's said they intend to double their beauty range to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing offerings from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space with marked areas, such as in stores like Boots.
The store chain is also relaunching its boutique make-up brand so that most of the products are vegan – which more and more young customers demand.
In addition, perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will test stands at two Sainsbury’s stores – the first stand opened in Croydon in southern London last week and the second will open in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and the trend of buying smaller amounts of food every day in local stores means that supermarkets need to do more to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, has said their stores will look increasingly like department stores in an attempt to fight off cheap stores like Aldi and Lidl with more services and products than food.
Sainsbury's has Argos booths in hundreds of stores and has also acquired a number of Habitat booths since they bought both chains two years ago, which they say has increased food sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt to give beauty and pharmacy departments a facelift failed.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after a dispute over how to distribute the proceeds from Boots' sales in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business with 281 stores to Celesio, who owns Lloyd's Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
They claim that Lloyds would play a role in the plan by adding an expanded range of luxury skin care products, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s commercial manager, said: “We’ve given our beauty walks a new look and a new feel to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who can advise customers.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet every need, and with an appealing environment in agile locations, we are now an alluring beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'sorry' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is “intimidating” that TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulls out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not have time with their brand Truly, with casual wear and accessories.
Their business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
This Morning presenter, 37, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons Den star Peter Jones furious by pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle brand at the last minute – to focus on their new deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was "racing" at an exciting meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday when the TV favorite admitted that her new deal — worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million — meant she was no longer able to focus on their brand Truly, with casual wear and accessories.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby’s estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
When Willoughby, 37, announced she was leaving Truly on Instagram, Jones flew to one of her vacation homes.
One source said: “Truly was clearly Holly’s top priority.
It would be her long-term future for the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw shocked everyone involved.
No one could believe it happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of goods ready to be sold at Marlow headquarters."
Experts believe that This Morning’s decision to withdraw could cost the company millions due to significant investments in everything from pillows and candles to clothing and the risk of further delays in the launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, took the role of chairman in March.
The couple are vacationing together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willoughby will be M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of "I'm a Celebrity" on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We're not commenting on his business."
Tough talk "and then we fell in love"
He joked that the mass media would criticize him for a comment that some would consider “unworthy of a president” and for being so positive about North Korea’s leaders.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in a “news anchor vote”:
"I haven't given up anything."
He said Kim wants a second meeting after Trump hailed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step for North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
But negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the leaders of the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a “corresponding response” from the United States after North Korea’s first disarmament step.
He noted that the United States is instead continuing sanctions designed to maintain the pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech to his supporters.
“It’s going well with North Korea,” he said.
"We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship.”
He said his attempts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results—an end to missile tests, freed hostages, and returned the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his different way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this packed arena, we’d have around 200 people here,” Trump said, pointing to the audience in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake destroy island in Indonesia, hundreds die
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of the Lombok population had lost their homes, it was not declared a state of emergency, which is required for international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they have been very clear that they are not asking for international help, which complicates it all,” Sumbung said.
Saving the children gathers a team to go to Palu, but it is still unclear if foreign staff can work there.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the Natural Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials evaluated the situation in Palu to determine whether international organisations should be allowed to participate in the aid work.
In view of Indonesia’s constant earthquakes, the country is still sadly unprepared for the anger of nature.
Tsunami protection has been built in Aceh, but they are rare on other coastlines.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning had been issued, probably contributed to the loss of life.
Even under perfect conditions, it is a challenge to travel between Indonesia’s many islands.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship that has been anchored in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on promises to improve Indonesia’s worn infrastructure in his election campaign and has spent large sums on roads and rail.
But inadequate funding has plagued Mr. Joko's administration for next year's election.
Mr. Joko is also pressured by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with machetes, bows and other primitive weapons.
Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge confirmed last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal when his team was behind 1-0.
He transferred the ball to the left and scooped a kick against the far pole.
The experiment flew high over the target area towards the upper right corner of the grid.
The ball finally fell over Kepa Arrizabala's hopes and ended up in the net.
“I was just trying to get into a position to access the ball and players like Shaq are always playing forward as much as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and didn't think much about it but just kicked."
Chelsea led 1-0 after the first half after a goal in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue striker poured a pass back to Mateo Kovacic, spun off near the midfield and sprinted to Liverpool's side.
Kovacic made a quick give-and-go at the midfield.
Then he got a great kick that brought Hazard into the finish area.
Hazard ran away from the defense and got the ball in the net at the far pole with a left-footed kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool are fighting against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy at 3 p.m. on Wednesday.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League in London at 3 p.m. on Thursday.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll for the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the country’s disaster agency early on Sunday.
Many people were reported to have been trapped in the rubble of buildings that crashed in the 7.5 earthquake that struck Friday and triggered waves of up to six meters, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with over 380,000 inhabitants, was full of debris from buildings that collapsed.
Police arrest man, 32, suspected of murder after woman is killed
A murder investigation has started after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found stabbed at 7:55 on Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have asked people in the area who saw or heard something to stand out.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "We are at an early stage of the investigation, but I ask everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed something with a car camera to contact us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman found lives in Birkenhead and that the body was found inside a property.
In the afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have arrived at the place to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police inform the victim's immediate relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but the police said no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
The residents of the building have been informed that it takes several hours before they are allowed to enter again.
A police officer told a man that the entire area was treated like a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared on the scene.
She says "it's so horrible" over and over again.
At 2 p.m., two police cars were inside the lockdown and another just outside.
A number of police assistants were inside the lockdown with an overview of the apartment building.
People with information are asked to send a DM to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and enter log 247 from 30 September.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell latest victim for quarrel over rewriting history
A ban would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts performed by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposals "deception" and "try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be drawn into the ongoing debate about removing statues."
The iconoclasm during the English Civil War was neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
Cromwell might be sacrificed for what his ancestor Thomas did 100 years earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell shows the opinion of the 19th century and is part of the historiography of a man that many consider should still be praised.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than now, believe that Cromwell defended Parliament against external pressure, in his case from the monarchy.
Whether this is a correct representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
But the conflict of the mid-17th century has undoubtedly affected the development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known person who represents one side of the matter.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and celebrated.
Killer Pig Kills Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood in a path on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig breeder prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in a pig sled on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He is reported to have travelled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a nearby pigsty was open.
He said there was a big pigtail in the pigtail with blood on his mouth.
A forensic investigation confirmed that the 250-pound pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and distorted," said the cousin identified by the surname Wu to Guiyang Evening News.
A surveillance camera filmed Yuan when he came to the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed the farmer did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked in to avoid further attacks while police were collecting evidence on the spot.
Yuan’s family and those responsible for the market are reported negotiating compensation for his death.
It's rare that pigs attack people, but it's happened before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and caused serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 300 kilos pressed a farmer in Wales against a tractor until his wife scared it away.
When a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a “catalyst”.
“They’re just playful.
They're very curious, they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them respect,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa for extensive heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa becomes weaker as it travels across cooler waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring flooding rain to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa had a wind power of up to 135 km/h, category 1, at five EST on Sunday and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough begins to form across the Pacific Ocean and travels eastward towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it will force deep tropical moisture north into the southwestern United States.
Pink will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture that interacts with the approaching trough will create widespread heavy rain in the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5-10 cm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, mud flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will cause 5–7.5 cm of rain per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5-10 cm of rain is expected in some places in the southwestern United States, especially in much of Arizona.
Sudden flooding is possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the spread of tropical rain.
It is absolutely not recommended that anyone go out in the desert on foot when tropical rain is expected.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into rushing rivers and thunderstorms lead to strong local winds blowing around sand.
The approaching trough brings some local heavy rain to parts of Southern California’s coastline.
It is possible with a total of over a cm of rain, which can lead to mud flows and slippery roads.
It would be the first rain in the area during the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before rain becomes more widespread later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to Four Corner on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
October may mean intense temperature changes throughout the United States, when the Arctic cools down but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes at short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences in the central United States on Sunday.
There is almost ten degrees difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the coming days, the remaining summer heat will try to spread again.
Large parts of the central and eastern United States are expected to get a warm start to October with around 30 degrees from Great Plains to parts of the northeastern United States.
New York can get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be around five degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a high chance of warmer temperatures than the average in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's interrogation
Over 20 million people watched Thursday’s arresting testimony from Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated to the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued and the normal broadcast was cancelled for Friday’s last minute twist – Arizona Senator Jeff Flake’s deal with the FBI where they were given a week to investigate the charge.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is absolutely certain that Kavanaugh was teasing her when he was drunk and trying to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh gave a passionate testimony and said he is absolutely sure it didn’t happen.
It is likely that the number of viewers on Friday was higher than the 20.4 million stated by Nielsen.
They counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN; Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available to other TV networks that showed the interrogation, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble counting people looking from offices.
By comparison, there are as many viewers as for a football match in the playoffs or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose presenters have shown strong support for Kavanaugh’s nomination, had the most viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the day-long interrogation, according to Nielsen.
ABC had the second most with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest was still high after the interrogation.
Flake was in focus during Friday's drama.
After the Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS filmed protesters screaming at him as he tried to take an elevator to an interview with the Judiciary Committee on Friday morning.
He looked down on the floor for several minutes while the protesters shouted at him, which was shown in live broadcast by CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
They also said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the elevator doors were closed he said he would have more to say after the interrogation with the committee.
The television networks broadcast live hours later when the Judiciary Committee voted on whether to pass Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote with the entire Senate.
But Flake said he was only going to do so if the FBI were to investigate the charges against the nominee in the coming week, which the minority Democrats have called for.
Flake was partially convinced by his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had a major impact, as it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of “political games” around Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "political games" about Britain's future and to undermine the nation's interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued her attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other’s customs duties was “completely unreasonable.”
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect for the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed for murder, Baton Rouge police said.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost their glasses in the battle.
Police found the glasses on the spot and found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After interrogation with Simpson, the police said he confessed to killing Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to Advocate.
The East Baton Rouge Parish doctor released a preliminary report last Friday, according to which the cause of death was a gunshot wound in the head and into the neck.
The police thank the Louisiana State Police's escape mission force, the police's state law lab, Southern University police, and residents of the area for help with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their “flesh and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98-metre-long forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "crossed" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“You’re worried about this all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano spews ash over Mexico City
Ashes from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern part of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity had been detected in the crater and they recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash over the course of 24 hours.
The center discovered several mussels and shells.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on windscreens in areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity in the volcano standing 72 km southeast of the capital since an earthquake of 7.1 hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists for the anniversary of independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with riot police while thousands attended rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists who were held back by Kravallpolis threw eggs and color powder on them, leading to dark dust clouds on streets that are usually full of tourists.
Battles also broke out later in the day and police used their batons to stop them.
For several hours, the independence groups shouted "never forget, never forgive" while the Unionists shouted "long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor injuries caused by the protests, according to local pressure.
The mood is still tense in the region that longs for independence one year after the referendum on the first October which was considered illegal by Madrid but hailed by Catalan separatists.
An overwhelming majority voted for independence, but participation was low when most who opposed the secession boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when police tried to stop the vote at polling stations in the region.
Independence groups camped during the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place anyway, but was forced to take another route.
The electrician Narcis Termes, 68, took part in the separatist protest with his wife and said he no longer believes that Catalonia will become independent.
“Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy about being able to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite a decisive but marginal gain in regional elections in December, Catalan parties that are for independence have had difficulty keeping the momentum up this year, as many of their most well-known leaders live in self-imposed exile or are in jail awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on her mobile, said the conflict had been sparked by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been in custody since the end of last year, announced that he will run for the European Parliament next year.
“Candidating to the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the return of democratic values and the subjugation we have experienced from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men Arrested After Car Drives Into House
Three men – 33, 34 and 39 – have been arrested after a car was driven into a house in Londonderry repeatedly.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent, around 7:30 a.m. BST on Thursday.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
An armrest may also have been fired at the car.
Menga gives Livingston 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win
Livingston shocked the Rangers and sentenced Steven Gerrard to his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga’s strike turned out to be the difference when Gary Holt’s side was split second with Hibernian.
Gerrard's side still hasn't won a Premiership away this season and meets Hearts, with eight more points, next Sunday.
The Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna to the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston extends his winning streak to six games – head coach Holt has still not experienced a loss since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against two-way visitors
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before they scored goals; their straightforwardness gave Rangers all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his performance across the finish line, and then Alan Lithgow could only shoot wide after sliding in to measure Craig Halkett's nicking across the finish line.
The home team was happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could attack in certain games.
And that is how the decisive goal was made.
The Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborated to give Menga a chance, which scored goals from the middle of the finish line.
At that point, the Rangers had dominated the ball, but the home team's defense was impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was left largely in peace.
The same pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow shot wide from another of Livingston's determined games.
Crossings constantly entered Livingston’s target area and were handled without any problems. Two penalty requirements – following Halkett’s challenge by exchanger Glenn Middleton and one by hand – were dismissed.
"Fenomenal" from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotlands Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal display and results for Livingston.
Each one was outstanding and continues to exceed expectations on the way up.
Their playing style and staff have barely changed since they returned to the upper level, but Holt deserves the honor of galvanizing the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding and led a skillfully organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on full span straight through.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They've had their moments under Gerrard, but they didn't live up to the standard.
Their last ball didn’t keep pace – they only opened the home side once – and it’s something of an alarm clock for the Rangers, located in the middle.
Erdogan receives a mixed welcome in Cologne
Saturday offered a smile and blue skies (29 September) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany had breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany – which will repair the relationship between the NATO allies.
They have become inconsistencies over human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the world’s largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police claimed that they prevented 25,000 spectators from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of them Kurdish – also voiced their voices and condemned both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him to Germany.
The dueling protests show the split opinions of a visitor who is considered a hero by some German Turks and is condemned as a single-violence ruler by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in crash by car
A cyclist has died in a crash with a car in London.
The squat took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a well-maintained road in Deptford, south-east London, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped the car and the health care provider was called there, but the man died on the spot.
The crash takes place a few months after another cyclist died in an infection accident on Childers Street, around 1.5 km from the crash on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said they are trying to identify the man and notify his immediate relatives.
Roads have been blocked off and buses have been rerouted and drivers are asked to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Sex Guards Injured in Tumult
Six prison guards have been injured in riots at a high-security prison for men, according to the Prison Office.
The riots broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Specialized "tornado guards" have been called there to deal with the unrest, involving eight prisoners on a grand piano.
The guards were treated in place for minor damage to the face.
A prison service spokesperson said: “Specially trained prison staff have been sent there to deal with the ongoing incident on HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and are clear that those behind this will be referred to the police and may be given extended prison sentences."
HMP Long Lartin holds over 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was being treated in hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, riot police were called to prison to deal with serious riots in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (areas with drought may benefit)
Tropical low pressures are rare to reach Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s likely to happen at the beginning of next week as Hurricane Rosa’s remaining energy advances across the desert in the southwestern United States, at the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings for sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel directly across Phoenix on Tuesday, bringing rain late on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or low pressure status within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 65 km of the Arizona border.
The National Hurricane Center’s latest models predict 5-10 cm of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other parts of the desert in the southwestern United States, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to get 2.5–5 cm of rain with a risk of up to 10 cm.
In areas without the risk of sudden flooding, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Floods are very serious, but part of the rain will probably be useful as the southwestern United States suffers from drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, weather.com reported.
Hurricane Rosa will first travel across the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still with hurricane power on Sunday morning with maximum wind power of 135 km/h, is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and travels north for 20 km/h.
The storm hits cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, calming it down.
It is therefore expected to reach Mexico’s landmass as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Parts of Mexico can get heavy rain, which poses a significant risk of flooding.
"A total of 7.5–15 cm of rain is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a risk of up to 25 cm," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical storm and reach Arizona’s border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then travel through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
“The greatest danger from Rosa and its remaining energy is very heavy rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the desert in the southwestern United States,” the National Hurricane Center said.
The rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden flooding and mud flows in the desert, as well as landslides in mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital and the situation is reported to be "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, police said in Avon and Somerset.
The police are asking anyone who may have filmed what happened to their mobile phone to appear.
Trump Says Kavanaugh 'Leaded, Badness, Anger' From Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the democratic party’s ruthlessness and scandalous tactics,” Trump told his supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “suffered by the badness, the anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that he sexually assaulted her several decades earlier when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified before Congress about his accusation.
The president said on Saturday that “the American people saw the brilliant and the quality and the courage” of Kavanaugh that day.
“A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most skilled legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a first-class history of serving the public,” he told his supporters in the West Virginia audience.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh’s nomination when he talked about the importance of Republicans voting in the upcoming midterm elections.
“We are five weeks from one of the most important choices of our lives.
“I don’t run, but I run,” he said.
"That's why I go around and fight for great candidates."
Trump claimed that Democrats are trying to "stand up and prevent".
The first decisive vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to information to CNN from an assistant to a senior Republican leader.
Hundreds of dead in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, number of rises
At least 384 people died, many were swept away when giant waves crashed on the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when up to six meters high waves crashed against the beach in the dusk and swept out many to a safe death and destroyed everything in their way.
The tsunami came after an earthquake of 7.5.
“When the tsunami warning arrived yesterday, people stopped at the beach instead of running away immediately, and they fell victim to the tsunami,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster agency BNPB, at a meeting in Jakarta.
"Tsunamine was not alone but carried cars, logs and houses with it. It hit everything in its path," Nugroho said. He also said that tsunami had been traveling on the open sea for up to 800 km/h before the affected coastline.
Some climbed into trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 facilities in Palu.
Aerial photos released by the disaster agency show that many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges are distorted and have collapsed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
Aftershocks still hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia’s agency for the evaluation and application of technology BPPT said in a statement that the amount of energy released in the huge earthquake last Friday was 200 times that of the atomic bomb released on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, which may have made the tsunami bigger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the devastation as "extensive" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
Dead victims were found during the crash of collapsed buildings, he said, and 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the victims and injuries could be even worse along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
The communication from Donggala "was completely paralyzed without any information," Nugroho said.
“There are over 300,000 people living there,” said the Red Cross in a statement, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,” they said.
The agency was criticized on Saturday for not informing that the tsunami had struck Palu, but authorities said the waves had surfaced within the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man upstairs in a building is heard screaming frenetic warnings about tsunami to people on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water crashes to the beach and sweeps away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunami led to an extensive power outage that interrupted all communications around Palu, which made the rescue work more difficult for the authorities.
The military has started sending cargo flights from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, but evacuated people are still in great need of food and other supplies.
The city’s airport has been opened for assistance and remains closed to other traffic until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit facilities in Palu on Sunday.
The number of people killed in a tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
World Vision employees in Donggala have made their way to Palu where they seek shelter under tarpaulins on the farm outside the office, but they saw devastation along the way, according to Mr. Doseba.
"They said they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Aid groups have begun the bitter aid work, but some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, supplies and employees from abroad may only be used if a state of emergency is declared after a disaster.
This has not yet happened.
“It’s still a regional disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the authorities say it is a national disaster, we can let in international aid, but that status has not yet been announced.”
When the second night fell in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, relatives and friends of missing people were still hoping that their loved ones would turn out to be the miracles that light up gloomy natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a sewer.
On Sunday, the rescue workers rescued a woman who had been stuck in a hurry for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, Indonesia’s national screen flight team coach, had trained two of the missing screen flyers ahead of the Asian Games, which ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others who were stuck at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Monday, were his students.
“As a screen-flight veteran, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon told us that the hours after the screen flyers heard that Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who attended the beach festival.
But his messages only got a gray check, instead of two blue ones.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves take $26,750 under ATM refill at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who filled a ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport police press release.
The car's driver had emptied a ATM in the entertainment facility and would deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was busy, "another man jumped up behind the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspected escapees from the scene, according to the press release, but the police did not indicate how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information on the identity of the perpetrators should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The Rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
He announced the change of name on Twitter on Saturday and said, "The thing that is formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been called Ye for a long time and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change comes before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande in the program, who set off for "emotional reasons" according to the program's creator.
Ye is an abbreviation of West's current professional name, but he has also said that the word has a religious significance to him.
"I think 'ye' is the word most used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year when he talked about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means 'the only one', to just Ye – a mirror of our good, our evil, our confused, everything.
The album is like a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of a number of famous rappers who have changed names.
Sean Combs has previously been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously collaborated with West, has previously written his name with and without hyphens and capitals.
Mexico’s AMLO vows not to use the military against civilians
Mexico’s newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use the military against civilians now that the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
Troops fired weapons against a peaceful demonstration at the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 600 people during an era when left-wing student movements took root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans with monthly grants to students and by opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double AI funding
Now that China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on field research, according to inventor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment comes after several parts of the U.S. government have made statements about AI, despite the U.S. not having a comprehensive formal AI strategy.
China unveiled its plan last year with the goal of becoming a leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“It would be a good start to double the budget for AI research, given that all other countries are so far behind the US and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
A double budget could double the chance of the next major AI breakthrough being made in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview earlier this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published earlier this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies – Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that beat the top-ranked American Othello player, and later sat in charge of Microsoft Research and was CEO of Google's China department.
Lee previously mentioned technology competitions from the U.S. government, such as the Robot Challenge from the Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked what the next thing would be to be able to identify future visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get funding from the government, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes the academic leaders away from us, but the companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired leading personalities from universities to work on AI.
Lee said new immigration policies could also help the U.S. with AI innovation.
“I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhD students within AI,” he said.
The State Council of China issued its development plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
In China, the National Natural Science Foundation provides grants to individuals at academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations are distributing money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And earlier this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative they call AI Next.
NSF currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
U.S. legislation that would create a National Security Commission if artificial intelligence has made no progress in several months.
Macedonia referendum on change of name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether the country's name should be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia", which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has prevented the country's attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia, claiming that the name of its northern neighbour is a requirement on its territory and has therefore prevented Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the name change would undermine the identity of Macedonia’s Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has led to doubts as to whether the minimum participation of 50% required for the referendum to be considered valid will be reached.
The question on the ballot in the referendum is: "Are you for membership of NATO and the EU with the approval of the agreement with Greece?"
But the supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is worth renaming if Macedonia, one of the countries formed when Yugoslavia split, can join the EU and NATO.
"I am here to vote for the future of our country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
The referendum is not binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said that they intend to follow the outcome in order for it to be considered decisive.
The change of name requires a majority of two-thirds of Parliament.
According to the State Electoral Commission, no irregularities had been reported at 13.
However, participation was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I vote for my children, we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko vote in the referendum in Macedonia on the country's name change, which would open the way for membership of NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Outside the Parliament of Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, arranged a small stage and place out chairs in front of the tents that have been set up by those boycotting the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to go with our heads in the air, not sneak in through the back door,” Kavardarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership would lead to much-needed investments in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20%.
“I think the absolute majority will vote yes, because over 80% of our citizens are for the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
He said that a “yes” result would be a “confirmation of our future”.
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters thought they would vote in the referendum, which falls below the minimum participation required.
According to another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57 percent of the participants thought they would vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them voted yes.
In order for the referendum to be counted, 50 percent of registered voters plus one vote must be counted.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious setback for the Western-oriented government’s policy since it took over in May last year.
Look at: Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero takes his way through Brighton’s defense to score goals
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton's proposal in Manchester City's 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass from the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between Brighton's three defenders and set out on the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He made his way around a defender and ran from several others at the edge of Brighton's finish area.
Then he pushed a pass to Sterling to the left.
The English forward used his first kick in the finish area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
“Aguero has a problem with his feet,” City’s manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing for 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that moment.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial takeover in the Premier League game.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep inside Brighton's territory on that game.
He sent a nice kick along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of kicks and led Sterling to the far pole.
Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net the moment before it ended up out of reach.
City will face Hoffenheim in the group game of the Champions League at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany at 12:55 on Tuesday.
Scherzer wants to play against Rockies
The Nationals have been eliminated from the playoffs, so there was no reason to force one to start.
But competitive Scherzer wants to throw on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, which is a game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, still have a chance for the playoffs.
Rockies got a wild card slot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking for their first division title.
“We’re not playing for anything, but we can get a chance to rub the rubber knowing the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and that the second team would play at a higher level than any other team I would face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to be there?”
The Nationals have not announced their start for Sunday yet, but according to reports, they are leaning towards letting Scherzer throw under the circumstances.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, warmed up in the bullpen on Thursday and would throw on his normal rest Sunday.
Washington's right-handed pitcher is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 200 2/3 innings this season.
Trump Speaks in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court, when he talked about the importance of Republicans voting in the upcoming midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the big, big ... I'm not running, but I'm running. That's why I go around and fight for sovereign candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see a terrible, terrible group of radical Democrats, you see it happening here and now.
They are determined to take back power whatever it takes, you see their evil, horrible.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to run over to take over power and control. That's what they want, power and control. We're not going to let them get it."
Democrats, he said, are fighting to “stand up and prevent.”
“You’ve seen that in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “arga and nasty and horrible and fake.”
He mentioned Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was met by a loud bow from the spectators.
"Do you remember what she said?
“Did you read the document?”
'Eh, eh, huh?
No, no, no, I'm expecting a...' It was really bad body language, some of the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
They do not tolerate people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the latest in a series of MPs from Labour who are told that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My colleague in Parliament Joan Ryan was treated in a similar way when she stood up to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on the security of the nation, on Europe – ironically similar topics to which Jeremy criticized former leaders.
The announcement of the meeting with Nottingham East Labour on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be welcoming and productive".
For most of my eight years as Labour’s local MP, the GC meetings on Fridays have been just that.
But now, unfortunately, many meetings are not, and the promise of "more friendly, gentler" policies has been forgotten long ago, if it ever even began.
It has become increasingly obvious that dissenting opinions are not tolerated within the Labour Party, and every opinion is judged on the basis of whether the party’s leaders accept it.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues I previously thought had a similar political view that I expected to make a complete turnaround and take positions that I would otherwise never have held – whether it was the security of the nation or the EU’s internal market.
Every time I speak in public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – I follow a tirade of ignorance on social media that requires me to be deposed, criticises central politics and says that I shouldn’t even be in Labour.
And this doesn't just happen to me.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments made against me are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of these colleagues when faced with a stream of sexist and racist insults every day but never give up.
One of the biggest disappointments with this era's policy is the level of insults now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that Labour should promote a culture of tolerance.
But in reality, we are no longer this broad church, and with every distrust and change in the rules of selection, the party is becoming ever tighter.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years about flying under the radar and not being too straight, so "it's all right".
But that’s not why I became a politician.
Ever since I joined Labour as a schoolgirl 32 years ago, provoked by Thatcher’s government neglect that literally caused my elementary school classroom to collapse, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most – both at local level and as government minister.
I have never hidden my political views, and that includes the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can in any way have been confused by my views on policies and topics where I do not agree with the current leadership.
To those of you who promoted the claim on Friday, I just want to say that when the country goes towards a Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and public services, I don’t understand why anyone would want to waste time and energy on my loyalty to Labour’s party leaders.
But my main message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituency – both Labour members and others: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats to depose me or political convenience will prevent me from doing what I believe is best for you all.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Oslagna Ayr on top
Two attempts at the last minute may have distorted the result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this delightfully entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
They are now at the top, the only unbeaten side of the ten.
Ultimately, it was their superior defense, as well as their ability to take chances, that gave the home team the win, and coach Peter Murchie has every right to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested during our matches so far and are still unbeaten, so we’re obviously happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Ayr deserves it, they took better chances than us."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute attempt, converted by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead but a yellow card for Scotland's captain Rory Hughes, who was released by the Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to speak the numbers and Jason Baggot made an unconverted attempt.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty, and at the end of the first half he scored and converted a solo attempt to give Ayr a lead of 17-5 during the break.
But Melrose got a good start in the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
It was then a long wait for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, carried by the plan, and after the restart, Ayr increased the lead again with an attempt by Stafford McDowall, which was converted by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair MacPherson then got a yellow card, and Melrose again forced the extra man to pay with an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of hefty pressure.
But the home team recovered and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for tackling Climo without the ball, McPherson made a touch down from the penalty line-out behind Ayr's mouth.
Climo converted, which he did again almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent off flanker Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth attempt.
Still Game star seems ready for new career in restaurant business
Still Game star Ford Kiernan seems ready to enter the restaurant business after it was discovered that he has been named CEO of a licensed restaurant business.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular series, which he writes and plays in together with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the series' last, and Kiernan seems to be planning ahead of Craiglang's life.
According to official records, he is CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, but a source at Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to enter Glasgow's "flowering restaurant industry".
"The sea belongs to us": Coastless Bolivia hopes that the court opens the way to the Pacific again
Seamen patrol a rigged headquarters for the Navy in La Paz.
Public buildings have a blue flag.
The fleet’s bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon bear the motto: “The sea belongs to us.
It is our duty to recover it.”
In coastless Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still strong – and it is also the desire to sail again on the Pacific Ocean.
This hope is higher than in decades now when Bolivia is awaiting a decision from the International Court of Justice on the first of October, after five years of deliberation.
“Bolivia has the drive, a mood of unity and peace, and clearly awaits the result with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will judge in favor of Bolivia's demands that Chile, after years of irregular discussions, must negotiate with Bolivia to allow them a separate outlet to the sea.
Monday’s decision is also of great importance to Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president who is facing a controversial re-election campaign next year.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe it is incredible that the court judges in favor of Bolivia, and that not much would change even if it does.
The United Nations Court of Justice, based in the Netherlands, does not have the right to award Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision was announced just six months after the final arguments suggests that the case was "not complicated," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the last four years may have hurt rather than promoted Bolivia’s chances.
"The question of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
She claims that Morale’s aggressive rhetoric has tarnished Chile’s remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue the discussion, but it will be extremely difficult to do so after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, did not consider that the court’s decision had been taken unusually quickly.
Monday will give Bolivia "an outstanding opportunity to embark on a new era for its relationship with Chile" and a chance to "put an end to 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the issue of the sea as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific,” he said.
“The decision is a chance to realize that we have to move on from the past.”
North Korea Says Nuclear Disarmament Requires Trust in the U.S.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says the nation will not denuclearize its nuclear weapons until they can’t trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the two rival leaders.
His comments came when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of resolving the impasse of nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a “desirable dream” to continue sanctions and U.S. protests against a statement that ending the Korean War will ever tame North Korea.
Washington hesitates to agree to the statement without Pyongyang first launching significant nuclear disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang really intends to get rid of a weapons arsenal that the country probably sees as its only chance to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris Fashion Shows Reveal Latest Line Huge Headwear On The Way To Shops Near You
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely block the sun, we have the right thing for you.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a range of crunchy, oversized headwear for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which dazzled the style icons at Paris Fashion Week.
Incredibly impractical hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and the designers have sent off their eye-catching creations on the catwalk.
Valentino's main creation was an overly beige hat with a feather-like wide hatboard that completely took over the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jewel-encrusted watermelons, a magician’s hat, and even a pineapple – but they’re not meant to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn up lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
One creation resembled a wetsuit with a snorkel and a diving mask, and another looked like a molten glass strut.
And if you continue the enormous courage, you are lucky.
Fashion experts predict that the huge hoods may be on their way to stores near you.
The oversized hats come shortly after La Bomba – the straw hat with a 60 cm roast that has been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the incredibly impractical hat that has taken over social media sent out yet another great creation on the catwalk – a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the model in swimsuit that held it.
The terracotta bag, with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, excelled in the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the stores next summer – the designer has had such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills crucial for global citizens
Scotland’s independent schools maintain outstanding academic results and this continued in 2018 with yet another set of outstanding test results, which are only strengthened by individual and collective advances in sports, art, music and other community engagements.
With up to 30,000 students in Scotland, the schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service for their students and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further education, their chosen careers and their role as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement customized curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and in demand subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it goes to his heart.”
It’s a powerful reminder that we can’t just rely on English when we create relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s test results show that language is at the top of the list, with the highest number of approved results in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received A in the final test Higher Grade.
Data collected from SCIS 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of students who studied Mandarin received an A in Higher Grade, and 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French, and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as crucial skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language as a subject choice is now considered as important as science, technology, engineering and mathematics on curricula in independent schools and beyond.
A 2014 survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that employers for various reasons had difficulty filling their vacancies, with 17 percent attributed to a lack of language skills.
With that said, language skills become all the more necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more future jobs requiring language skills, these skills become necessary in a globalized world.
Regardless of their career choice, they will have a real advantage in the future if they have adopted a second language.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a survey of more than 4,000 adult Britons published by YouGov in 2013, 75 percent responded that they could not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation in it, and where French was the only language that totaled a two-digit percentage (15 percent).
Therefore, it is so important to invest in language teaching for our children.
Being able to speak multiple languages, especially those used in developing countries, gives your child a better chance of finding meaningful employment in the future.
In Scotland, each school will teach different combinations of languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important for the UK by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from within independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools strive to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and get them with the skills necessary to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
In a global economic environment, it is undoubtedly language that continues to be crucial for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland’s youth.
I'll faut bien le faire.
John Edward is Head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans looking forward to seeing LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday’s first season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he plays has not yet been decided.
“There will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on Laker’s official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' preseason schedule.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to get ready,” he said.
Trump's West Virginia campaign event, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is making his first campaign event tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s Trump’s first of five scheduled appearances next week, including events at places he has great support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Waiting for a confirmatory vote of his candidate to the Supreme Court's vacant post, Trump aims to build support for upcoming mid-term elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress ahead of the upcoming November election.
What time is Trump’s West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s Wheeling, West Virginia campaign event is scheduled for 19:00, tonight Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s West Virginia rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week’s interrogation of the candidate to Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who was tense after accusations of his sexual assault, with an expected delay in the Senate vote of up to a week while the FBI’s investigation into the case is ongoing.
But the primary purpose of these events is to help Republicans get some meat on their feet before the November election.
Thus, President Trump said that these five gatherings next week aim to “engage volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the hectic campaign period,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
The night’s events, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can draw fans from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract attention from Pittsburgh’s media,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has fallen behind in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to get there to try to give him an increase in opinion polls,” said Simon Haeder, a West Virginia University state scientist.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA fights to keep hopes alive before Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, the Saturday afternoon couples could have been what was required for this Ryder Cup.
The swinging pendulum of the moment is a completely invented sport concept, but something that players really believe in, and more than ever before, in the face of competitions like these.
So what momentum is this about now?
“They had a six-point lead and now it’s four, so we’re wearing it as a small momentum I guess,” said Jordan Spieth when he finished the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of four-point advance with twelve more to win.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they have some wind in the sails, but they have a lot to be encouraged by, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and combed home three points out of four each.
Spieth has been sharp from tee to green and precedes with good example.
The winning streak scaled even higher as his round continued and he lowered a crucial putt to take the game four all-square when he and Thomas had been behind with two after two games.
His putt who won them the match of 15 was met with a similar bet, with the conviction that the American team is not yet out of the game.
“You really have to dig deep and worry about your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all these players have left now.
18 holes to victory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cup's undisputed story.
Europe’s odd but adorable couple are four out of four and now nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't do a bogey on Saturday afternoon and they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
These achievements and audience reactions state that they are the players to beat on Sunday and there is no more popular player who could comb home a potential European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both, at the same time on different holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made the process short with Sergio Garcia, tomorrow's four-ball hero, along with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine lowered the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they never even came close to crawling out of.
On Sunday, however, there is no one to help you out of the hole.
Fireball and foursome are so fascinating to look closely at because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give and how a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and taken a significant lead for the last day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has a fighting spirit that some, especially on the US side, had doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 in the Ryder Cup last day
Europe will have a strong advantage on the Ryder Cup’s final day after coming out of Saturday’s four-ball and foursomes matched with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories over a besieged Tiger Woods and came home four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, which fought to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that never really got started during the morning four-ball with 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursome and won two games, but that was not enough for victory.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 single matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, named "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend is just the second pair to win four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in four-ball, they beat an exhausted Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5 & 4.
Woods, who broke through two games on Saturday, showed some moments of brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-ball and foursome, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested during the morning fireball and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes for a 2 & 1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and third in the world.
Europe did not have wind all the way, but it was a nice, windy day just southwest of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They came home victorious with 2 & 1 over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four-ball and later returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursome after losing the two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point underscore in the single matches, however, Furyk’s side only need a draw to keep the trophy.
After being second best for two days, it looks like a counterattack on Sunday can be difficult to get through.
North Korea says it will “never” disarm unilaterally without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that further sanctions deepened their distrust of the United States and it was not possible for the country to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization’s annual General Assembly that over the past year North Korea had taken “significant measures to show its goodwill,” for example, by stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test installations, and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons technology.
“However, we do not see a similar response from the United States,” he said.
“Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no chance of us unilaterally disarming ourselves first.”
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to an approach divided into stages for the nuclear power that would lead to North Korea being rewarded as it took gradual steps, his statement seemed significant, as it did not reject a unilateral nuclear solution as Pyongyang had done before.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim promised to work towards "decommissioning nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first dismantle its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also declined negotiations to ease harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on “decommissioning first” and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its purpose through coercion and even object to “the declaration of ending the war,” Ri says.
“The notion that sanctions can get us on our knees is a dream come true for those people who lack knowledge about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that U.S. leaders highlighted at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korea’s leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the party to this issue of nuclear disarmament was South Korea and not the United States, the Korean Peninsula nuclear disarmament would not have come to such a deadlock.”
Yet the tone of Ri’s speech was dramatically different than last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea’s future ability to reach the U.S. mainland with rockets was inevitable after “Mr Evil President” Trump called Kim a “rocketman” on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take action on disarmament, but it said that much work still remains and that sanctions must remain until North Korea is disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this and said that “if it takes two years, three years or five months,” it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, however, told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that "the maintenance of the Security Council's sanctions must continue with force and without failure until we realize a complete, final, verified disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to suffocate the funding of Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile program.
Pompeo met with Ri at the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, but North Korea accused him a few hours later of setting "gangster-like demands".
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear-powered complex if the U.S. took "corresponding measures".
He said Kim had told him that the “opposite measures” he was seeking were security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore and moving towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses on getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has prompted all doctoral students to improve their sleep habits in an effort to combat the growing macho culture of studying through caffeine-filled “dykes.”
An academic study found that students at the world’s leading universities are often clueless when it comes to the very foundations of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he considers to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact sleep deprivation had on learning.
“At the end of the day, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why can’t I know this until now, in my last year?’
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep — which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was organized for the first time this year, explains to students the importance of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improving their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The hour-long course includes a range of interactive tasks.
In part of the course there is a picture of a student room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, coaches and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another part, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know it won’t change students’ behavior directly.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as one has the right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes,” added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in the "dying" still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Ensuring that you have enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student’s “secret weapon” to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said – even to avoid weight gain because insomnia puts the brain in starvation mode and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course and has read one of his courses last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course was an eye-opener and inspired him to campaign for a campus-wide course.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study program before they start their studies at the high-performing institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when to lie down and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can cause you to turn on the clock, leading to insomnia problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal lowers Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another loss today when Dolly Menga's strike sent Steven Gerrard's uneventful side to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibrox side was looking to take home their first win on the road since February's 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team delivered Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his team eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership leader Harts.
Menga hit seven minutes before half-time and the Rangers never evened out the result.
While Rangers now fall down to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and is just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there may be more problems on the ledge for Rangers after lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was thrown from the far end.
Gerrard made eight changes to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livi 11 who took a point off Hearts last week and he would have been happy about the way his benevolent game outstripped opponents every time.
Rangers must have dominated, but Livingston did more with the ball control they had.
It should have been a goal already two minutes into the game when Menga's first pass dropped through Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his big chance and shot outside.
A deep free kick from Keaghan Jacobs then reached team captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only reached the rear pole.
The Rangers took control of the game, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game during the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelo certainly felt that he should have had punishment when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson waved away the Colombian's call.
Rangers only managed to score two goals in the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily accepted Lassana Coulibaly's nick and a tam kick from Oviedo Ejaria.
Live opening shots in the 34th minute may go against the spirit of the game, but no one can deny that their master deserved it.
Again, the Rangers failed to deal with Jacob's permanent situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher was fitting for Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted at the break when he traded Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the exchange gave almost immediate effect when the outside hit the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran off his line to block the attempt.
But Livingston continued to get the opponents to play exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping up the long pass after long pass.
Holt's side could have strengthened his lead in the final stage, but McGregor managed to prevent Jacobs before Lithgow nodded outside after the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another late penalty claim when he was tamped with Jacobs, but Thomson again looked away.
Almanac: The inventor of Geiger Counter
And now a page from Sunday's Almanac: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the manic called Geigermeter.
Geiger meters have become a cornerstone of science since then and also feature in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring in the seemingly unlikely cowpoke scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
“What in the world is that?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger meter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals.
Evans: "Yes, it pops now!"
"His" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory
They can then "see" a protein that is common to many cancers and then reinjected
A trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer, saw her ovarian cancer cells disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein that is common to many cancers called HER2, and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers, Prof Berzofsky explained.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West supported Trump by wearing a MAGA cap, following his SNL appearance.
It didn't go so well
Kanye West was ousted from the studio during Saturday Night Live after a swanky appearance praising U.S. President Donald Trump and saying he himself would run for the post in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town where he wore a Make America Great cap, he rallied against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
“So many times when I talk to a white person, they say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s racist?’
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the play of West's exposition was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to run with West with the post.
West had also complained to the audience that he had been harassed backstage for his headgear.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that cap on."
They bullied me!
And then they say I fell low,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you also want to sink low?" and said he would "put my supermancape on, because that means you can't say what I'm allowed to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love.”
His comments attracted more burop at least twice from the audience and employees from SNL seemed embarrassed, Variety reported. One person said, "It became the deadth in the studio."
West had come in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West baffled many with his performance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR STANDING AT YOUR MOB."
But the talk show host, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West simply "was himself and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") that I think embraces and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
We do, she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he was now "the creature formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper’s colleague, Snoop Dogg, has called himself Snoop Lion and, of course, the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
They're trying to murder a knife cut in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man is stabbed at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear at Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington beats toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-winging role as Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has spoken out negatively about the stereotype of the macho hero and says that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel they have to be tough to be respected.
In a statement to Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes "something has gone wrong" and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his co-star in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, even she 31, admitted that he feels "quite strong" to deal with the problem.
"I personally feel quite strong, right now - where have we gone wrong with masculinity?" he said.
“How have we raised men with regard to the problems we see now?”
Kit believes that TV may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued, “What is innate and what is learned?
What is taught on TV and on the streets, which makes young boys feel they have to be in a certain way to be a man?
I think it really is one of the big questions of our time - how do we change that?
It is clear that something has gone wrong for young men.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make any Game of Thrones sequels when the series comes to an end next summer and says he is "ready with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will play in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks the encounter with his wife Rose was the best experience from Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife thanks to the series, so it gave me my future family and my future life,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, whom Kit's character Jon Snow falls in love with, in the Emmys-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family owned in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14% in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, health authorities say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted via sex and marked a change from previous years.
Traditionally, HIV is rapidly spread through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people from year to year.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is an urgent issue in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be widespread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men sooner or later will marry women.
Many of the cases of infection are due to insufficient protection in sexual intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies staff leaking the GOP senator's data, blaming "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters on Saturday condemned allegations that one of her employees had posted personal data on three Republican U.S. senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that these claims were spread by right-wing extremist websites.
"Lies, lies, and more reprehensible lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The released information reportedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information emerged online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on the allegations of sexual assault against the nominated candidate of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Water’s office and released the information about a Water’s staff member, Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
“My staff – whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims – were in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie.”
Water’s statement quickly received criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
They must not be defiant.
They must not question the motives of the questioner.
They have to be calm and calm.”
Fleischer seemed to try to compare Water’s reaction to the Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of appearing angry during Thursday’s interrogation.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who ran to depose Waters in the middle of the term of office, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had warned “appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities of these fraudulent claims.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators will be revealed,” she continued, “and that they will be held legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees.”
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again - Powerless Spy Parody by Rowan Atkinson
It is now tradition to look for Brexit benefits in every new film with a British slope, and the same seems to apply to this re-recording of the latest Johnny English action comedy – a series of spy parodies that kicked off in 2003 with Johnny English and got a new life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sharp satire on how obviously bad we are to become the nation’s new export commodity?
In any case, it has the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face got its license to shop for sake renewed for the second time - his name signals more than anything else that he is a broad comic creation intended for bio-public even in non-English-speaking countries
He is, of course, the clumsy secret agent, who, despite his bizarre claims to smoothieglamour, has received a small piece of Clouseau, a rubbing Mr Bean and a measure of the guy from the opening ceremony to the 2012 London Olympics.
He is also originally based on the traveler and international mysterious man that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV ads that create chaos wherever he goes.
There are one or two great moments in the latest JE movie.
I loved when Johnny English approaches a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and when the rotor blades briefly hit his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy appears, but the humor feels rather low-key and strangely superfluous, especially since the “serious” movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it’s adapted for kids instead of adults and for me Johnny English’s weird upbringing isn’t as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s silent film boss in the role of Bean.
The constantly topical topic is now that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain’s super-secret web network of spies, revealing the identities of all of Britain’s agents out in the field, to the agent in the service’s great discontent – an incredibly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It will be the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and hard-working figure, who already suffers from a complete collapse of his political popularity: Emma Thompson does his best with this quasi-Teresa-May character but the script doesn’t offer much to work with.
Her intelligence adviser informs her that when every single active spy is busy, she must use someone who has retired.
And that means the stuttering Johnny English in his own high person, now employed as a teacher in some wealthy institution, but offering unofficial lessons in the art of working undercover alongside.
English was sent back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former long-lived sidekick Bough, once again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine captain, a jolly-hockey-sticks-role where Vicki Pepperdine is close to being thrown away.
So Batman and Robin are back after everything went so terribly wrong on Her Majesty's Secret Service and encounter Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister will fall hard for the charismatic tech billionaire, who claims he can solve Britain’s computer trouble: the unfortunate Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of farsighted parades: dressed as waiters, they set fire to a flashy French restaurant; they create chaos when they smuggle themselves aboard Volta’s luxury boat; and English triggers sheer anarchy as he tries to use a VR headset to get acquainted with the inside of Volta’s house.
There is certainly a lot of work behind the latter sequence, but even though the film is both charming and fast-paced, it has an air of children's television around it.
Pretty moderately everything like that.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I can’t help but think: Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour denies drafting a plan for Britons to work a four-day week but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan that involves the UK working a four-day week – but is paid for five.
The party reportedly wants business leaders to hand over savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.
It would see employees enjoying a three-day weekend - but keeping the same pay.
According to sources, the idea would "fit" with the party's economic agenda for the benefit of the workers.
Switching to a four-day week has been approved by Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic change.
A representative higher up in Labor told The Sunday Times: A review of the policy is expected to be made public before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen in a day, but a four-day work week is a quest that fits into the party’s attitude to balance the economy for the benefit of the worker and the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, even the Greens party that promised a four-day work week during its election campaign in 2017.
However, this objective is not endorsed by Labour as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: “A four-day work week is not the party’s policy and it’s not something the party agrees on.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week’s Labour conference to communicate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from “faceless leaders” and “smarter” on state corporations.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies cannot recover their full stake, since a Labour government can make "reductions" because of what they perceive to have been wrongful actions.
He also confirmed plans to put workers in corporate boards and create so-called Inclusive Ownership Funds where 10% of the private company’s equity is handed over to its employees, who then face annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell in the TV program "60 minutes" about whether the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their views
The FBI’s investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising the question of whether the agency’s investigations could prompt some Republican senators to change the position on the issue.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, “60 Minutes” correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said when I went into the hearing, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, that the statement came out, and said, "Have you done that?"
He was determined, convinced, unequivocal.”
Graham's voice, however, seems unwavering.
“I’ve already decided on Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a dynami tank making,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all the names she names couldn't verify it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything new changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features an enormously impressive array of stars performing and an equally impressive mission; to fight world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people heading to Central Parks Great Lawn, not only to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s real goals: to fight extreme poverty by 2030.
According to a 2012 statement, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to fight poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you weren’t ready to pay for a VIP ticket), concert guests would perform a series of tasks, or “measures” such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, calling or otherwise meaningfully helping raise awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been at 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to convince people to act, or is it just about so-called “clicktivism” – people who feel they make a real difference by signing an online application or writing a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters who fought for a variety of goals.
It says that these measures have helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements deriving from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or funded.
The group estimates that the assets collected so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the UK between investors and actors engaged in “helping children develop to their full potential,” promising to give Rwanda $35 million to help combat malnutrition in the area after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can make social injustice as malnutrition is a footnote in history,” said the ambassador for the Tracey Ullman partnership to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 measures were taken requiring the UK to improve the diet for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the project, Power of Nutrition, which includes diet programs targeting 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on his website, “What makes you think we can fight extreme poverty?”
Global citizen responded: “There will be a long and difficult road – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the artists performing at this year’s events in New York, whose hosts are Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use its fleet in a "blocked" to prevent Russian energy exports, Interior Minister says
The government can "if necessary" resort to its fleet to prevent Russian energy actors from entering the markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where it acts on the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern parts of Europe,” he said.
And according to him, there are ways and means to deal with it.
“The United States has the ability to, with our fleet, ensure that the seaways are kept open and, if necessary, apply blocked, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are really the same.
"The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as a "day-long" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
Statements come after the Trump administration’s goal was to increase exports of its liquid natural gas to Europe, to replace Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin the “captain” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to $110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
They argue that Washington’s opposition to the project is driven only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position was backed by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading trade association, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I strongly dislike that a third party disrupts our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a “proper thinker” if she will stand in the 2020 presidential election, Massachusetts Senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would take a “proper contemplation” about her participation in the presidential election following the U.S. midterm elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running as a candidate.
“It’s time for women to get to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the top,” she said.
"After November 6, I'll take a big thinker to run for president."
Warren weighed in on President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting and said he “took this country in the wrong direction.
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been outspoken in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for Supreme Court, Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "we obviously need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a vote released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren’s own supporters did not believe she would run for office in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a survey conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% for a potential candidacy and 48% against.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed for a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palins PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my own son is going through, what he’s going through now when he’s back, I can relate to other families who have experience of PTSD and part of the trauma that our soldiers are returning with,” she told the audience at a meeting of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they come back as other people, they come back hardened, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their colleagues, soldiers and pilots and all other members of the military, have given the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence against a woman, attempting to prevent a report of domestic violence and possession of weapons in intoxicated condition, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, as well as the District of Columbia, support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a judicial review aimed at a new U.S. policy denying asylum to victims fleeing gang-related violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and district filed a friend-of-the-court application on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and his violent gang member sons" abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
The state lawyers who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, countries that produce a large number of asylum seekers, as nations facing major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy amended a 2014 decision by the immigration authorities that allowed illegal immigrants to seek asylum to escape domestic violence.
The District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
“Federal law requires all asylum applications to be assessed based on specific facts and circumstances to which the claim applies, and such a provision is contrary to that principle,” according to the friend-of-the-court report.
Lawyers further argued in the report that policies that deny immigrants’ entry harm the U.S. economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “deliver the necessary labor force.”
Justice Minister Jeff Sessions ordered judges in asylum cases in June to no longer grant asylum to victims who fled domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asyl is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said when the policy was announced on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems – even all the serious problems – that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in search of survivors
For the survivors, the situation looked increasingly gloomy.
"It feels very tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who consoled her cowardly boy in an evacuation center in the city of Palu.
“The ambulance picks up dead bodies all the time.
Clean water is a scarce commodity.”
The inhabitants were seen returning to their ruined homes, rotting through water-damaged possessions, and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, which were damaged in the 7.5 earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from a broken back and shoulder, rested outside Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to continued strong aftershocks.
With tearful eyes, he told me that the violent earthquake shook the room on the hotel’s fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We couldn't escape.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, then it became quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe.”
US ambassador accuses China of “bullying” with “propaganda ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in an American newspaper about the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. Ambassador to China accused China of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily paying a supplement to the Des Moines Register – the state of Iowa’s best-selling newspaper – after accusing China of trying to participate in the U.S. 6th congressional election, something China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters where is a new phase in an escalating campaign from Washington intended to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to use advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war with increased tariffs on each other’s imports.
China’s retaliation tariffs early in the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states like Iowa that support Trump’s Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former long-standing governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had damaged U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a debate article in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now doubling the bullying by posting propaganda ads in our own free press."
“China’s government uses America’s beloved tradition of freedom of expression and a free press to spread propaganda to by publishing paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the newsstand on the street here in Beijing, you will find a limited number of dissenting voices and will not see any true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have about China's troubled economy, because the media is controlled with the iron hand of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers shortlisted the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans scare away female voters for middle-year election through Kavanaugh fiasco, analysts warn
As many top Republicans defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh who faces multiple allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that there will be a setback, especially from women, in the upcoming election.
The sentiments about this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have already shown where they stand in the election.
It’s not possible to turn back the clock,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)'s last attempt at an FBI investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday — they won’t forget it tomorrow and not in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to Washington, D.C..
On Friday morning, the protesters chanted "November is coming!" when they demonstrated in the hall to the Senate building when Republicans controlling the court committee chose to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go on the roof,” Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, told the news site.
“People say it’s already been high, it’s true.
But it could be higher, especially among still indefinite female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who, despite not liking the president, often do not vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony of allegations of sexual assault against the nominated candidate to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a backlash could follow if Republicans pushed through the confirmation.
“This has become a confused mess for the GOP,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about whether the committee’s vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh comes through, it’s also about how Republicans have handled this and how they’ve treated her,” said Guy Cecil, head of Priorities USA, a group that helps democratic election campaigns, for the news channel.
But Americans generally seem to be divided over who to believe in in the wake of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, and the latter seems to be the one they believe in the most.
A new poll by YouGov found that 41% of respondents definitely or likely believed in Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they definitely or likely believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lying during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations that Ford has made, as well as those from at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh violently attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate of the Supreme Court exposed his genitals to her while attending a party during their time as a Yale student in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend’s latest project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "world domination".
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup company.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data store” or a POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser at the same time.
What is unique about personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can access what type of information.
The company calls it “personal authorization through data.”
The idea with Inrupt, according to company CEO John Bruce, is that the company should bring resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, a number of software developers who will work on the project and a group of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where all business models are put on the high ground overnight.
“We don’t ask for permission.”
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created by Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and head of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am very optimistic about this new era on the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Priest Rewarded With Victoria Cross During World War I Celebrated
The only priest in the English Church to be awarded a Victoria Cross during World War I is now celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt Col Reverend Bernard Vann received the award for his actions during the attack on Bellengrise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and was never told that he had been awarded the British military’s most prestigious prize.
A memorial stone was uncovered by his two grandchildren during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather was awarded the prize.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt Col Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "by a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field and machine guns."
He later rushed up to the firing line and led with "great bravery" the line forward before deciding the battle alone.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something that I know I could never live up to, but something I am very humble about."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also put down a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "felt very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "a real hero's courage is demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 and instead got to see Greta Gris
Imagine this, you’ve stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 just to be denied watching the main event.
The show from San Jose featured 13 matches, including six on the main card and was shown live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 06:00, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet each other, the British viewers were surprised when the program suddenly changed to Greta Gris.
Many were not impressed after they had stayed awake until the early morning hours to watch the game.
A fan on Twitter described the program change to a cartoon children's program as "a sick joke".
"It was the government's decision that the content was not appropriate so early in the morning, so they had to switch to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice president of marketing and communications when asked about the broadcast.
"Greta pig, yes"
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said they will work with their scheduling to better include British viewers in the future.
“I think we will be able to find a solution for the re-price,” Coker said.
"But it's six in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, the program change upset a lot of people.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
In fact, it was a state issue.
I can promise it won't happen next time.
We will show five games instead of six - as we normally do. We took water over our heads in our quest to satisfy the fans.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels "Sublime" Due to Sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he felt inferior to his peers during his childhood due to his sexuality – but that also spurred him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize he wasn’t like everyone else until he was in high school.”
Speaking in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he talked about gay rights to give others "jump".
He also said he cared less about winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The popular show's regular host, Kirsty Young, has taken off for a few months due to illness.
During his one-off performance on Laverne’s first program, Daley tells how he felt “less worthy” than others during his upbringing, because “it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls.”
He said, “This sense of feeling less worthy and feeling different has been a real source of the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “someone,” he said, so he didn’t betray everyone when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile advocate for LGBT rights and took advantage of his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to convince more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he took the floor because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without restrictions and wanted to give others "jump".
The three-time world champion said that his fall in love with a man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “came as a surprise.”
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he participated in his first OS at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age with similar life experience.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole life perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was just about winning gold," he said.
“But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My gold medal is Robbie.”
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said Dad did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked was if they got their tickets to the 2012 London Olympics – where he wanted to sit on the first row.
“I couldn’t say to him, ‘You won’t be able to sit on the front row, Dad,’” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally admitted he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew this was what I had dreamed of my whole life - to dive in front of a home crowd in an Olympic arena, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song choice – Proud of Heather Small – a song that had followed him up to the Olympics and that still gave him shakes.
Desert Island Discs will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson out of shape on the bench during Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will hit a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but then he must fix the form to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time in a row, was benched by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the center of events, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time winner spent his day acting like a cheerleader and training his game in the hope of getting a chance to show off his abilities.
He has never been the straightest of drivers, not even at the top of his career and the 48-year-old is not in shape in front of the tough track at Le Golf National, where the long rump often penalties miss hard.
It’s not just the track that frightens, in the ninth game on Sunday, Mickelson meets champion Francesco Molinari, who together with novice Tommy Fleetwood won all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are 4 points below in front of the 12 single games have a win at the start, Mickelson’s match can be crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, not because he could say much else.
“He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a pat on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
"His self-confidence is nothing wrong with it.
He is a celebrity and he has contributed so much to these teams in previous seasons and in the past week.
I probably didn’t think he would be able to play two games.
I thought he'd do more, but now it's what it is and we'll have to settle for it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson passes Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches played.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never fully lived up to the heights of his individual results.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, but Furyk said his presence brought other qualities to the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he likes to joke with people and he’s a good guy to have in the team,” he explained.
“I also think the younger players thought it was fun to play against him this week, which was fun to see.
He adds so much more than just games.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great management can soon be a memory only
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead in last-day singles in the Ryder Cup can quickly change into an unpleasant experience.
Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballestero held a five-point advantage over the Americans but eventually won with the lowest possible margin with the result 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2- 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“It reminds you that we were leading big at Valderrama, we were leading big at Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won with distress and hardly,” Bjorn (on the photo) said after seeing the 2018 class win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday and leading with 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will prove to me and everyone in the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow we will give everything.
Go out and do everything right.
This is not over until we see the point on the board.
Our goal is to try to win this trophy and that’s where our focus is.
I’ve said it all the time, I’m focusing on the 12 players that are on our side, but we’re well aware of what’s waiting on the other side – the best players in the world.”
Björn was pleased with the performance of his players on a tough golf course and added: "I would never be able to do this myself.
There are new challenges tomorrow.
Tomorrow it is the individual achievements that apply and that is a completely different thing.
It’s fun to be out with a partner when things are going well, but when you’re out there on your own, your capacity as a golfer is fully tested.
It is the message that you need to convey to the players, to get out the best of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he also has to go and get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Björn, opponent Jim Furyk will want players to perform better individually than they did as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who came home three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of major conversions during the final days of a competition, both in the winning team in Brookline before he ended up as a loser when Europe drove "Miracle at Medinah".
“I remember every damn word of it,” he said in response when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had gathered his players for the final day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you’d like to go out as fast as Brookline, as you would at Medinah.
When the tempo starts in one direction, there will be a lot of pressure on these intermediate matches.
We did our set-up and placed the guys we wanted to, you know, create some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the fight and meets Rory McIlroy in the top game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter meet the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think it's enough all the way," Bjorn said of his single picks.
Germany's new warships are delayed again
The German Navy's newest frigate would have been launched in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War era, but it will not be launched until at least next year due to faulty systems and high costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the flagship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper citing a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the fleet as early as 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery were fatal to the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the fleet in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen frigates.
They will include a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and naval missiles, as well as some stealth techniques, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to station the newest frigates for up to two years without contact with home ports.
But continuous delays mean that the ground-breaking warships – which allow Germany to project power abroad – are already obsolete when put into operation.
The fatal F125 frigate created headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media reported a number of important "software and hardware failures" that made the warship worthless if used on a combat mission.
Deficiencies in the software were particularly important as ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be driven by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew of older frigates of the Bremen class.
It also found that the ship has a significant excess weight, leading to impaired performance and limiting the Navy's ability to perform future upgrades.
The 7,000 ton heavy "Rhineland-Palatinate" is thought to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from faulty hardware, the entire project price tag – including crew training – also becomes a problem.
It is said to have amounted to EUR 3.1 billion (USD 3.6 billion) of fraud, compared to EUR 2.2 billion in the initial stage.
Problems affecting the newest frigates are particularly important in the light of the latest warnings that Germany's maritime power is reducing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the fleet actually "starts to lack fully equipped ships".
The official said it was a growing problem, as old ships were dismantled but no replacement ships were provided.
He regretted that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust steals attention to the secret life of bats
New research conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their pursuit of food.
We hope that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow South and Dwarf pipistrells as well as brown loan-making and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat sounds and what species do what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed area image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS nature conservation advisor, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forest land for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects bon and loss of habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as aircraft and certain chemical treatments of building materials as well as attacks from house taxes.
In fact, bats are not blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to find insects and obstacles in their airway.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats seriously.
The organization has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct investigations, examine bon and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organization has also established Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal area for them.
“Here at Threatave, we have a good area for bats,” he said.
“We have the old buildings, lots of veteran trees and a variety of favorable habitats.
But there is a lot about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us understand more about what they need to thrive.
He emphasizes the importance of searching for bats before performing maintenance in real estate, since it is possible that accidental destruction of a single nest could kill up to 400 females and young, and possibly wipe out an entire population.
Bats are peaceful and it is illegal to kill, trouble or disturb them or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said, “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don’t know how their populations are feeling.”
Ronaldo rejects rape conviction while his lawyers threaten to sue the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape charges against him “fake news” and says that people “want to promote themselves” by using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal’s and Juventus’ forwards have been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live video on Instagram, Ronaldo (33) dismissed the reports as “fake news” when he spoke to his 142 million followers, just hours after the claims were reported.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today was fake news," said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
“They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be known by using my name, but that's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player said, laughing.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over allegations, which they have called “an inadmissible reporting of suspicions of integrity,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for “moral damage to an amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he reportedly raped her anal, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" betrayed by the "last percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo had confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was with consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photographs of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to a settlement because she felt "fear of retaliation" and was worried about "being humiliated in public".
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to cancel the settlement because she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in an agreement of €100 million.
Brexit: Britain “will forever regret” losing car manufacturers
Britain “would regret it forever” if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "disturbing" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, they would temporarily cease production at the Burnaston factory, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker announced that the effects of border delays in the event of no deal being concluded could result in job losses.
The Burnaston factory - which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
“My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see a halt to production in our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s CEO at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have communicated their concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini facility in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main problem is what car manufacturers say are the risks to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is operated on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars ordered.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it could lead to disruptions at the border that the industry says could lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day’s consumption in stock at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and hence production would be forced to stop.
Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "exactly calibrated to avoid border controls."
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that enables, as I say, not only success at present to be appreciated now, but for us to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“The statements from not only Toyota but other manufacturers are that we absolutely must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term warned that increased costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the Unite union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly worried: "My experience is that these jobs never come back.
A government official said: “We have put forward an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “shot in another week” while the fight against the Brett Kavanaugh nominated to the Supreme Court continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, relations between Trump and Russia and the president’s potential obstruction of justice.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy justice minister, thereby jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, has fueled Washington’s grievances for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing interception equipment to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of deposing the president via the 25th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, and reports that he was about to resign appeared.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York City, to be held on Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to fire Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Legal Committee's interrogation where Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, spoke in Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “A date for it has not been set, it can happen this week, or a delay of one week considering all the other things that happen in the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see, and I always like to keep the press updated.”
Some reporters would dispute that claim: Sanders has not had a press conference from the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to anything objectionable to TV reporters as "playing for the gallery", although she said, "I agree with the fact that they are playing for the gallery."
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
“The president holds several question sessions than any president before him,” she said, adding without citing evidence: “We have looked at these numbers.”
Conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but “if the press gets the chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it’s infinitely better than talking to me.
We are trying to do this often and you have seen us do a lot in recent weeks and it will replace press conferences, and you can then ask questions directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, with spontaneous statements and sometimes bizarre appearances before the assembled reporters.
Health Minister writes to EU employees at NHS Scotland with regard to concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and desire for them to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before Britain withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the cost of decommissioned status applications for EU citizens working in the country’s decentralised public sector.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have continued, ahead of decisions expected to come this fall.
But the British government has also intensified its preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know this must be a very worrying time for all of you.
That is why I want to reiterate how much I value the efforts of every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU, and the rest of the world, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes acute surgery after suffering head injury
Tennessee State Tigers lineback Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's loss by 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennesseans Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the damage occurred just before half-time.
"He came to the sidelines and just collapsed," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before placing him on a stretcher was carried out for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State representative told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was operated at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no data on the type/range of the damage yet" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year redshirt student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, giving him a season total of 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers may pay higher stamp tax when buying property in the UK, and the extra money is used to help the homeless, according to Tory party's new plans
The measure will neutralize Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters
The increase in stamp tax will apply to those who do not pay tax in the UK
The UK Treasury expects to raise <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be allowed to pay a higher stamp tax when buying property in the UK. The extra money will be used to help the homeless, which will be announced by Prime Minister Theresa May today.
The measure will be perceived as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters with promises of housing with more affordable prices and targeting high-income people.
The increase in stamp tax will be taken out by individuals and companies that do not pay tax in the UK. The extra money will give a boost to the government’s efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional fee is in addition to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on holiday homes and homes purchased for rent. It may be up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance believes that the measure will draw in up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13% of the newly built properties in London are bought by people living outside the UK, which drives up prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get a foothold in the housing market.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost cities because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new release comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson requested a reduction in the stamp tax to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping prices up by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to waive quotas on affordable housing prices to resolve Britain’s “terrible housing situation.”
Jeremy Corbyn has launched an eye-catching range of proposals for housing reforms, including rental ceilings and an end to bills without the tenant’s fault.
He also wants to give municipalities more opportunity to build new housing.
Theresa May says: “Last year I said that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream, that life will be better for every new generation.
This means solving the problems in the housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be right when it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK, and also for companies based abroad, to buy housing as too hard-working residents in our country.
The dream of owning a home has become for too many people just a distant dream, and homelessness is still an unworthy fact.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to train Scotland"
Sunderland leader Jack Ross says his “final goal” is to someday become Scotland’s coach.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is looking forward to the challenge of blowing lives at the club from northeast England, which is currently in third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I played a match in the B national team and that’s all,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
"But when I was growing up, I looked a lot at Scotland at Hampden with my dad, and it has always attracted me back.
But that chance can only come if I manage to lead a club.”
Among Ross's representatives as coach for Sunderland are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says he was not worried about succeeding such established names in such a large club. He has previously declined offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Right now I'm assessing success based on the answer to the question 'can I get this club back to the Premier League?'
This club is definitely home to the Premier League, given its structure and talents,” he said.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I’d probably just see myself as successful here if I could get the club back there.”
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after a period as an assistant coach in Dumbarton and a 15-month tenure as a member of Heart's coaching team.
Then he helped Alloa get back from the descent to the third division, lifting St Mirren from being close to the descent to becoming the winner of the championship title the following season.
Ross says he is more satisfied now than ever during his playing career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a road forethought," he recalls, referring to when he took command of Alloa.
“I really thought leadership was quite right for me, in a completely different way than playing.
It sounds strange, because I had okay results and could live decently on it. In addition, I had some great successes.
Playing can be tough.
There is a lot you have to get through every week.
There is still stress and pressure at work for me, but exercising feels just right.
I've always wanted to practice and now I do it. I feel better than I've ever done in my entire adult life."

A survey shows that the perfect time to have a beer is 17:30 on a Saturday
This summer’s heat wave has resulted in increased revenues for the country’s struggling pubs, but the restaurant chains have gained more pressure.
Figures showed that pub and bar groups increased sales by 2.7% in July, but restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin from CGA, which compiled the figures, said: “Continued beautiful weather and the fact that England remained in the World Cup longer than expected meant that we saw a similar pattern in July compared to June, when the pubs went up by 2.8%, but the restaurants had even greater difficulties.
The decline in restaurant turnover by 1.8% in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars offering mainly drinks showed the absolute best results with figures for the same period last year that had gone up more than the restaurants had gone down.
Pubs offering food also had a hard time in the beautiful weather, although it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
People just seem to want to go out and drink something.
The result of managed pubs and bars went up by 6.6% that month, and food sales down by 3%."
Paul Newman, serving and entertainment industry analyst RSM, said: “These results are a continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and major sporting events are still the most important factors when it comes to sales in the big food market.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups still have difficulties, although a 4.8% reduction in sales each year is particularly difficult to manage in addition to ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have become more inconvenient for companies driven by food sales. Time will show if the more moderate temperatures we have had in August give some much-needed respite."
The overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened establishments, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the fact that fewer new brands are now being launched.
Coffer Peach Tracker for the pub and restaurant industry in the UK collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 active groups with a total turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is an established benchmark in the industry.
One in five children have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents
One in five children, sometimes as young as 11 years old, have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 students in high school and high school shows an increase in the number of fake Instagram pages
The result has raised concerns that it is sexual content that is posted there
20% of students said they had a "main account" they showed to their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, create accounts on social media that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students in high school and high school showed a rapid increase in the number of “fake Insta accounts,” a reference to the Instagram image sharing service.
The result has been delayed because it is sexual content that is posted there.
20% of students stated that they have a cleaned "main account" that they can show to their parents, and so they also have private accounts.
A mother who stumbled across her 13-year-old daughter's secret side found a teenager urging others to "rape me."
According to the study, conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
The president of HMC, Mike Buchanan, says: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are attracted to creating places on the internet where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the board of the Scottish Athletics Association, Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as an external board member at the Governing Body’s Annual General Meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most prized athlete, and President Ian Beattie describes the election as an outstanding opportunity for those who lead the sport to take advantage of her broad experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh has gained great respect throughout the Scottish, British and international sports world, and we are confident that Scotland's athletes would benefit greatly from becoming a member of the board," Beattie said.
Doyle says: “I would like to be a voice for the athletes and I hope that I can contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, has a total of four Olympic golds and is now an expert commentator on the BBC. He lost the ability to go after a mini-stroke.
He tweeted: "Today, a month ago, I got a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time was allowed to show if I would recover, and to what extent.
It’s been hard work, but I’ve recovered completely, learned to walk again and now I’m doing mobility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouragement!”
Advertising for breast pumps that compare moms with how share the internet
A company that sells breast pumps has caused disagreements on the internet with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers with cows that are milked.
To draw attention to the launch of what is said to be "the world's first silent portable breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie has released a music video-inspired commercial with humorous app to show the freedom the new pump gives mothers pumping breast milk.
Four real moms dance in a high-pitched barn with cows to a song with lines of text like, "Yes, I milk myself but have no tail" and "If you didn't know it, this isn't a cheerleader, it's tits."
The chorus continues: "Pump out, pump out, I feed the babies, pump out, pump out, I milk the ladies."
But the commercial, which has been published on the company’s Facebook page, has caused controversy on the internet.
The film has received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and has met mixed reactions from the viewers. Many say that it sheds light on the "phases" of the dairy industry.
"A very bad decision to use cows to market this product.
Just like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, but their babies are taken away from them just a few days after birth.”

Another comments: “You understand that it is traumatic for both mother and child.
But, of course, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another one adds: “What reality-absorbed commercials.”
Others defend the film, and a woman admits that she thinks the song is "hysterically funny."
“I think this is brilliant.
I would have gotten one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
“This is a brilliant product,” someone wrote.
Another comments: “This is a fun commercial that caters to moms who pump (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like ‘kiss’.”
This is not a film that pays tribute to or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the film, the women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump stuffed in the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no cables or tubes and can be worn discreetly in a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin is a partner and ECD at Mother, and she says: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between women pumping breast milk and dairy cows, we wanted to shed light on breast pumping and its challenges, while demonstrating in an entertaining and easily recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom the new pump brings.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
During London’s fashion week, a two-child mom appeared on the catwalk wearing clothes by designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp near the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has skyrocketed even though the number of people crossing the border each month remains relatively unchanged. This is partly due to the fact that frantic rhetoric and harsh policies imposed by the Trump administration have made it more difficult to place the children in reference persons.
In the past, most reference persons themselves have been paperless immigrants, and fear putting their own opportunities to stay in the country at risk by declaring themselves willing to receive a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential reference persons and other adult members of the household would have to leave fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to be reference persons for unaccompanied minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70 % of those arrested were not known by law enforcement authorities since earlier.
Nearly 80% of those who are either referents themselves or family members of referents are illegally located in the country, and a large part of them are criminal aliens.
So we continue to persecute these individuals,” said Albence.
In order to deal with children's cases more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within one month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, as was the case in the past, according to staff at the premises.
Many of them are present on video links rather than personally to bring their legal status lawsuit before an immigration judge.
Those who are not considered entitled to protection are deported quickly.
The longer children are detained, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to staff at the shelters and reports that have come from the system in recent months.
Proponents say concern rises at larger facilities such as Tornillo, where signs that a child has it difficult more likely to be ignored, due to the size of the facility.
They add that if children are moved to the tent city without getting enough time to prepare emotionally and say goodbye to friends, the traumas many people are already struggling with can worsen.
Syria demands that US, French and Turkish “occupational forces” withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also vice prime minister, said that the foreign forces are illegally located on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the General Assembly.
Moualem stressed that “the war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said the Damascus government would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we have liberated all Syrian territories" both from terrorist groups and "all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem said that the circumstances are good for them to come home, accusing "certain Western countries" of "spreading irrational fear" that enables refugees to stay away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return,” he said.
“They are politicizing something that should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The US and the EU have warned that there will be no help for reconstruction in Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to move forward with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement disrupted a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian troops against the province, which has three million inhabitants.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had “clear deadlines,” expressing hope that a military intervention would be directed at jihadists, including fighters from the Al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who “will be wiped out.”
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government members and opposition members, to make a draft post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem put the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the Committee and said that the group's work would be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current Constitution", and warned of interference.
Why Donald Trump will win a re-election
With that logic, Donald Trump would win the 2020 re-election unless his presidency ended prematurely through impeachment and scandal, which many liberal viewers are likely to hope for.
In what would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever!"
At the moment, there are no signs that viewers are tired.
Since 2014, best-of-the-line viewing rates have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and are nearly three times as high, 1.6 million, on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at best broadcasting time, which is an increase from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” has topped the list of cable channels with as many as 3.5 million viewers during major news nights.
"This is like a fire that people are drawn to, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, who runs the show for ABC's drama "Designated Survivor", which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack has destroyed Capitolium.
Nell Scovell is a longtime comedy writer and has written "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club". She has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Donald Trump.
Why? she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Nell Scovell tells me.
There is an entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on TV, Washington’s reporting can determine the future of the abortion case, Roe vs. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the well-being of the global economy.
Shutting down is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you have suddenly sat and watched for six hours on an expert panel debating Bob Woodward's use of "deep background sources" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's ostrich bomber jacket for $15,000 ("a garment filled with hubris," as the Washington Post said) and the meaning of the Washington Post.
I will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
“A part of what he does makes it feel like a reality series is that he comes up with something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” about the Trump sequel’s rotating cast and daily intrigues (beautiful quarrels with the NFL, praised Kim Jong-un).
If you miss a single episode, you end up on the back burner.
When I spoke to TV producer Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sun and 27 degrees outside his house in northern Kauai, Hawaii, but he was sitting and owling indoors watching MSNBC while recording a broadcast from CNN.
He couldn’t stand up, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to be brought before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Supreme Court’s future was in the balance.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs in the past and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money from outside flows into the smoothest race ever ahead of the mid-term election
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th congressional district receives a lot of money, thanks to the restructuring of a congressional district that has allowed two members to compete for the same place.
This newly renamed suburban district of Pittsburg is represented by Democrat Conor Lamb, who took his place in another district at a special election last spring.
Lamb campaigns against another member, Republican Keith Rothfus. He currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutional in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has caused a campaign finance dispute between the major parties’ finance sections, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee, (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a short win in a widely guarded special election in March to Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That place had been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts had given the Democrats a head start.
U.S. Considered Punishing El Salvador for China Support But Then Backed
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Donald Trump had a warm meeting with Panama’s President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama, until the delegates reprimanded the Trump organization’s leadership team.
Officials at the U.S. State Department decided to call home the heads of U.S. missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "noise made a decision to no longer recognise Taiwan," ministry spokesperson Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, only sanctions were planned against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control and development and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, including reduced financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit the Central American country hard with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As internal meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials launched a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in the right direction to prevent migrants from heading to the U.S.
However, in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, effectively putting an end to considerations of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will now speak at the conference, which will now take place in mid-October, which is a sign of how important the presidential administration considers the meeting to be, the diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new hard messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesperson for John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which was described by the three U.S. officials, two of whom agreed to discuss the internal deliberations against promises of anonymity.
Their accounts were confirmed by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke anonymously.
Studying History
The next inevitable step could be the special investigator Robert Mueller’s report on Donald Trump’s alleged abuse in court, for which there is now tangible evidence in public records.
Mueller is also reported to be directing his investigation into whether Donald Trump’s campaign collaborated with Russia in its attack on the US election.
If Congress were to change the majority, Trump would be held accountable to that assembly just as he prepares to run again in the election, and perhaps finally before a civil jury.
There are many uncertain factors in this, and I do not want to say that Trump will inevitably fall, nor will his colleagues in Europe.
We must all make different choices, on both sides of the Atlantic, that will affect how far the fight can go.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West had resisted him and stood behind the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
History revolves around such crucial events, and the relentless advance of democracy is either accelerated or slowed down.
The Americans are now facing several of these crucial events.
What are we going to do if Donald Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls what's going to happen to Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this newspaper reported that last year he allegedly proposed to secretly record the president, speculating that he would not be fit for office.
Rosenstein says The Times reporting is not true.
"How are we going to answer whether the FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair, or whether he is allowed to appear in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?"
And above all, in the mid-term elections, will we vote for a Congress that holds Donald Trump accountable?
If we fail in these trials, democracy is facing a dark period.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovak Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador’s residence.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me away to light the sabbatical lights on the table decorated with the accordion.
With that as an inheritance, how could I be anything but an optimist about the future?”

Graham Dorrans in Rangers is optimistic about the meeting with Rapid Wien
The Rangers will receive Rapid Wien on Thursday, knowing that victory against the Austrians after the impressive Spain match against Villarreal which ended in a draw earlier this month will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance for the season, until the 2-2 game against Villarreal. But he believes the Rangers can use the result as a stepping stone to greater success.
“It was a good score for us, because Villarreal is a good team,” says the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game thinking we could get something, and went away with a point.
We might have gotten it in at the end, but overall it was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half. We came back in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday will be an important night in Europe again.
Hopefully, we can get three points, but it will be a tough match. They got a good result at their last match, but if we have the audience with us we can certainly advance and get a good result.
Last year was very tough, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club, but now we have a good feeling.
The troops are good and the guys have fun, the training is good.
Hopefully we can move forward now, put last season behind us and succeed well."
Women sleep poorly because of fear of pension savings
Although the participants in the survey had a clear picture of how they want to be cared for, few talked to their family members about it.
About half of the people who participated in the nationwide study said they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said they had talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take the step and talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's how you can start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to give you care if you don’t talk about how you want it in good time.
Work with your advisor and family and discuss where and how you want care. Your choices can have a big impact on the costs.
Get help from your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for the costs.
Your choice of financing for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance solution, a cash-value life insurance hybrid solution to cover costs, or a self-insurance with your own funds, if you can afford it.
Establishing legal documents: Avoid legal disputes from the beginning.
Establish a care authorization, so that you can appoint a trusted person who oversees your medical care and makes sure that the care staff follows your wishes, if you become unable to communicate.
Also consider a power of attorney for your finances.
You then choose a trusted person who can make financial decisions in your place and make sure that your bills are paid if you are unable to do so yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that you have an elderly parent who is in an acute medical condition and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down such details so that you are ready.
“It’s not just the economy that’s at stake, but who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What medications are they?
Who takes care of the dog?
Make sure you have the plan ready.”
Man shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with air rifles as he walked home from a night out.
The victim, aged 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The police describe the shooting, which took place about 2:30 a.m., as a "simple event".
The victim did not see his attacker.
The injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are urging witnesses to hear from them.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia last Friday. It says officials. The death toll is expected to rise.
The communications have been shut down, and rescue personnel have not yet been able to obtain any information from the Donggala administrative area, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, and is located in a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The city's population was estimated at 379,800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is an administrative area that stretches along more than 300 km of the northwestern Sulawesi coast.
The administrative area, which is an administrative region under a province, had a population of 299,200 people in 2017.
The pillars of the province of Central Sulawesi's economy are fisheries and agriculture, particularly in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also significant in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have suffered from tsunamis several times in the last hundred years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Management Authority.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Also in 1996, the western Donggala was hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia lies in the circumpacific seismic aging, which is often affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian Aceh province on northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries. 226,000 people died along the Indian Ocean coasts. More than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with magnitude 6.8 on the Richter scale struck south of Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, triggering a tsunami that struck across the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 struck near the town of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 struck one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra. A tsunami of up to ten meters was triggered. Dozens of villages were destroyed and around 300 people were killed.
2016: A ground earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya administrative area of Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people were reminded of the devastation of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings that collapsed.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok. More than 500 people died, most on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaskan governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for abuse.
Palin, 29 years old and from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, having filed a home violence complaint, and having resisted the arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance who tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes.
Palin is detained in the Mat-Su custody and is being held against the $500 bail to be paid if the suspect violates the bail terms, according to TV channel KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "guaranteed not guilty" when asked to state his position, according to the TV channel.
Palin is suspected of three cases of less serious crimes under Class A, which means he can be jailed for up to a year and $250,000 in fines.
He has also been charged with a case of less serious Class B crime, which is punishable by a day in prison and $2,000 in fines.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with crimes.
In December 2017, he was accused of violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged crime.
The case is now being handled by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of having committed domestic violence and of possession of weapons under the influence of that incident.
His girlfriend accuses him of slapping her in the face.
Sarah Palin received criticism from veteran groups in 2016 after she had linked her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress syndrome, which stems from his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia on Friday.
The earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale, triggered a tsunami and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Electricity supply and communications are down, and the death toll is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck just outside central Sulawesi, located northeast of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
Movies that show when it hit are now circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors call for rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are calling for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the New York terrorist attack who killed eight people. It is a rare punishment that has not been executed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a rental truck from the Home Depot construction and interior design chain to carry out an attack on a cycle route along the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists in his way during the October attack.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors must prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious bodily harm, according to the declaration of intent on the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges could result in a death sentence, according to the court action.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was prosecuted by a 22-point federal jury, including eight cases of murder to support protective activities, which are often used by federal prosecutors in the case of organized crime, as well as the abuse and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “extensive planning and intent,” the prosecutors said, while describing the way in which Saipov performed it as “despicable, cruel and inhumane.”
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco damage and loss," the statement read.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The southern district of New York has not prosecuted a case in which the death penalty is claimed in a decade.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last execution of the death penalty in a federal case in New York was in 1953. The married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being sentenced to espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were both executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months that followed the attack.
According to police, he told investigators that he was satisfied with what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he received inspiration for the attack after watching ISIS films on his phone.
He also asked to put the IS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has not pleaded guilty to the 22 charges.
David Patton is one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov. He stated that they are "givenly disappointed" at the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of agreeing to life imprisonment without the possibility of conditional release if the accused confesses guilty only prolongs the trauma that these events have caused to all involved," Patton said.
Saipov’s team of defenders had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tories MP Says NIGEL FARAGE Should Be Responsible for Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" today during a protest at Torie's conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians must "feel the heat" from the EU skeptics when one of Theresa May's own MEPs suggested that he lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative member Peter Bone said at the march in Birmingham that Britain would already “have gone out” if Nigel Farage had been Brexit minister.
But the challenge that Theresa May faces in bringing the deeply divided supporters to reconciliation has been exacerbated by EU-positive Tory members, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep his compromise plan, the Chequers Agreement, alive under attack from Brexit supporters, people who want to stay in the Union and the EU itself.
Her allies have insisted that she should press and try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the backlash, forcing EU skeptics and the Labour Party to choose between her package solution and "chaos".
Bone said at a mass meeting organized by the organization Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "swipe the Chequers deal".
He suggested that Nigel Farage should have been made equal and given responsibilities in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been at the helm, we would have been out at this point," he said.
Peter Bone, who represents the Wellingborough district in Parliament, added: “I will stand up for Brexit, but we have to flush the Chequers deal.”
He made clear his opposition to the EU and said: "We have not fought world wars to become subjects.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed the allegations that public opinion would have changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British would have changed and now want to stay is completely untrue."
Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns of the Tory Party was also on the march and spoke to the journalists. "I just want to say: 'The Prime Minister, listen to the people.'
The Chequers agreement is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in the party and with our electoral workers who are out on the streets and make sure we are elected.
Put down the Chequers deal and start listening."
And she added a sharp message to Theresa May: “Prime Ministers are allowed to keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Nigel Farage said at the meeting that politicians must "feel the heat" if they were to betray the decision taken with the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is about trust between us, that is, the people, and the political class," he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to say to them, ‘We’re not going to let you get away with it.’
In front of the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is close to failing Brexit, feel the heat.
We are mobilizing the people’s army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud Britain.”
At the same time, EU supporters marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour mass meeting in the city centre.
A group of activists waved banners with the text "Tory members against Brexit" after the group was launched this weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis of the House of Lords mocked the conservatives for the security problems they encountered with a party app when the conference opened.
“These people say they can have IT systems in place and all technology for Canada plus the plus agreement, for frictionless borders and free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a pure father.
There is no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is planning an "ordinary thinker" to run for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she is going to get a "truly-minded thinker to run for president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at a city hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren has often criticized President Donald Trump, and is now running for re-election in November against Republican State Representative Geoff Diehl, who was deputy chairman of Donald Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been the subject of speculation that she may be taking on Donald Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th city hall meeting with voters since Donald Trump took office.
One person asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren replied that it's time "for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government. That means a woman on top."
A person arrested for the death of basketball player Sims from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested for the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20, had been arrested at a press conference at 11:00 a.m. for ET.
They had released a film of the shooting on Friday to help identify a man seen in the pictures.
20-year-old Sims was shot to death near Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and eventually died from this," Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday via the news site 247 sports.
Wayde went in between to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he had been on the scene and had a gun, and he admitted that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the East Baton Rouge police station.
Sims was a junior player, 198 cm tall and grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games with 10 starts last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team orders gave him a win over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes' team order would play a major role in the race.
Bottas got a good start and almost hung out Hamilton on dry when he defended his position during the first two yards, inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the pit first and allowed Hamilton to drive into the back of the clump, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes went into a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after some wheel-to-wheel action where the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside free with the risk of bidding in place after a double draw to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in the back row and was seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race and held the tires to reach a quick finish and drive around Kimi Raikkonen and turn four.
Finally, he reached the depot at the 44th lap but failed to raise the pace during the remaining eight laps when Raikkonen went up to fourth place.
It’s a difficult day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me pass by.
The team has done an exceptional job and got a one and a two,” Hamilton said.
Really bad body language
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein at a mass meeting on Saturday because she maintains that she has not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated as a judge of the Supreme Court, is accused of sexual assault.
The president, speaking at a mass meeting in West Virginia, did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee; instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "bad, nasty, and lying."
"The only thing that could happen and the nice thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry, nasty, nasty and lying," he said.
“You see press releases and leaks and they say, ‘No, I haven’t done that.
I haven't done that."
Do you remember?
Did you leak, Dianne Feinstein?
Do you remember her answer? 'Have you leaked the document?' 'Oh, what?'
Oh, no.
I haven't leaked it."
Wait a minute.
"We've leaked... no, we haven't leaked anything," he added, imitating the senator.
The letter detailing Ford's charges against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July, and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak would have come from her office.
"I have not obscured Ford's accusations, I have not leaked her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill newspaper.
"She asked me to keep this confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she wished."
But her dementia doesn’t seem to have matched the president, who commented on it this way at Saturday night’s meeting: “I’m going to tell you one thing, that was really bad body language.
She may not have done it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continues to support the candidate for the Supreme Court, which has been accused of sex crimes by three women, and he suggested that the Democrats used the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take back power with all the necessary means.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to drive over to gain power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars-Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Belfast Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars zoned Friday's loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the return match with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Belfast Giants were given an early two-way lead by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie signed for the home team before Dwyer re-established Belfast Giants leadership.
Francois Bouchard signed for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League for the season for Adam Keefe's team, who came from behind and beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season for the two teams, and the Belfast Giants had won the three previous games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on assist from Kendall McFaul, and David Rutherford provided assist when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In the intense first period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt delivered to Cownie who signed at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Belfast Giants were in the lead at the first break when he scored his second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again scored a goal in power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, and he secured the win with his team's fifth half way through the final period.
The Belfast Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home against Milton Keynes at their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controllers died so that hundreds of people on one plane could escape from earthquake
A flight leader in Indonesia is now hailed as a hero after he died when he made sure that a plane with hundreds of people on board could lift safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks continue to plague the area and many are stuck in the rush of the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Air’s flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could lift safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought it was going to fall.
He later died in hospital.
The spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved hundreds of people’s lives, according to the Australian television channel ABC News.
"We arranged with a helicopter from Balikpapan on Kalimantan to take him to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
We are devastated to hear this," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the death toll could rise to over a thousand people. The country’s disaster relief authority says that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
“The death toll is believed to continue to increase as there are still many bodies left in the ruins, and many have not been reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the government.
Up to six meters high waves have devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft fly in aid and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma told Sky News: “Every minute comes an ambulance with dead bodies.
There is nothing wrong with clean water.
Mini-markets are plundered everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will meet by there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the country’s military: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes on Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Air crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports missing man after plane crash in lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed in a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific Ocean now says a man is missing. Earlier it was said that all 47 passengers and crew had been evacuated from the sinking plane and were safe.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger was still missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it worked with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about more details about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water when it attempted to land at the airport on the Chuuk Islands.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
It is still unclear what caused the crash and what the course of events looked like.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both stated that the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some Witnesses believed that the plane slipped past the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very low.
"It's extremely good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to wade through waist-deep water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the cabin crew panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a minor skull injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby to develop a shipyard also helped in the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to drive people ashore before the plane sank into the 30-metre deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in accidents with airlines registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two years, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any of them.
Analysts draw up a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor’s page ended his plea in the second trial of a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett spoke for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used cell phone lists to puzzle the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber's movements the night she died.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which contradicts his previous claims, the Clarion Ledger newspaper reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chamber's cell phone during the period he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis stated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone lists showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final performance on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol believes that the hip hop has come a long way from its origins in political messages and attacking social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently gained a boost in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
A black again?!
A nanny in New York agrees a couple due to resignation after a "racist" text message
A nanny in New York agrees a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she received a misguided text message from her mother, who complained that she was “a black again.”
The couple denies that they would be racist and compares the mood with "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed horror when she realized that the new baby girl Giselle Maurice was black when she arrived on her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEJ NOT A BLACK ONE EVER," Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice, twice.
After she realized her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman was "bad at mods," and fired Maurice, claiming that their former nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she instead expected a Filipino woman, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for a day's work and sent home by taxi.
Now she's right the couple to get compensation for the dismissal. She's asking for compensation in the order of $350 per day for the job she was initially hired to do, which would be for six months and where she would stay with the couple. However, she didn't have a contract.
"I want to show them you don't do that," she told the New York Post on Friday.
The couple dismisses the accusations that they would be racist and says that the only straight thing was to end Giselle Maurice's employment; they were worried that they would not be able to trust her when they had insulted her.
“My wife had sent her something she didn’t mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
"But would you entrust your children to someone you would have been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Seriously speaking."
Plasco compared the mood to "extortion" and said that his wife would give birth two months later and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Are you going to look at such a person?
It's not very nice done," added investment banker Plasco.
The legal process is still ongoing, but public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media and criticized them for their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington publishers didn’t think readers could relate to a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Paddington author Michael Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, commented: “It’s hard to imagine what it was like for a person who read it for the first time before it was published.
It’s very fun, given what we now know about Paddington’s great success.”
She told her father, who had worked as a cameraman on the BBC before he was inspired by a small toy bear to write the children's book, had been optimistic when his work was rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the first edition was "bittersweet" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a “very important member of our family,” adding that her father was proud in silence of her final success.
"He was quite quiet by himself, and not a boastful person," she said.
"But Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds in something. You become proud of the child even though you are not the one who has accomplished it yourself.
I think he saw Paddington's successes a little bit that way.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always used to give Paddington the honor of himself.”
My daughter would die, and I had to say goodbye on the phone
When she landed, her daughter had been taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad, and that she wasn’t expected to make it,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad who said that she would die within two minutes and that I have to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "I love you so much, Tashi, my darling.
I'm coming to you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The medications doctors had given her to keep her heart alive slowly ebbed out and left her body.
She had died just before and now everything was extinguished.
I just had to sit there and wait and know that all this happened.
I couldn’t chew or scream or cry, because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to get together.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who were completely unaware of the difficult trial she went through.
“No one knew about it,” she said.
"I bent my head down, and the tears ran all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I felt an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Sorrowing women set up postcards to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones due to suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put up cards on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers that you can call for support.
Sharon Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and took his life when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel as bad as I do every day,” she says.
Sharon Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, telling her that her son was a promising cook who had an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew who he was because of his smile.
They said his smile lit up the room.”
But he stopped working before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
Tyler's 11-year-old brother was the one who found his brother when he killed himself in 2014.
Sharon Davis says, "I'm worried about consequences all the time."
Sharon Davis created the cards "for people to know that there are people you can go and talk to, even if it's a friend.
“Don’t be silent, talk about it.”
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, has lost his partner for 15 years, Mark, some time after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed or depressed or anything,” she says.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he behaved differently.
On Christmas Day, he was at the bottom, and when the kids opened their Christmas presents, he had no eye contact with them or anything."
She says that his death was a very hard blow for them, but they have to get through it.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as FBI investigates
"I thought that if we could do something similar to what he asked for - an investigation that is limited in time and scope - we might get some agreement," said Jeff Flake on Saturday. He added that he feared that the committee would "split" because of deeply rooted partisan differences.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate the case?
Their reluctance depends entirely on the time.
The midterm elections will take place in just five weeks, on November 6, and if Republicans make a bad election, which is expected, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the country’s highest court.
George W. Bush has taken the phone and called senators to influence them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was a personal secretary to George W. Bush.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a Senate vote, with 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the deadlock and confirm his election to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors "slows" under Kim
The number of North Koreans who defected to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong suction, citing data from South Korea’s reunification ministry, says 1,127 people jumped off last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park says tougher border controls between North Korea and China, as well as higher tariffs on human traffickers, are important reasons.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of defectors from North Korea are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most people fly via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and whose border is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korea states.
China sees the defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often sends them back by force.
The relationship between North and South, which technically is still at war with each other, has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for talks focusing on the entrenched negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to work for the Korean Peninsula to be freed from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the U.S. sanctions of the lack of success since then.
“Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we cannot disarm ourselves unilaterally first,” Ri said at a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader of the House, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was temperamentally unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi’s comments came in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had behaved like that, she would be called 'hysterical'," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became emotional when he denied the charges of sexually sacrificing Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech Kavanaugh was very emotionally touched, and from time to time he almost screamed and the voice stopped when he talked about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, saying that the charges against him were a "gross and coordinated character assassination" organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, as it showed that he is biased to the detriment of the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way in which he attacked the Clinton and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was elected, and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I can say this — if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not only unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but also to work in the court he’s at now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the Washington D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was worried about what decisions Kavanaugh might make against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe vs. Wade abortion target, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would amend certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
It is not a situation for a hysterical and biased person to sit in court and expect us all to applaud," Pelosi said.
Women have to stand out.
It is a righteous criticism, months and years of anger that boils over, and she cannot get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Ms. Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you think?"
And she continued: “I got good help from a woman who was CEO somewhere. She said that she also cried when she got angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to: ‘You might think I’m sorry because I cry.
I'm angry."
And then she continued.
I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are allowed to get an outlet for anger in part because they are often misunderstood in the basics.
One of my clearest memories from one of my first jobs in a male-dominated office, where I once cried out of indescribable anger, was that I was taken in the collar of an older woman. It was a chilly boss that I had always been a little afraid of, and she dragged me into a stairwell.
“Don’t let them see you cry,” she said to me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and happy because they managed to push you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and pulled out of the campaign, a very frustrated Schroeder felt that there was no reason not to investigate the idea of standing up for himself in the presidential election.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she said with a laugh to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates. The last thing they needed was another one.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since she was late, she was left with the money collection, and promised not to go in as a candidate if she didn’t get $2 million.
It was a project that was doomed to fail.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men only gave her $250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” she asked.
When she announced in a speech that she would not launch a formal presidential campaign, she was so overwhelmed with emotion, gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration at the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism, that the voice was stalling.
“You could have thought that I had had a nervous breakdown,” Schröder recalls on the press’ reactions.
"It could have been thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, ‘What are they going to write on my tombstone?’
"She was crying?"
Why the U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The opening hours of the US-China trade war were deafening; the war is far from over, but the gap between the countries can benefit the Chinese government in the long term, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by coating key Chinese export goods such as solar panels, steel and aluminum with tariffs.
The most significant escalation came this week, with new tariffs on goods worth $200 billion, which in practice means that half of all goods entering the United States from China are taxed.
Beijing has responded with the same coin each time, and recently it threw tariffs of between five and ten percent on US goods for $60 billion.
China has promised to match US action; the world’s second largest economy will probably not step down in the foreseeable future.
Getting Washington to back down means bowing to demands, but publicly crawling for the U.S. would be far too embarrassing for China’s President Xi Jinping.
Experts, however, argue that if Beijing plays its cards right, the press from the US trade war can provide positive support to China in the long term, by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“A quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the conditions for economic panic in either country, and it’s actually far more dangerous than viewers have previously wanted to admit,” said Abigail Grace, research assistant focusing on Asia at the think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria 'ready' for returning refugees, according to Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready to accept voluntary return refugees and appeal for help to build the country, which is in ruins after the more than seven-year war.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are now improving.
“The situation in place today is more stable and secure, thanks to our successes in fighting terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to build up the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists, in order to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
According to Al-Moualem, the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that it does not receive conditional support or assistance from countries that have supported the insurrection.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA with a 16.5 to 10.5 finish at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won again when Danish captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn’s team reached the 14.5 points required to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight hard for most of the tournament, ended up in the water at the exit of the 16th hole par 3 course, losing to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shined in all rounds and became one of four players who have ever made 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format was introduced in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth beat out 5 & 4 of the European team’s lowest-ranked players, Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's top ranked player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 & 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who may have made his last Ryder Cup.
Spaniard Sergio Garcia, a veteran with eight Ryder Cups behind him, became the tournament’s most successful European ever with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I am so happy, so happy to win back the victory.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could be of help," said one touched Garcia after the European team's victory.
He handed over the baton to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in singles on Sunday.
"What incredible pride, to be able to beat Tiger Woods. I'm grown up looking at him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France, and now has the result 13-21-3 for his career in the Ryder Cup.
A remarkable statistic for one of the world’s best players ever, who has won 14 major titles, which has only been surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find the fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after the team’s disappointing performance: “I’m proud of these guys, they’ve been fighting.
It was time this morning when we raised the temperature in Europe.
We took the fat.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a fantastic captain.
All of his 12 players played really well.
We’re going to regroup, I’m going to work on the U.S. PGA Tour and our Ryder Cup Committee and we’ll move on.
I love these 12 guys and am proud to be captain.
You have to bow and bow.
They played better than us.”
Algae flowering: Halters decrease in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report by the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission shows a general decrease in concentrations of algal blooms for parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the Commission, unevenr blooms are reported in the areas around the large municipalities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which may indicate reduced levels.
The algae bloom extends along more than 20 miles of the coast, from northern Pinellas to southern Lee.
Spots can be seen about one and a half miles out into the sea outside the large community of Hillsborough, but in fewer places compared to last week.
Algal blooms have also been observed in the large municipality of Pasco.
Medium concentrations in or off the coast of Pinellas have been reported over the past week. Off the coast of Hillsborough low to high concentrations, background concentrations to high concentrations in Manatee, background concentrations to high concentrations in or off the coast of Sarasota, background concentrations to medium concentrations in or off the coast of Lee, and low concentrations in Collier.
Reports of respiratory irritation continue to come from the large municipalities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There were no reports of respiratory irritation in northwestern Florida this past week.
