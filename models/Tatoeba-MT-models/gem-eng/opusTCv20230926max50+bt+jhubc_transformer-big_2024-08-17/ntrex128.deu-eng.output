Members of the National Assembly for Wales fear confusion with the Muppets
For some members of the National Assembly, the proposal to change their title to "MWP" (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament) triggers dismay.
The reason for this is plans to change the name of the National Assembly to “Welsh Parliament”.
National Assembly members of all political directions fear becoming the target of ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party said his group was concerned because the name rhymes with “Twp” and “Pwp”.
For non-Welsh readers: In Welsh, “twp” stands for “doof” and “pwp” stands for “aa”.
A National Assembly member of the Plaid Cymru party stated that the entire group was “not happy” and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was open to the name change, but pointed out the great similarity between "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similar to the letter u in the English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a law for the name changes, said: “The final decision on designations for the members of the National Assembly of course lies with the members themselves.”
The 2017 Government of Wales Act authorized the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the panel published the results of a public hearing on the proposals, which resulted in broad support for the name “Welsh Parliament” for the National Assembly.
Regarding the title of the National Assembly members, the Welsh Parliament Members (WMPs) or WMPs panel preferred, while the MWP option found the greatest support in a public hearing.
The National Assembly members seem to suggest alternative options, but fighting for a consensus for chairman Elin Jones, who is scheduled to submit a bill within weeks, could be a problem.
The Law on Reforms will include further changes to the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules on disqualification of National Assembly members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the National Assembly can vote on their name in their debate on the law.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on a change of country name
Voters will decide on Sunday whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was set to settle a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has a province with the similar name of Macedonia.
Athens has been insisting for a long time that the name of its northern neighbour means that this claim raises the Greek territory, and has repeatedly opposed its inclusion in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he will not accept the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's remain silent in the face of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
“The old people I spoke with said that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
“There’s no longer both of them today.”
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People’s social lives today look different,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the living room of the neighborhood where people regularly find themselves.”
At the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the church leaders assume, and that they will “be at the beginning sooner or later.”
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment houses with condominiums in which people live who do not support the remaining refuges.
“The overwhelming majority of people who buy condos in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and thus speed up the complete closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these condos will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist community moved out in the 1930s.
A black community that held its worship services nearby became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem that refused to hire or support blacks.
In a fire in 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when Father Johnson's parishioners planned the reconstruction, they commissioned the bell game.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly described the bell game as "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the bell game in July used other words: “A cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world’s first bell game played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had switched to the larger bell game at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said he was not replaced by St. Martin's.
What has taken place in St. Martin’s in recent months is a complicated story with architects and contractors, some of whom have been attracted by the lay leaders of the Church and some by the diocese of bishops.
In July, the municipal board of directors – consisting of lay leaders – expressed written concerns to the diocese that the diocese would try to pass on the costs to the municipal board, although it had not been involved in the commission of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some members of the congregation complained about a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-olds in California while diving for lobsters
In California, on Saturday, the first day of the Lobster season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy while diving for Lobster.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego, he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's cry for help and paddled to the boy with several others to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought the boy was happy to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was screaming “I’ve been bitten!
I've been bitten!".
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he found that his entire collarbone had been torn up.
“I cried that everyone should come out of the water: ‘There is a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles told the media that a few weeks earlier a shark had been seen in the area, but it was concluded that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body area.
Officials blocked the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours for safety reasons.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but they are mostly not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to push the cosmetics market in the UK
Sainsbury's attacks boats, superdrugs, and Debenhams, with cosmetics departments that look like department stores and are staffed with specialized assistants.
As part of a large-scale push to the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion cosmetics market, which continues to grow as fashion and household goods sales decline, the larger cosmetics departments are being tested in 11 stores nationwide, and if they prove successful, they will be expanded to more stores next year.
The investment in cosmetics coincides with the search of supermarkets for ways to use store spaces previously used for televisions, microwaves and household goods elsewhere.
According to Sainsbury's, for the first time, the range of its cosmetics range doubles to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees get more space and brand areas similar to those in stores like boats.
In addition, the supermarket is carrying out a relaunch of its make-up series “Boutique” so that most of the products are vegan-friendly – an aspect increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test at two Sainsbury's branch outlets, the first retail outlet opened in Croydon in southern London last week, and a second one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and the transition to the daily purchase of small amounts of food in local convenience stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to get customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, sales outlets will increasingly look like department stores, as the supermarket chain is trying to fight against discounter Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food items.
Since the acquisition of Argos and Habitat chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has established a number of habitat sales outlets in hundreds of Argos stores and a number of habitat sales outlets, which has increased food sales and profitability of the acquisitions.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to reorganize its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with boats in the early 2000s, but ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenue from the drug dealer's stores in the supermarkets.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury's sale of its 281 branch pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyd's Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
The company stated that Lloyds will play a role in the plan insofar as an expanded range of luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy is added to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have redesigned the appearance of our cosmetics departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our range of brands is tailored to all needs. Due to the attractive environment and the favourable locations, we are now an attractive destination for cosmetic purchases, which questions the previous type of shopping."
Peter Jones “insane” after Holly Willoughby’s withdrawal from a business worth <0xC2><0xA3>11 million
“Dragons’ Den” star Peter Jones is “excited” after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million business with his lifestyle brand company to focus on their new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the homewear and accessory brand Truly.
The business of the two was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
The “This Morning” presenter, 37, announced her retirement on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered “Dragons’ Den” star Peter Jones with her extremely short-term withdrawal from her lucrative lifestyle brand company to focus on her own new connectivity contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones is said to have been “awful” when the “Golden Girl” of television admitted at a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that due to their new business – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – they could no longer devote enough time to the common homewear and accessory brand Truly.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and would have likely doubled Willoughby’s estimated assets of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her retirement from Truly on Instagram, Jones left Britain on his way to one of his vacation homes.
One source said: “Truly had the highest priority for Holly by far.
It should secure its future for them in the long term over the next decades.
Their decision to withdraw was completely surprising to all involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so shortly before the market launch.
At the Marlow headquarters, a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the “This Morning” presenter, which is one of the UK’s most promising stars, could cost the company millions due to high investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and possible further delays in launching the market.
In addition, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin, have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples spend the holiday together, and Jones holds a 40 percent stake in Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willoughby is set to become a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host of the ITV show "I'm A Celebrity".
A source close to Jones said last night, “We’re not commenting on his business matters.”
Hard words “and then we fell in love”
He joked about the criticism he expected from the news media for a comment that some would consider “non-presidential” and for such positive statements about North Korea’s leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said imitating the voice of a news moderator:
“I didn’t give up.”
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, as the first meeting in Singapore in June was praised by Trump as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the denuclearization negotiations have stalled.
Over three months after the June summit in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, North Korea’s top diplomat, told leading politicians from around the world on Saturday at the UN General Assembly that the North sees no “corresponding response” from the US to North Korea’s first disarmament measures.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. was holding on to sanctions that were supposed to maintain the pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
“We are very successful with North Korea,” he said.
“We were facing a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim showed positive results: end of missile tests, support in the release of hostages, and repatriation of the remains of American military personnel.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this crowded arena, about 200 people would be standing here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia destroy an island and cost hundreds of lives
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told they would not be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population was displaced, no national emergency was declared, a prerequisite for mobilizing international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they are not requesting international support, so that is a bit difficult,” Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain if foreign employees can work on site.
Sutopo, spokesman for the Civil Protection Agency, said Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu to see if international agencies should participate in the relief measures.
In the face of the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly struggling with, the country is still sadly ill-prepared for natural forces.
While tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, these are not everyday sight on other shorelines.
The apparent absence of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, despite a warning in force, has probably contributed to the deaths.
Travelling between Indonesia’s numerous islands is already a challenge in the ideal case.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but will reach the site of the new disaster at the earliest in three days.
President Joko Widodo has made improving the impacted Indonesian infrastructure at the heart of his election campaign and spent a great deal of money on roads and railways.
However, the government of Joko, who is seeking re-election next year, suffers from funding deficits.
In addition, Joko is under pressure from ongoing religious tensions in Indonesia, with members of the Muslim majority there practicing a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were driven out of their homes and homes when gangs of Christians and Muslims fought on the streets with machetes, arrows and bows as well as other primitive weapons.
Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge to score deep goals against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday at London’s Stamford Bridge Stadium with a goal in the 89th minute ahead of a Premier League loss to Chelsea.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at his team's 0-1 break at about 27 metres from Chelsea's gate.
He aimed the ball to the left and then shot it in the direction of the rear post.
The shot sailed high above the penalty area and drifted into the right upper corner of the net.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
“I was just trying to get into this position and get to the ball, players like Shaq always play as much forward as possible, so I was just trying to make as much time as possible for me,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante come and had a contact with the ball. I didn’t think too much about it and just took the shot.”
Chelsea led by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute to halftime with 1-0.
The Blues striker gave a pass with the heel back to Mateo, then turned off near the midfield and sprinted into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic played a quick double pass in the midfield.
He then shot a good steep pass, so Hazard got into the penalty room.
Hazard left the defenders behind and closed the net with a left shot at Liverpool's Alisson Becker behind.
Liverpool will play in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea will face the UEFA Europa League videoton in London on Thursday at 3 p.m.
Number of Tsunamis deaths in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of deaths from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the Civil Protection Agency on Sunday morning.
Many people are said to be trapped in the rubble of buildings that had been brought to ruin by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake of Friday, which had triggered up to six meters of waves, authorities spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho reported in a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was littered with the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest man, 32, on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed
After finding a female body this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation was initiated.
The 44-year-old was found with stab wounds in Grayson Mews on John Street at 7:55 a.m. A 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
Police are urging residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is in an early phase, but I ask all those who have stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and have seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I ask all persons, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken something with a dashcam, to contact us, and they may have information that is of the utmost importance for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have arrived at the crime scene to find out where she was found this morning.
The investigations are ongoing, and the police said they are in the process of informing the victim’s closest relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get into his apartment, but was informed by the police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he learned what had happened.
Residents are now informed that it will take hours for them to enter the building again.
It was heard, as a police officer told a man, that now the entire area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears dissolved at the scene of the event.
She repeats, “This is so terrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police vehicles were inside the lockdown and another vehicle was in front of the lockdown.
Within the lockdown were several police officers who were monitoring the block.
Persons who have information are asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call number 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously under number 0800 555 111 and refer to protocol entry 247 of 30 September.
The Cromwell statue in front of Parliament is the latest monument to be the subject of the dispute over the rewriting of history
Their banishment would be poetic justice for his destruction of so many cultural and religious artefacts of England, reminiscent of the Taliban, by his fanatical Puritan followers.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick’s proposal as “depravity” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate about the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell’s statue image was targeted in front of the Palace of Westminster.
The picture storm in the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the false Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s magnificent portrayal of Cromwell is proof of the 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is viewed by many, perhaps at the end of the 19th century, more than today, than anyone who defended parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, by the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation is the subject of continued historical debates.
It is certain that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure that represents one side of this divide.
His achievements as a Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering."
Killer pig bites Chinese farmers dead
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China.
The man, to whom only the surname “Yuan” was named, was found dead with a severe artery overflowing with blood near a pig farm on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005.
He had reportedly arrived on Wednesday with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and saw that a door was open to a neighboring pig farm.
He said a large male pig with blood was found in the stable at the snout.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250-pound pig had killed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated," the cousin, to whom the surname was called "Wu", was quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Photographs of a security camera showed how Yuan entered the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man belonged neither to Yuan nor to his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been detained to prevent attacks on other people while police gathered evidence at the crime scene.
Yuan’s family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
It is rare for pigs to attack humans, but such cases are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, where the man suffered serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 290-pound pig squeezed a Welsh farmer between himself and a tractor until the farmer's wife could hide the animal.
After a farmer was eaten by his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs were not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood could act as “triggers.”
“They’re just playful.
They like to swindle and are very curious... they don’t want to hurt anyone.
You just have to treat them with the right amount of respect,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens on its way across the colder waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring flooding-causing rainfalls in northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
On Sunday at 5:00 a.m. east coast time, Rosa had wind speeds of 136 km/h, which corresponds to a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a trough begins to form over the Pacific toward the east to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa reaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, high tropical humidity is transported north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will cause up to 25 centimetres of precipitation in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical humidity in the coming days will produce widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest due to interactions with the attracting trough.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 centimetres of precipitation can cause dangerous flood-like flooding, water-driven debris, and possibly landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity leads to precipitation rates of almost 5 to 7.5 centimetres per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in much of Arizona, up to 5 to 10 centimetres of precipitation are expected.
Due to the spread of tropical rainfall, there is the possibility of floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
Given the threat of tropical rainfall, it is strongly advised not to go on foot into the desert.
Heavy rainfall can cause canyons to become rippling streams, and thunderstorms locally bring wind bends as well as wind that carries dust.
The approaching trough brings local heavy rain to parts of the southern California coast.
Total precipitation amounts of over one centimeter are possible, which can lead to a small extent to water-driven debris and to smooth roadways.
This would be the first rainfall in this region.
The first isolated tropical rain showers reach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, and on Monday evening and Tuesday it rains widely.
On Tuesday, heavy rain spreads into the Four Corners region and continues on Wednesday.
In October, strong temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the United States, as the Arctic cools down while the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday, there is a good example of drastic temperature differences in the middle of the United States.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of almost 12oC.
In the next few days, the ongoing summer heat will try to develop and expand again.
For much of the middle and east of the US, a warm October start with widespread temperatures around 27oC is expected from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 oC on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures in the first half of October in the east of the US.
More than 20 million viewers have seen Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million viewers have seen the compelling statements of Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated for the Supreme Court and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, on Thursday at six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued, with television stations suspending their regular program on Friday for a last-minute turn: an agreement negotiated by Jeff Flake, Senator from Arizona, according to which the FBI is to conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee to be 100% sure that Kavanaugh had been drunk at a high school party, had pressured her, and had tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% sure that this had not happened.
It is likely that more than the 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen have seen the hearing.
The company measured the average audience numbers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which had broadcast the hearing, the numbers were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems measuring audience numbers in offices.
To put this in the right perspective: This is roughly the same as the audience numbers at a play-off football game or at the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose opinion-oriented moderators strongly support Kavanaugh’s nomination, with an average of 5.69 million viewers of the full-day hearing, recorded the highest numbers of all networks.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
The interest remained great after the hearing.
Flake was the central character in the drama of Friday.
After the moderate Republican’s office released a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed on Friday morning by CNN and CBS cameras as protesters loudly crowded him in the elevator on the way to a hearing of the Judiciary Committee.
He stood with his eyes lowered for minutes while being bullied, and the scene was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the country the truth?”
“They have power, while so many women are powerless,” said one woman.
Flake said his office published a statement and added before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the hearing before the committee.
All cable and radio networks broadcast live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was to vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination to vote for the entire Senate.
Flake said, however, that he would only do so on the condition that the FBI, as required by the democratic minority, investigate the allegations against the candidate next week.
Flake can be persuaded in part by talks with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After an interview with coons and then various senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was of great importance, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes without the investigation to confirm Kavanaugh.
President Trump has prompted an FBI investigation into the allegations made against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using Brexit for political purposes
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with Sunday Times, accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of using Britain’s future for political purposes and undermining the nation’s interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will take part in the Conservative Party party congress in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published alongside the interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson exacerbated his attack on her so-called “Chequers plan” for Brexit by calling a proposal that provides for the reciprocal collection of tariffs by Britain and the EU “totally absurd”.
Deadly shots on Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the deadly shootings on Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained by Baton Rouge police for murder.
According to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the battle.
As the CBS partner station WAFB reports, the police secured the glasses at the scene of the crime and said that Simpson's DNA had been found on the glasses.
After a survey by Simpsons, police said he had been standing the deadly shots on Wayde.
The lawyer reports that the bail has been set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The police thank the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the state police forensic laboratory, the Southern University Police and the citizens of the area for their support in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the Regional Enforcement Authority for “their care and their pursuit of justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98 m grand piano player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne had also played for LSU basketball.
Last season, he scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was “deeply shocked” by Wayde’s death and “stand in shock.”
“You’re always afraid of something like that,” Wade said.
Volcano spits ash on Mexico City.
Ash ejected from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern quarter of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The agency monitored numerous cases of riots and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin ash layers on the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists noted that since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017, increased activity on the volcano located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital.
The volcano known as “Don Goyo” has been active since 1994.
clashes between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
In Barcelona on Saturday, after clashes between the readiness police and pro-independence protesters, six people were arrested and thousands attended other demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the polarizing independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists, held back by the preparedness police, cast them with eggs and also sling paint powder so that dark dust clouds were created in the streets usually populated with tourists.
In the course of the day, there were also handcuffs with the police, who used their batons to contain the fighting.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted “No Forget, No Forgiveness,” while opposing Unionists calling for “Long Live Spain.”
As the local press reported, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries during the protests.
One year after the October 1 referendum, which was seen by Madrid as illegal, but was celebrated by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region remains very tense.
The voters had overwhelmingly voted for independence, although the voter turnout was low, as the split opponents mostly boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to prevent the vote in violent clashes in front of the polling stations.
Pro-independence groups had camped outdoors overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated with his wife in the protest of the separatists, said he sees the prospect that Catalonia would gain independence, no longer with hope.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry for joy because they could choose, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite an important, albeit narrow, victory in the regional elections last December, this year’s Catalan pro-independence parties had difficulty maintaining momentum. Many of their best-known leaders are either in self-imposed exile or in prison, awaiting their proceedings for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in favor of the police on his phone, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in custody since the end of last year, announced his candidacy for the European Parliament election next year.
“To be a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the degradation of democratic values and the repression by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house was rammed by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a house in Londonderry had been rammed several times by a car.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. after British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
In addition, a crossbow may have been shot at the car.
Menga hit means 1-0 victory over Rangers for Livingston
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the victory.
The rising Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and led to the first second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga’s hit proved crucial for Gary Holt’s team to be able to equalize Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard's team will remain in the Premiership this season without a home win and will face the Hearts next Sunday, which are eight points behind.
Previously, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston can increase his winning streak in the division to six games, meaning head coach Holt hasn’t had a defeat since his takeover of Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against generously playing guests
Holt’s team would have had to be in the lead long before the hit, as his directness put the Rangers in front of a wide variety of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but slowed down in front of the gate, then Alan Lithgow was only able to shoot far after he slipped in to hit Craig Halkett's head shot past the gate.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play in front of them because they knew they could hinder guests in standard situations.
In this way, the decisive goal was achieved.
The Rangers conceded a free kick, and Livingston prepared for a chance, during which Declan Gallagher and Robinson put Menga in firing position together, who shot the goal with a ball contact from the center of the penalty room.
At this stage, the Rangers had dominated the ball possession, but were unable to overcome the defense of the hosts, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly remained largely undefeated.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos once forced Kelly to defend.
Scott Pittman was repelled by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor with his feet, and Lithgow dragged the ball past Livingston's other standard situation.
Flanks repeatedly entered Livingston’s penalty room and were regularly taken out of the danger zone, while two required penalties – one by Halkett against the substituted Glenn Middleton and one for hand-playing – were denied.
“Phenomenal” by Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were outstanding without exception and exceeded the expectations of this upward trend again.
Her playing style and her team have hardly changed since returning to the top teams, but Holt deserves great praise for the way he has shaken the team since he arrived.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall kept on trotting throughout the game.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they were at times under Gerrard, they could not reach this standard.
Their last ball was insufficient – only once they could penetrate the hosts’ team – and that’s something like a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Receiving Erdogan with Mixed Reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September) smiling faces and blue skies prevailed when the heads of government of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which should serve to repair relations between NATO allies.
There had been disputes over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police said security reasons for keeping a crowd of 25,000 people away from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters came close to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an protesters – many of them Kurds – were also heard, condemning Erdogan’s policies as well as the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The opposing protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, who is praised by some German Turks as a hero and reviled by others as an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
In a collision with a car, a cyclist has died in London.
The collision occurred at about 10:15 a.m. British daylight saving time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and medics took care of the man who died in the accident site.
Months before the accident, another cyclist had died in an accident with a driver's flight on Childers Street, about 1 mile from the accident from Saturday.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officials were working to identify the man and notify his closest relatives.
Road closures and diversions for buses are set up, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six officials injured in riots
According to the prison office, six prison officials were injured in riots in a high-security prison for men.
The riots broke out on Sunday at about 9:30 a.m. British daylight saving time at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still ongoing.
Specialized "tornado" officials were recruited to end the riots involving eight inmates and limited to one wing.
Officials were treated locally for minor injuries to the face.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to resolve an ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and want to make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and possibly spend longer behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the prison chief was being treated after an attack by a prison prisoner in the hospital.
In October last year, emergency officials were called to the prison to take action against serious riots in which the staff was attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with flood-like floods (dark areas may benefit)
It rarely happens that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but this is likely to happen at the beginning of next week, when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa move across the desert-lined southwest and carry the risk of flood-like flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of flooding on Mondays and Tuesdays from west Arizona to south and east Nevada as well as southeast California and Utah including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will approach with rain on Monday evening and move directly across Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have come close as a tropical storm or tropical depression Phoenix up to 320 kilometers!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 kilometers of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimetres of rainfall with isolated up to 15 centimetres in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the desert-style Southwest including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 centimetres are likely and can be separated up to 10 centimetres in total.
For those who are not at risk of floods, the precipitation associated with pink may be a blessing due to the drought in the region.
Although floods are of great concern, this rain is likely to be useful in some cases, as there is currently drought in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, in just over 40 percent of Arizona, at least extreme drought occurs, the second highest category," weather.com reported.
First, the path of the hurricane means that Rosa will land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa will still have hurricane strength with maximum winds of 136 kilometers per hour and will be located 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, then the hurricane will move north at 19 kilometers per hour.
In the Pacific, the storm will hit colder waters and weaken as a result.
Therefore, Rosa is expected to land on Monday afternoon or evening in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm.
The rainfall can be severe in parts of Mexico, so there is a significant risk of flooding.
“From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonora Desert, precipitation sums of 7.5 to 15 centimetres are expected, with up to 25 centimetres possible,” reported weather.com.
Subsequently, Rosa will move north across Mexico as a tropical storm, reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and then move up south of Utah through Arizona until late Tuesday evening.
“As a major threat, very strong rainfall is expected in Baja California, the northwest of the Sonora Desert, and the desert-ridden southwest of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
As a result of this rainfall, life-threatening floods and water-driven debris as well as landslides are expected in mountainous areas in the desert.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four Arrests for Attempted Murders
After finding a 16-year-old with stab wounds in Somerset, three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of attempted murder.
The teenager was found injured on Saturday around 4:00 a.m. in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital, and his condition is “stable.”
According to Avon and Somerset police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Officials asked anyone who had records of the events on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered “under the mutilation, the anger” of the Democrats.
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the unscrupulous and unheard-of tactics of the Democrats,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered “under the guise, the anger” of the Democrats throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh said Thursday before Congress and denied Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that he sexually harassed her decades ago when both were teenagers.
Ford also expressed his accusation at the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the American people saw on that day the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh.
“A vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the confirmation of one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an excellent record in the service of the public,” he told the crowd of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh’s nomination when he spoke about the importance of the involvement of Republican voters in the interim elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
I don’t act, but in reality I act,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting everywhere for great candidates.”
Trump argued that Democrats see their mission as “resisting and blocking.”
The first important procedural vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place in the Senate no later than Friday, a senior GOP executive told CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquakes in Indonesia, victim numbers rise
According to the authorities on Saturday, at least 384 people were killed, many of whom were washed away when huge waves hit the beaches due to a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday at a party on the beach of the city of Palu, when, at nightfall, up to six meters high waves hit the beach, tearing many people to death and destroying everything that stood in their way.
The tsunami was preceded by an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude.
“When the threat of the tsunami came up yesterday, people were still following their activities on the beach and did not immediately run away from it, and they fell victim to it,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian Civil Protection Agency BNPB at a conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it swam cars, tree trunks and houses, it hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people had climbed trees on the run from the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated and housed in 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs published by the Civil Protection Agency showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, arched and collapsed bridges as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was shaken by further aftershocks.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian agency BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in a statement that, in the massive quake released on Friday, energy was equivalent to 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
Due to the location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay, the tsunami could have increased, the authority said.
Nugroho described the damage as “comprehensive” and stated that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
According to him, the bodies of some victims were found among the ruins of collapsed buildings. 540 people were injured, and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of victims and the damage could have been higher along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Communication with Donggala was completely paralyzed, according to Nugrohos, and there was no information.
According to a Red Cross statement, more than 300,000 people live there, and its employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the authorities were often criticized for not informing them that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the waves arrived at the time of the warning, according to official data.
Amateur footage posted on social media shows a man on the upper floor of a building, desperate to warn people on the street beneath him of the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a water wall will power up on the shore and float buildings and cars away.
Reuters was unable to immediately verify the authenticity of the recordings.
The quake and the tsunami caused a massive power outage that disrupted communications around Palu and made it more difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
According to authorities, the military has started sending cargo planes with support from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees still urgently need food and other vital goods.
The city’s airport remains closed until October and has only been reopened for relief measures.
A visit by President Joko Widodo to evacuation centers in Palu was planned for Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims has risen to more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
World Vision employees from Donggala have safely reached the city of Palu, where the employees are housed in tent shelters in the courtyard of their office, but, according to Dosebas, they passed scenes of devastation along the way.
“They said they had seen many destroyed houses,” he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even when the aid groups began with the hard task of launching disaster relief, some of them mused that skilled foreign aid workers would be prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial aid, supplies and personnel from abroad are only possible when the site of an accident has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not happened so far.
“At the moment, it’s still a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘okay, this is a national disaster,’ we can accept international support, but so far this status does not apply.”
While the second night since the earthquake and the Friday tsunami descended over Palu, friends and family members of the still missing hoped for it on one of the wonders that lighten up the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped for two days under rubble next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others of the prisoners at the Roa-Roa Hotel were, as Mandagi added, his students.
“As a senior at paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to bear,” he said.
Gendon told how in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel among the paragliders, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to contestants from Palu who attended the beach party.
His messages, however, instead of blue ticks, only led to grey question marks.
“I think that means the news wasn’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while replenishing a cash machine in Newport on the Levee
Newport police said Friday morning in Newport on the Levee thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink’s employee while filling up a cash machine.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied a cash machine in the entertainment complex and wanted to deposit more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, “a man came after Brink’s employee” and stole a bag full of money destined for the vending machine.
According to the press release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not indicate how many people were involved in the incident.
Persons who have information on the identity of the suspects are asked to contact the Newport Police under 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name – in Ye.
When announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The being formally known as Kanye West” (The officially known as Kanye West).
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change is ahead of his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where the release of his new album “Yandhi” is expected.
He appears on the show as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producer, has canceled for “emotional reasons”.
The word is not only an abbreviation of its current professional name, but it has religious significance for West, according to its own statement.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said this year in a conversation about his album with radio presenter Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am we, it is we.
From Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, only became ‘Ye’ – simply a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, of everything.
The album reflects what we are.”
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known under the names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, with whom West has previously worked, has already written his name with and without hyphens and capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO vowed not to use the military against the civilian population
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to use military force against the civilian population during the 50th anniversary of the bloody repression against students in his country.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to “never use the military to suppress the Mexican people.”
Soldiers fired at a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people, while left-wing student movements were in the process of establishing themselves throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador vowed to support young Mexicans through monthly student support and the opening of other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities led young people to criminal gangs.
U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence
Given China’s increased artificial intelligence activities, the U.S. should double its spending on research in this area, says investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
The comments follow AI announcements from various areas of the U.S. government, even though the U.S. generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: the country intends to become No. 1 in the field of AI innovation by 2030.
“Dupling the budget for AI research would be a good start given the fact that all other countries are so much further behind the US, we are looking for the next AI breakthrough,” Lee said.
Doubling the funds could double the chances that the next major AI success would be achieved in the U.S., Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that defeated the highest-placed American Othello player, and later served as a senior executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Lee praised previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge (DARPA) and asked about the time of the next competition as he wanted to help identify the next visionaries.
According to Lee’s words, researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get government subsidies.
“Not China is taking away the academic leaders, but the companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have stopped hospices from universities that are supposed to work on AI.
In Lee’s opinion, a changed immigration policy of the United States could also be conducive to the AI efforts of the United States.
“I think that in the field of AI-promoted individuals should automatically be offered green cards,” he said.
China’s State Council presented its next-generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan (AI) in July 2017.
According to Lee’s words, the National Natural Science Foundation of China finances individuals at academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations awarding funds to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, to which partners from industry and science are expected to be involved, and the White House announced the formation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month the investment of $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) is currently investing more than $100 million annually in AI research.
In the meantime, U.S. laws regarding the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence have done nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on a change of country name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", which would settle a decades-old dispute with Greece that had blocked Macedonia's applications for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour means that it is claiming the Greek territory, which is why Greece has vetoed the inclusion of Macedonia in NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign raises doubts that the voter turnout will reach the 50 percent required for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the ballot was: “Are you in favour of membership in NATO and the EU through the adoption of the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, which includes Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, inclusion in organisations such as the EU and NATO is worth the price.
“I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough MEPs have said they would stick to the result so that it is crucial.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission said there had been no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, the voter turnout was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, with 66 percent of registered voters voting.
“I’m here to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia’s Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko cast their vote in the referendum on 30 September 2018 on changing the country name that would open the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and presented chairs in front of tents set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the raised head, not through the back entrance,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will result in much-needed investment for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
“I believe that a large majority will be for this, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after his vote.
In his words, a “yes” result would be a “confirmation of our future”.
According to a survey published Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is below the required voter turnout.
Another survey conducted by Macedonian broadcaster Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote “yes.”
In order for the referendum to be successful, the voter turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first major blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since its takeover of power in May last year.
View: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City maneuvered through the entire Brighton defense to score goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overcame the Brighton defence on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester in the 2-0 win of Manchester City.
Aguero made his hit look ridiculously easy in the 65th minute.
At the beginning of the sequence, the Argentine attacker received a pass in the midfield.
He raced between three Brighton defenders and then ran into the open field.
Aguero then saw himself surrounded by four green jerseys.
He played around a defender and then overtook several other defenders on the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
He then shot a pass to the left of Sterling.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the penalty room to play the ball back to Aguero, who overcame with his right shoe Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan and shot into the right side of the net.
“Aguero is struggling with problems in his feet,” city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that moment."
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League duel.
This gate fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball on this train far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good steep pass along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few trains to steer Sterling to the long corner.
The Sky Blues attacker targeted the ball into the net just before it slipped out.
City will play in the Champions League group match on Tuesday at 12:55 am in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim against Hoffenheim.
Scherzer wants to spoil the game for the Rockies
As the Nationals were eliminated from the playoff competition, there was little reason to force another bet.
However, the ever-powerful scherzer hopes to stand on the hill against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if this is relevant for the Rockies who have a game lead in the NL West before the Los Angeles Dodgers.
The Rockies scored at least one wildcard with a 5:2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but still want to secure their first division title.
“Although we’re not playing for anything, we can at least throw, as we know the atmosphere of the viewers here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level that I would meet this year.
Why shouldn’t I participate in this competition?”
The Nationals have not yet announced a starting player for Sunday, but are inclined, according to reports, to have Scherzer throw in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom this would be the 34th bet as a starter, practiced in the bullpen on Thursday and would throw on his normal rest day on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander has this season a statistic of 18-7, an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation related to the Brett Kavanaugh, whom he chose for the Supreme Court, when he spoke about the importance of the involvement of Republican voters in the interim elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
That’s one of the big, big ones – I’m not taking part, but in reality I’m taking part, which is why I’m fighting everywhere for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take power again by all means, they see the cowardice, the abominability.
It doesn’t matter who they hurt, who they have to overrun to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, we won’t give them.”
The Democrats, he said, see their mission in “resisting and blocking.”
“And you see that in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “awful and mean and disgusting and dishonest.”
He named the highest-ranking Democrat in the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, which sparked loud bulwarks among the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document to the outside?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh no, I'm waiting for you one — that was a really bad body language — the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour no longer holds all opinions.
The party is intolerant of those who say their opinion.
When the momentum activists in my local party voted to blame me, this was not surprising.
Finally, I am the last of a number of Labour MPs to be told that they are not welcome – just because we say our opinion.
My fellow parliamentarian Joan Ryan was treated similarly, as she had been vigorously opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for making a different opinion than Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically on similar issues Jeremy disagreed with previous top politicians.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said, “The meetings should all involve and be productive.”
Most of the Friday evening GC meetings in my eight years as a local Labour MP were exactly that.
Today, unfortunately, most meetings are not shaped by this tone, and the promised “friendly, more careful” policy has long been forgotten if it has ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that dissenting views in the Labour Party are not tolerated and that every opinion is judged on whether it is accepted by the party leader.
Colleagues with whom I previously believed to share similar political views were now expecting me to turn around and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed with, whether it be national security or the European internal market.
Whenever I speak publicly – and it doesn’t matter what I’m saying – there’s a social media chimpanzee calling for my vote to be taken, who denounces the political center and says I shouldn’t be a member of the Labour Party.
And with this experience, I am not alone.
In fact, I know that I feel better than some of my colleagues, as the comments addressed to me are mostly political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults every day and yet never give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that intoxications have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn called last week for the Labour Party to promote a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we no longer allow all opinions to apply, and with every motion of censure and every amendment of the electoral rules, the party becomes more narrow.
Over the last two years, I have often been advised to withdraw my mind and not to express my opinion so clearly, and then I would "have no problems".
But I did not go into politics for that.
Since I was a student 32 years ago, caused by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which literally caused my classroom to fall apart in the overall school, joined the Labour Party, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most – as a community council as well as as as as a cabinet minister.
I have never made a hell of my political views, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way be unclear about my political positions and areas where I do not agree with the current leadership.
I just want to say to the supporters of Friday’s request: given that the country is rushing to a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
In fact, I am not addressing this one message to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that so many electoral threats or political purpose will not prevent me from acting in the best interests of you all in my opinion.
Chris Leslie is Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr vs. Melrose 38:17: Unbeaten Ayr team climbs to the top
Two late attempts may have distorted the end result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved victory in this highly entertaining game of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
They are now the only one of the ten teams unbeaten at the top of the table.
In the end, the success of the home team was due to their superior defense as well as their better chance utilization, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve been put to the test in our games so far, and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Recognition for Ayr, they’ve made better use of their chances than we have.”
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which was increased by Frazier Climo, brought Ayr to the lead. However, Melrose was able to let the numbers speak due to a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who had been released for the game by the Warriors, and Jason Baggot caught a non-elevated attempt.
Climo expanded Ayr's lead with a penalty kick before scoring a hit right at half time and then making an increased attempt on his own, so that it stood for Ayr at break 17:5.
However, Melrose began the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was increased by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
Subsequently, there was a prolonged interruption due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, which was worn by the field. After the continuation, Ayr expanded his lead by a Climo-enhanced attempt by Stafford McDowall.
Then, as captain of Ayr, Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and again, at the end of a phase of enormous pressure, Melrose let the extra man pay by an unencumbered attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackle without a ball against Climo, MacPherson scored a touchdown from the penalty lane behind the advancing Ayr package.
Climo increased as it did almost since the breakup after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong’s boxkick and sent flanker Gregor Henry off for the fifth try of the home team.
“Still Game” star seems ready for new career in gastronomy
“Still Game” star Ford Kieran appears to be ready for a switch to the hospitality industry after it turned out that he was named CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, whose screenplays he writes and in which he plays one of the leading roles together with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the show, and Kiernan seems to be planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official registrations, he is Managing Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was interested in entering Glasgow’s “floating restaurant business.”
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, enclosed by land, hopes that a court will open its way to the Pacific
Marines patrol in front of Tauwerk’s Marine Headquarters in La Paz.
A sea-blue flag blows on public buildings.
Fleet support points from Lake Titicaca to Amazon bear the motto: “The sea is our legitimate property.
Winning it back is a duty.”
Everywhere in the country-locked Bolivia, the memory of the coastal section lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century is as vivid as the desire to cross the Pacific again.
These hopes may not be as strong as they have been for decades, as Bolivia is waiting for a ruling from the International Court of Justice to be passed on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, expects the result with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will follow the IGH’s ruling on large screens, hoping that the court in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia’s demand, which Chile is obliged to negotiate after decades of sporadic talks over Bolivia’s sovereign access to the sea.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who is facing a controversial fight for his re-election next year, the verdict on Monday is also at stake.
“We are about to return to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts consider it unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, believing that this would also change little.
The UN body based in the Netherlands is not authorized to grant Chilean territory, and has determined that it will not decide on the outcome of possible talks.
According to Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law, the judgment of the IGH was held six months after the closing plea, suggesting that the case was “not complicated”.
Far from supporting the Bolivian case, the last four years could also mean a setback.
“The current Bolivian government has torn the issue of access to the sea itself,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
She suggested that Morales' warlike rhetoric suffocated any remaining good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks at some point, but after these events this will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the view that the court’s decision was unusually quickly made.
On Monday, Bolivia has “an extraordinary opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end the 139-year disputes for mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the theme of the sea as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“The verdict is a chance to realize that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament only takes place if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if they can’t trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made during a summit between the heads of state of rivals in Singapore.
His remarks come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart the nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the summit with North Korean head of state Kim Jong-un in Singapore.
Ri described the idea that further sanctions and US resistance to a declaration to end the Korean War would ever force the North to its knees as “brain-threatening.”
Washington is skeptical and does not want to agree to the statement without Pyongyang first taking significant disarmament steps.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal in which the country probably sees the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris show the latest collections for huge headwear, which will soon be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely shield the sun, you no longer need to look.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed on the runway a range of crazy oversized headgear for their 2019 summer collection, which fascinated the fashion world at the Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations across the runway.
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was an extravagant beige-colored hat with a feather-like wide border that almost crushed the heads of the models.
As other oversized accessories, jewelled watermelons, a magic hat and even a pineapple were shown, but these are not meant to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were fitted with sewn-on lips and had more resemblance to Hannibal Lecter than to Haute Couture.
One creation resembled a diving gear, including snorkeling and diving goggles, while another looked like a melted ice bag.
And if you want to put another huge fashion statement, you’re lucky.
Fashion observers predict that the huge headgear could find its way into shopping streets near you.
The oversized hats follow directly on “La Bomba”, the straw hat with a 60 centimetre-wide rim, which from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski all wear.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat, which hit big waves on social media, sent another great creation across the runway: a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the one swimsuit-wearing model that held the bag.
The bast bag in red orange with bast fringes and a white leather heel was the highlight of Jacquesmus’ summer-2019 collection “La Riviera” at the Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect that big hats and beach bags will be available in the shopping streets for next summer. The designer has been so excited that the demand for oversized accessories will hardly be ignored.”
John Edward: Language skills for world citizens essential
Scotland’s independent schools continue to be distinguished by academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with further outstanding exam results and is only underpinned by individual and joint successes in the fields of sports, art, music and other community ventures.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the highest possible level of care for their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further education and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages are still popular and sought after in schools as electives.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart.”
This is an impressive reminder that we can not only rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The current results of this year’s exam show that languages with the highest standings are at the top of the rankings of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages achieved grade A in the higher exams.
Data from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students in Mandarin achieved Grade A in the higher exams, while 72 percent of students who learned German achieved Grade A, while 69 percent of students who learned French, and 63 percent of students who learned Spanish also achieved Grade A.
This illustrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now regarded as electives as well as STEM subjects (natural sciences, engineering, and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
According to a 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, 17 percent of the reasons employers called for the problem of filling vacancies were related to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary when it comes to preparing young people for their future profession.
As more and more open jobs require languages, this knowledge is essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen profession, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage in the future through such a lifelong ability.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give multilingual people an advantage over competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage (15 percent).
For this reason, it is important for the children of today that we now invest in language lessons.
Children who speak multiple languages, especially languages of developing countries, will have better chances of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, different languages are taught at all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages will be taught, which with a view to 2020 are considered most important for the UK, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever your child’s interests lie, at independent schools, there will always be a number of languages with appropriately specialized teachers to choose from.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills necessary for their success, whatever the future may be.
At this point in a global economic environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still of fundamental importance for the future of the country, which is why education must reflect this.
In fact, modern languages should actually be regarded as “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
I'll faut bien le faire.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent School.
LeBron ahead of Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see LeBron James perform for the first time for the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait will soon come to an end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday in the opening game of the preseason.
How many minutes he will play, however, is not yet clear.
“It’s going to be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play only a few minutes.
Earlier this week, after training, James was asked about his plans for the six-game preseason game plan of the Lakers.
“I don’t need any pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare me,” he said.
Time for Trump’s rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will start a series of campaigning events tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump’s five scheduled rallies for the next week, including in well-intentioned places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the suspended vote to confirm his election for the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming midterm elections in November as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress.
When will Trump’s rally in West Virginia take place tonight, and how can you watch online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m. (East Coast time).
You can follow Trump’s rally in West Virginia below as a live stream on YouTube online.
Trump will likely address the hearings of Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, on allegations of sexual misconduct that were conducted in a tense atmosphere this week. The expected Senate vote on the confirmation will remain in the balance for up to a week while the FBI conducts investigations.
The main goal of this rally series, however, is to support Republicans who have to stand up in a November difficult election.
Therefore, President Trump’s campaign team told Reuters that these five rallies will serve to “mobilize volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to maintain and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Congress control is so important to his plans that the president will travel to as many states as possible as the operational campaign season is approaching,” a Trump campaign spokesman, who did not want to name his name, told Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, the rally supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania could attend and report media from Pittsburgh,” scheduled for tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling.
The visit on Saturday is Trump’s second visit this month to West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to support the Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president needs to come to try and get him up in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows willingness to fight to maintain hope for the individual on Sunday
After three one-sided rounds, the four games on Saturday afternoon may have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of the momentum is a pure invention as a sports concept, but one that players really believe in, especially in competitions like this one.
Where do you think the momentum is now?
“They were in the lead with six points, and now it’s four, so I think that’s a small momentum for us,” said Jordan Spieth as he left the venue.
Europe is of course in favour and is four points ahead, while twelve more follow.
However, according to Spieth, Americans feel some wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have been playing together all day and each can show three out of four points.
Spieth was incredibly strong from the tee to the green and goes ahead with a good example.
The guttural enthusiasm screams became louder over the course of his round as he lowered an important putt to decide the fourth match with four points for both of them after he and Thomas had been back with two points after two holes.
His putt, which decided the match on the 15th hole for her, triggered a similar scream that suggests that the American team is not yet out of the game.
“I really need to kneel down and take care of my own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all that remains for the individual players.
18 holes to set a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have scored more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas, and have undoubtedly written the history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's unequal but sympathetic duo is four out of four points and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was not the only couple who had not beaten Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they had also avoided Bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and at the back nine holes on Friday morning.
This series and the seemingly flowing energy between them and the exuberant crowd underpin the fact that they are the players to beat on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players to seal a possible European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time at different holes.
Speaking of European glory, however, would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a brief trial with Sergio Garcia, the morning four-man hero who played with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine holes brought the Spaniard and the Swedes into a clamp that they could not nearly overcome.
On Sunday, however, no one can help them out of the clamp.
The four and four pairings are so close to fascinating because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give or don’t give, and the way a strategy can change in a flash.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and are clearly in the lead on the last day, but this four-round has also shown that the team of the USA is ready to fight, which some, especially in the USA, had doubted.
Europe leads the Ryder Cup on the last day with 10:6
Europe is ahead after the fours and fours from Saturday against the US at 10:6 and goes with a solid lead into the final day of the Ryder Cup.
The brilliantly playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari advanced with two wins over the struggling Tiger Woods and were thus able to score four points in Le Golf National.
The European team led by Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, who wants to win back the trophy lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated in the fours in the morning against the badly playing American team and won the series with 3:1.
In the four games, the U.S. made more resistance and won two matches, but was unable to catch up.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in the twelve singles played on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who were baptized after a sensational weekend "Molliwood", won four points only as the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup in their four opening matches.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they harmonized excellently and beat the enthralled Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who had slipped through two matches on Saturday, had his brilliance flashed occasionally, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fours and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the fours in the morning, returned and played the fours as a partner of Henrik Stenson, winning 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three in the world.
For Europe, however, on this pleasant windy day south-west of Paris, not everything ran according to their ideas.
Three-time Major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the bar for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They scored a tough 2&1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in 4&3 after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, it was only twice that a team came back after going into the singles with a four-point gap, but as a title holder, a draw is enough for Furyk's team to keep the trophy.
After only standing in second place for two days, it doesn’t look like they could start a counter-attack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepened their distrust of the United States and that under these circumstances the country would not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization’s Annual General Assembly last year that North Korea “had taken essential action out of good will,” for example stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and committing itself not to multiply nuclear weapons and technologies.
“We don’t see a response from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security, and under these circumstances we will never unilaterally arm ourselves first.”
While Ri reiterated North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to a “phased” approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded for successive steps, his statement seemed significant insofar as it did not reject unilateral denuclearization from the outset, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an incumbent U.S. President and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, in which Kim had pledged to work on the “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea’s security.
North Korea is aiming for an official end to the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, while the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington opposes calls for a easing of strict international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on “first denuclearization” and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal by coercion, and is even against the “explanation of the end of the war,” Ri said.
“The assumption that sanctions can force us to kneel is a concussion of people who don’t know anything about us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions deepen our distrust.”
Ri did not agree to plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. head of state had highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean head of state Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea were the other party on the denuclearization issue instead of the US, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to this standstill.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ris’ speech differed enormously from his speech last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target the mainland of the United States with North Korea’s missiles after “evil President” Trump described Kim as a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who had threatened the “total destruction” of North Korea last year, overthrew Kim at the United Nations with praise for his courage in terms of disarmament steps, but said that there is still a lot of work to be done and the sanctions should remain in force until North Korea’s denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it: “Whether it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, however, told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The enforcement of the Security Council’s sanctions must definitely continue vigorously until we have reached full, final and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to financially dry out Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the edge of the UN General Assembly and then said he will visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
In July, he said on his departure from Pyongyang that progress had been made, only to be accused hours later of North Korea, he had made “gangster-like demands.”
North Korea vowed this month at a meeting with Moon to dismantle a missile base and a nuclear complex if the United States took “corresponding measures.”
He said Kim told him that the “corresponding measures” were security guarantees Trump gave in Singapore, as well as steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn in one course, enough to sleep
A new course at Harvard University will ensure that all undergraduate students get more sleep this year, which is a measure against the spreading macho culture of staying awake with caffeine and learning all night long.
One scientist has found that students at the world’s leading university are often unneeded when it comes to paying attention.
Designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, the course is, in his opinion, the first such course in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
“In the end, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why am I only learning about it now, in my last year?’
According to her words, no one had ever told her how important sleep is, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
This year’s first course explained to students how the basics of good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance and also improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and managing director of the university’s health services, said the university had opted for the introduction of the course after finding that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, students will see the image of a room in a dormitory and click on coffee cups, curtains, training shoes and books, providing information on the effects of caffeine and light as well as on the effects of sleep deprivation on athletic performance and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and cancer.
They are then encouraged to think about their daily routine using a map of the university grounds with interactive symbols.
“We know it won’t change students’ behavior immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know this – just as you have the right to know how the decision to smoke affects your health,” added Professor Czeisler.
The pride of “shifting a night shift” is still widespread, he said, adding that modern technologies and the ever-growing pressure on students made the lack of sleep a growing problem.
Ensuring adequate sleep should be the “secret weapon” of all students against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said, and weight gain could also be avoided as sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode, so that they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who is studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course, having completed one of his courses in Harvard last year.
He said the course opened his eyes to him and encouraged him to push for a university-wide course.
He hopes that in the next step, all postgraduate students will be asked to complete a similar degree program before enrolling in their studies at the competitive university.
According to Professor Czeisler’s recommendation, students should set an alarm clock for sleep time and wake-up time and be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” that emanates from electronic screens and LED lighting and can get the circadian rhythm out of the clock, leading to problems with falling asleep.
Livingston vs Rangers 1:0: Menga goal defeats Gerrards player
The Rangers lost another away game when Dolly Menga's hit for Steven Gerrard's undefeated team meant a 0-1 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first away win since the 4:1 triumph at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team added Gerrard the first second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind the hearts leading by far in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga met seven minutes before the half-time, and the low-inspirational rangers seemed to have no chance of compensating.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rises to third place and is only behind Hibernian at the goal difference.
The Rangers are also threatened with further trouble after line judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound by an object apparently thrown out of the guest block.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which Ayr overtook and reached the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, stayed with the same eleven Livingston players who took the Hearts one point last week, and would have to be thrilled how his well-trained team kept their opponent under pressure on the move.
The Rangers dominated the ball, but Livingston reached more if they had the ball.
They were supposed to score a goal after only two minutes, when Menga's first release led Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his chance and shot next to it.
Then a long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow was only able to pass the rear post.
The Rangers took control, but their game seemed more hopeful than convinced in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos was obviously of the opinion that after a quarter of an hour due to a clash between him and Steven Lawless, he should have received a penalty kick, but referee Steven Thomson did not apply the Colombian's complaints.
The Rangers only scored two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's headball and a tame shot by Oviedo Ejaria.
Although Livingston's hit in the 34th minute may not corresponded to the game's course, there is no denying that they had earned him alone for their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers could not handle a ball shot by Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher shot the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept the calm and chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard traded at half-time and exchanged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent. The change was almost immediate when the winger put Morelos in position, but the impressive Kelly raced off his line to block the ball.
Livingston, however, continued to get guests to play exactly the game they were playing, with Lithgow and Halkett getting a long ball after each other.
Holt's team could have expanded their lead in the final phase, but McGregor held up well and repelled Jacobs before Lithgow shot a head ball out of the corner.
Rangers exchange player Glenn Middleton also called for a penalty kick late for a mix with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanach: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our “Sunday Morning” Almanac: On September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
The violin counter, which has since become the standard element of science, has also become a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film “Bells of Coronado” with the seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What in the world is that?”
Rogers: “This is a violin counter used to search for radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: “In fact, I hear a crack!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention, which bears his name, lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” degenerate cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” and destroy degenerate cells.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine helps the immune system to detect degenerate cells.
In the method, a patient is taken immune cells that are changed in the laboratory.
These cells can “see” a lot of cancers common protein and are then injected again.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancers.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect degenerate cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
In the method, immune cells are taken from a patient, which are changed in the laboratory so that they can “see” the many cancers common protein HER2, and then the cells are injected again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our findings suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of various types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, as explained by Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method in which patients are taken immune cells and taught to attack cancer cells has helped treat a leukaemia type.
After performing at SNL, Kanye West released a pro-Trump tirade and carried a MAGA cap ("Make America Great Again").
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was ousted at Saturday Night Live in the studio after widely praising U.S. President Donald Trump and saying he wanted to run for president in 2020.
After singing his third title of the evening, “Ghost Town,” wearing a make-America-great-again cap, he continued with a mocking cannonade against the Democrats, stressing again his support for Trump.
“I’m so often asked by white people, ‘How can you like Trump?’ He’s a racist.”
So, if I were to worry about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the allegations of sexual harassment made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the recording of West's chimphirade was not broadcast, it was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It’s not clear if Rock wanted to make fun of the release on West.
West also complained to the audience that he had trouble behind the stage because of his headgear.
“They harassed me behind the stage.
They said, “Don’t go out with your head.”
You harassed me!
And then they say I'm in a sunken area," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see the sunken area?” He said he would “dress my Supermancape, because that means you can’t tell me what I have to do. You want it to go ahead with the world?
Try it with love.”
His remarks sparked at least twice the audience’s hunch, and SNL contributors were embarrassed, Variety reported. One person told the magazine, “It was still dead in the studio.”
West was later forced to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days before.
West confused many with a lecture entitled "I Love It", in which he was dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the head of the conservative group TPUSA, and tweeted, “To one of the bravest spirits: Thank you for breaking down the mass.”
Talk show host Karen Hunter, however, tweeted that West was just himself and that was absolutely wonderful.
“But I don’t want to reward someone who, in my opinion, makes an ideology harmful to my community and gives of itself (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his ‘art’).
He's free.
The same goes for us,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and was now “The Being formally known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion, and of course Prince, the late music legend, changed his name to a symbol and then to "The Artist Formerly Known As Prince".
Accusations of attempted murder related to stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man with a knife was injured in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is due to appear in Belfast on Monday before the arbitral tribunal.
The allegations are reviewed by the prosecutor's office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO’s medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has attacked the stereotype of the Macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen often have the feeling that boys have to be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Harington said he believed something had gone wrong and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Harington, who recently married Rose Leslie, also a member of Game of Thrones, also 31, admitted that solving the problem was “very important.”
“I personally find the question of what went wrong with masculinity very important at the moment,” he said.
“What have we taught growing men about the problem we are now observing?”
Harington believes that because of the very masculine characters, television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity.
He continued: “What is innate, and what is learned?
What is taught on television and on the street that makes the boy feel like having to embody that particular side of a man?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time: how do we change that?
There was clearly something wrong with the young men.”
He also admitted in the interview that after the end of the series next summer, he would not participate in prequels or sequels of "Game of Thrones", having "enough of battlefields and horses".
From November onwards, Harington will be featured in a reissue of Sam Shepard's True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that for him, the best thing about "Game of Thrones" was that he met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife on this show, so I got to know my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose Leslie starred in the numerous Emmy-winning fantasy series Ygritte, the lover of Harington's character Jon Snow.
The two married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14°% increase in the number of people living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
In contrast to the past, transmission took place in the vast majority of new cases through sexual intercourse.
So far, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has almost been reduced to zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year-on-year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 in China.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against members of the LGBT community is said to be widespread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the disease transmissions are due to insufficient protection in sexual intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised, among other things, general access to HIV drugs to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that employees leaked the data of GOP senators, criticizing “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
Maxine Waters, a U.S. House of Representatives MP, on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff had published the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the MP’s Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat believed that the claims of “ultra-right” experts and websites would be disseminated.
“Lies, lies, and even more heinous lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information published will include the private addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was published during the hearing of a Senate committee on allegations of sexual misconduct by an unknown person in the government district against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The publication took place after the three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the contributions was assigned to Waters’ office, and published the information of a member of Waters’ staff, The Hill reported.
“This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security were endangered by these fraudulent and false accusations – was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters’ statement quickly sparked criticism online, including that of Ari Fleischer, a former White House press spokesman.
“This denial is angry,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she doesn’t have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
People who are accused of something they have not done must not be angry.
You must not be defiant.
You must not question the motives of the accuser.
You have to be calm and calm.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction to the Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of acting too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate in the mid-term elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“Great thing if that’s true,” he tweeted.
Waters said in her statement that her office had informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent allegations.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are revealed,” she continued, “and that they are held accountable for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all the members of my staff.”
Johnny English – You only live three times – weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now tradition to look for Brexit references in every British-colored new film, and this seems to apply to this revival of the action comedy parody franchise “Johnny English”, which began in 2003 with “Johnny English – The Spy Who Shrinked It” and resurrected in 2011 with “Johnny English – Now Right Now” stuttering.
Will an ironic self-parody on the subject of how obviously bullied we are become the new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, for the second time, the license of the horny, grimacing and incompetent Johnny English has been extended, signalling his name more than anything else that he is a general comic creation for cinemagoers in the non-English-speaking world.
Of course, he is once again the clumsy secret agent who, bizarrely, considers himself cool and worldly, while in reality he consists of something Clouseau, a prise Mr. Bean and a slap of this fellow, who contributed a single note to the title song of "The Victory Hour" at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
In addition, the character was originally based on the chaos left behind by travelers and international secret agents that Atkinson played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercials.
Johnny English's last adventure has one or two nice moments.
I liked how Johnny English approached a helicopter in a medieval armor and the rotor blades briefly applied to his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy comes to light, but the humor seems rather weak and strangely superfluous, especially because the “serious” film series such as “007” and “Mission Impossible” now offer self-confident comedic elements.
The humor seems to target children more than adults, and for me Johnny English’s crazy mishaps are not as imaginative and focused as Atkinson’s silent film gags in the role of the Bean.
The eternally current premise is now that Britain is in great danger.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super-secret British spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents in use, much to the defiance of the serving agent, a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, an inflated and distressed figure who is already facing the complete collapse because of her political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this quasi-Teresa May character, but the script doesn’t give much to work with.
Their intelligence advisers inform them that all active spies have been detonated and therefore they need to get someone out of retirement.
This also includes the tolpach Johnny English himself, who is now working as a teacher at a chic facility, but unofficially teaches in working as an undercover agent. There are a few gags, because English offers an espionage academy reminiscent of “School of Rock”.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former hard-tested Kumpan Bough, who is again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a nervous woman of the higher society in whose role Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who are always doing everything terribly wrong in your Majesty's secret service, are back in action, encountering Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously getting into the grip of a charismatic tech billionaire, Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of grotesque jokes: as a waiter dressed, they set a fancy French restaurant on fire, they cause chaos as they smuggle on board Volta’s luxury yacht, and English triggers pure anarchy as he tries to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta’s house using a virtual reality headset.
In this final sequence, all registers are drawn, but as sympathetic and funny as they are, the topic is already dealt with in detail on children's television.
Quite a moderate substance.
As with the other Johnny English films, I had to ask myself: “Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really meets his talent?”
Labour denies working on a plan by which the British work four days a week but are to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is supposed to consider a radical plan that foresees the British to work four days a week but be paid for five days.
According to reports, the party wants to report that company leaders will pass on the savings made by the AI revolution (artificial intelligence) in the form of an additional day off to employees.
This means that the employees would have a three-day weekend, but would still receive the same payment.
According to sources, the idea "fits" to the party's economic agenda and its plans to shift the balance in the country in favour of workers.
The transition to a four-day week was advocated by the Trades Union Congress as an opportunity for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A high-level source from the Labour Party told the Sunday Times: “By the end of the year, a policy review is expected to be announced.
“A change will not occur overnight, but a four-day working week is an effort consistent with the party’s approach to restoring the economic balance for the benefit of workers, as well as the party’s general industrial policy strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support such an idea. Already the Green Party promised to launch a 4-day week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the approach is currently not supported by the Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: “A four-day week is not about party politics and it is not considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell concretized his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour Conference last week.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of “anonymous directors” and “profitmakers” at public utilities.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that the current shareholders of water utilities may not be able to recover their full share, as a Labour government could make “reductions” due to alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed the corresponding plans to appoint employees to the boards of directors of companies and set up Inclusive Ownership Funds to hand over 10% of the equity of private companies to the employees who collect annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say in the news magazine “60 Minutes” whether the FBI investigation in the Kavanaugh case could change their mind
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his appointment as Judge of the Supreme Court by at least one week, raising the question of whether the agency’s findings could affect Republican senators to gain their support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60-minute correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring anything to light, which could ultimately change their minds.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I told the hearing that I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after that, this allegation was uttered, and asked if he had done it.
He was determined, determined, and unmistakable."
Graham’s voice appears to be carved in stone.
“My opinion is clear as to Brett Kavanaugh, and it would have to blow up a bomb,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett has denied this vehemently,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And all who called her could not confirm it.”
It is now 36 years.
And I can't see any changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has been helped to reduce poverty as part of this festival?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival takes place in New York, an annual music festival with an impressive lineup of stars and an equally impressive mission – to fight poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands will visit the Global Citizen Festival, which will be held for the 7th time this year, to not only experience the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the actual goal of the event: combating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which first took place in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. As part of this project, an international advocacy group is trying to combat poverty by motivating more and more people to actively participate in poverty reduction.
To get a free ticket for the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you need to complete a number of tasks including actions such as volunteering, communicating with a leading politician worldwide (by email or phone) or similar measures to raise awareness of the goal – fighting poverty.
How successful is the project, considering that Global Citizen will remain for 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of envisioning a cool free concert, a meaningful way to convince others that it’s time to act, or just another case of so-called clicktivism – if you think you can change something by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen announced that since 2011, the project has been able to record more than 19 million actions from its supporters and achieve various goals.
These actions are said to have helped inspire leaders around the world to announce commitments and strategies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or raised by fundraising.
According to the group’s estimates, the funds secured so far have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to supporting children in their optimal development, and who have pledged to help Rwanda fight malnutrition in the country with $35 million after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a foothold in history,” Tracey Ullman, the ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that after more than 5,000 actions calling on Britain to improve the nutritional situation of mothers and children, the government announced funding for the project The Power of Nutrition, which is intended to reach 5 million women and children and provide nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, namely the question of why Global Citizen can fight extreme poverty,
They replied, “It will be a long and exhausting road with highs and lows.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger and more influential.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, including Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as presenters.
The U.S. could use the Navy for blockade purposes to hinder Russian energy exports – Ministry of the Interior
According to the Washington Examination, Washington can rely on the Navy if necessary, so that energy from Russia does not reach the markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke claimed that the use of Russia in Syria is an excuse to explore new energy markets. Russia is currently working in these areas at the invitation of the legitimate government.
“I think the real reason for Russia’s use in the Middle East is to negotiate new markets in the field of energy, just like in Eastern Europe,” he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to address this.
“The United States, together with the Navy, can ensure that the waterways remain open and block them if necessary, so as to ensure that the energy from Russia does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit group that sees itself as the “voice of electricity consumers” in the US.
He drew a comparison between Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are virtually identical.
“The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia,” he said, while describing Russia as “one trick pony” with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The declarations were made when the Trump administration was expanding the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the far more cost-effective option for consumers in Europe.
To this end, government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump, became “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasised that the USD 11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s massive opposition to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we all believe that energy should not be used as a means of exerting pressure, and that consumers can choose suppliers themselves,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. has received counter-wind from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), has urged the United States to stay out of EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“It’s a big problem if a third country interferes with our energy supply,” says the board of directors of BDI Dieter Kempf after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to “examine” a 2020 presidential candidacy, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would “examine” a presidential candidate after the interim elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she is considering a candidacy.
According to The Hill, Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
Warren plans to “examine” a presidential candidate after November 6.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump is steering this country in the wrong direction.
“I am extremely concerned about how Donald Trump is dealing with our democracy,” she said.
Warren has not taken a leaf in her criticism of Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, she announced that, of course, an FBI investigation is required before the vote.
However, a poll published Thursday showed that the majority of Warren voters do not believe that they should run for 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe, 58 percent of potential voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
32% of voters supported such a candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick; with 38 percent advocating a potential candidacy, and 48 percent opposed.
Other names of prominent Democrats eligible for a possible 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden announced that he would officially decide by January.
Sarah Palin speaks out at Donald Trump-Ralley about post-traumatic stress disorder, under which track Palin suffers
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he’s going through when he comes back, all of that can be felt by other families who feel the effects of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers return with,” she told the audience at a ralley for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as an “elephant in space” and said about her son and other war veterans that they are coming back in a changed way, that they are coming back abjectly, that they are coming back and wondering if there is that respect for what other soldiers and pilots and any other member of the military has given the country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support an appeal for new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal remedy to new U.S. policies that deny victims of gang activity or domestic violence asylum.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district filed a court-appointed statement in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker who questions politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace versus Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal politics was not disclosed.
She said her partner "and his violent gang sons" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people apply for asylum in the United States, as nations struggling with major problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy lifted a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeal that allowed illegal immigrants to apply for asylum while fleeing domestic violence.
The District of Columbia Attorney General, Karl Racine, said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of legislation at the state, state, and international levels.”
“The Federal Law requires that all asylum applications be assessed based on the facts and circumstances of the application, and this court violates this principle,” the court’s expert statement stated.
Furthermore, the lawyers argued in the statement that policies that deny immigrants access to the country have an adverse effect on the US economy, as immigrants could be more likely to be entrepreneurs and provide the necessary workforce.
In June, Federal Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered that immigration judges no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and the violence of criminal gangs.
“Asyl exists for anyone who leaves their home country because of being persecuted or because of fear due to race, religion, nationality or affiliation with a particular social group or political conviction,” Sessions said in his June 11 policy announcement.
It was never the plan to defuse all problems by granting asylum, even all serious problems that people struggle with every day worldwide.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu as the death toll doubles over time
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly worse.
“It’s all very tense,” says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her little feverish son in a rescue center in the devastated downtown of Palu.
“Every minute comes a new ambulance with dead people.
Clean drinking water is scarce.”
Residents returned to their destroyed homes to collect their soaked goods and store everything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the staff of hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were completely overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who contracted vertebral fractures and a broken shoulder, remained outside the Palu military hospital, where patients were treated in the outdoor area due to the ongoing severe aftershocks.
With tears in his eyes, he told how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“Everything went way too fast.
I think I was trapped under the collapsed walls," he told the Associated Press, adding that the reason for staying in the city was a wedding.
“I heard my wife’s cries for help, but then there was rest.
I don’t know what happened to my wife and child.
I can only hope they are in a safe place.”
US ambassador accuses China of tyranny with “propaganda ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in an American newspaper announcing the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the U.S. Ambassador to China accused Beijing of exploiting the U.S. press for propaganda purposes.
US Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the paid supplement of the China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the best-selling magazine in Iowa, after accusing China of interfering in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6, an indictment that China denies.
Trump’s accusations that Beijing has tried to interfere in the U.S. elections are consistent with U.S. officials’ announcement to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign triggered by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a far-reaching trade war, with tariffs on imports for both countries.
Chinese retaliatory tariffs at the beginning of the trade war should hit exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, a U.S. ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa, who exports agricultural products to China on a large scale, said Beijing had damaged workers, farmers, and businesses.
China, according to Branstad in a statement in Des Moines Register of Sunday, is now doubling this tyranny by posting propaganda ads in its own free press in the US.
“With the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government claims the tradition of free speech and the independent press, proven in America, by putting paid advertising on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“By contrast, at the newsstands here in Beijing, you will find only a limited number of counter-votes and no real reflection of the differing opinions that the Chinese might have on China’s disturbing economic development, given that the media are firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that one of China’s most famous newspapers did not accept the offer to publish his article, but did not mention the name of the newspaper.
Republicans crush voters before interim elections with debacle around Kavanaugh, warn observers
As many of the most influential Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, in the face of multiple allegations of sexual violence, observers have warned of a counter-reaction during the upcoming interim elections, which could emanate from women in particular.
The mood in this context was extremely tense, and most Republicans have already mentioned that they continue with a vote.
“Such things can’t be reversed,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute push for an FBI investigation is enough to appease angry voters.
“Women don’t forget what was yesterday, they don’t forget it tomorrow, nor in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, first consultant and national spokesperson for the progressive MoveOn group, according to the Washington, D.C. daily.
On Friday morning, protesters in the corridor of the Senate called “November is coming!” when Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee decided to hold on to Kavanaugh’s nomination, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s statement, Mic reported.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are an extremely important issue, said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political observer of the news site.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially among voters in the suburbs and among younger voters, people between the ages of 18 and 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public statement, in which her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate are detailed, observers indicated that a counter-reaction could be the result if Republicans advance the confirmation.
“This situation is a confused mess for the GOP,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, NBC News.
“It’s not just about the vote of the body, the final vote, or Kavanaugh’s review; it’s also about the way Republicans handled it and how they treated it,” Guy Cecil, director at Priorities USA, a group that supports the election of Democrats, told the news channel.
The Americans, however, seem to disagree with whom they should believe on the basis of Ford and Kavanaugh’s statements, with a slightly larger share on the side of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov showed that 41% of respondents were definitely or probably convinced of Ford’s statement, while 35% indicated that they definitely or probably gave Kavanaugh faith.
Furthermore, 38% said they believe that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied to his statement, while 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating allegations brought by Ford and at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford issued an affidavit last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was attacked by the drunk Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court had exposed his genitals to her when they were at a party during their studies in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to oppose Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is currently launching a startup with the aim of establishing a competition with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
With Solid, users can choose where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee insisted that the intention behind Inrupt was “world domination”.
“We need to get active now,” he said on the topic of startup.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology so users can create their own personal online data storage or a POD.
It can include contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library, and other tools for the private and corporate sector.
Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all content is available in one browser and at the same time.
The special thing about personal online data storage is that the user can decide alone who can access what data.
The company describes this concept as personal reinforcement and development via data.
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company uses resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers hired to work on this project, as well as a community of volunteer programmers, and a security platform acquired by IBM.
Beginning this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team will not discuss with Facebook and Google whether to make a comprehensive change that will completely transform their entire business models overnight.
“We don’t ask for your permission.”
In a post on medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt is tasked with providing commercial energy generation and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new, solid-based web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee redesigned the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been instrumental in the debate on net neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am extremely confident about this new era of the web,” he added.
Bernard Vann, a priest who carried the Victoria Cross in World War I, was honored.
The only Church of England clergyman to be awarded the Victoria Cross as a fighter during World War I was honored 100 years later in his hometown.
Lieutenant Colonel and priest Bernard Vann won the award due to his efforts in the attack on Bellengrise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper and never learned that he had won the highest British war award.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Sunday.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that this act was full of symbolic power, as the memorial stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after the heroic act for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918, through dense fog and under heavy shelling of field guns and machine guns.
Later, he pushed to the fire line and led the line forward with the “greatest bravery” before driving ahead with a field weapon on his own and turning off three of the military units.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918; just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s actions were something he could never do justice to, and at the same time something that makes you humble.
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, he made a wreath after the parade under the direction of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann stated that he felt very honored to be able to participate in the parade, adding that the bravery of a real hero became visible, especially through the support of many people.
MMA fans stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, instead there was Peppa Pig
Imagine you’ve stayed awake all night to watch an exciting Bellator 206, and then you can’t watch the main event.
The San Jose bill included 13 fights, including 6 on the main map, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, viewers in the United Kingdom were not surprised when Peppa Pig was suddenly seen.
Some remained untouched after remaining awake until the early hours of the morning to specifically see the battle.
A fan on Twitter described the move to the cartoon character as a kind of bad joke.
“Due to government regulation, this content is classified as not youth-free, so it was necessary to switch to a children’s show at 6 a.m.,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa, the pig, exactly."
Bellator’s Board of Directors, Scott Coker, announced that the company will be working on the schedule to take viewers from the UK into account in the future.
“I think the problem could have been solved at the time of the replay,” he said.
“But it’s 6 a.m. on a Sunday with viewers in the UK, and we won’t resolve the incident until Sunday our time, Monday local time there.
But we'll stick to it.
There was quite a lot of communication during the change. It was quite confusing and it was not always all nice.
We have tried to solve the problem and have assumed that it is a technical fault.
What was not the case, it was a problem on the part of the government.
I promise it won't happen again.
We’re going to reduce it to 5 instead of 6 fights, as usual, and we’ve tried to give fans the best possible experience.
The whole situation is quite regrettable.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels “behind” the topic of sexuality
Tom Daley, who has participated in various Olympic games as a water jumper, says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but that feeling motivated him to become so successful.
The 24-year-old said that he had only realized at the secondary school that he was different from others.
In the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out on gay rights to encourage others.
He also said since he became a father, the victories at the Olympic Games are no longer so important to him.
The actual presenter of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, pauses for a few months due to illness.
In Laverne’s first show, he said that he used to consider himself inferior compared to others, as love for boys and girls was socially totally unacceptable.
He said, “To this day, the feeling of inferiority and being different from others is the reason for my power and strength and ultimately for my success.”
He wanted to prove that he is a very special personality in order not to disappoint anyone when his sexual orientation became known.
The two-time bronze medalist at the Olympic Games is today a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to advance the decriminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he spoke on this issue because fortunately he can live without restrictions and without discrimination and wants to encourage others.
The three-time world champion fell in love with the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013; the realization of falling in love with a man was an absolute surprise to him.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he shared that the age difference was never an issue.
He thinks if you had to go through so much as a child and a teenager – he took part in the Olympic Games for the first time at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, it’s hard to find someone of the same age with similar experiences.
The couple has had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley since June, and Daley thinks his whole point of view has changed since then.
Last year it was all about gold medals.
But for him there is now more important than Olympic gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his main win.
He bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after the diagnosis of brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not accept the approaching death, and one of the last things he asked for was the tickets for London 2012 as he wanted to be at the front.
“I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t be there anymore,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was only after that that that it finally became clear to me that he is not invincible,” he continued.
The following year, Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympic Games.
“I just knew it’s always been my dream to dive in front of a local audience at the Olympics – that was madness,” he said.
His first song selection – Proud by Heather Small – was also influenced by the song, which he heard in advance of the Olympic Games and still provided goosebumps.

Mickelson, who is currently not in shape, sits on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record at his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he has to make a lot of effort so that the whole thing doesn’t turn into a debacle.
Mickelson, who plays for the 12th time at the event, was sent to the substitute bank by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the event, as usual, the five-time Major winner spent his day cheering and working on his game, hoping to fix the problems that plague him.
Even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old Mickelson was never the most direct golfer and thus not an ideal cast for the tight Le Golf National golf course, where misguided balls are regularly penalized.
And as if the pitch itself wasn’t daunting enough, in the ninth game on Sunday, Mickelson meets the perfectionist British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood, a newcomer to these tournaments, to win all four games this week.
If the Americans with four points behind put a hot start in the 12 individual games, Mickelson’s game could prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in Mickelson and could not add much to it either.
“He was perfectly clear about his role today, gave me a pat on my back and put his arm around me and thought he was ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence.
He is one of the world-renowned personalities and he has done so much for these teams in the past and also this week.
I didn’t think he would be in two games.
I had imagined more, but that’s how it went and that’s what we expected.
Like everyone else, he wants to be there.”
Mickelson will reach the Nick Faldo record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup race that never quite matched the highlights of his personal record.
Mickelson can record 18 wins, had to put in 20 defeats and reached seven halftimes, although Furyk announced that his presence alone has enriched the team.
“He’s funny and sarcastic, original and likes to make a few jokes, and he’s a great person who’s popular with the whole team,” he explained.
“I think the younger players were happy to get to know him a little closer this week, and it was fun to watch them.
He’s a really interesting person who gives a lot of impulses.”
Captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn knows it can be over with the lead soon
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a big advantage that leads to the last single games in the Ryder Cup can quickly become an unpleasant situation.
The Dane debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but only barely got over the finish line and took the lead with the smallest possible lead, gaining a 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 victory.
“The thought remains that we had a big lead in Valderrama, we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but only barely,” said Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn (pictured in the photo) after seeing the 5–3 Class of 2018 victory both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10–6 at Le Golf National.
The experience shows me and all the team members that it is not over.
Tomorrow is going to be the right thing to do.
Put yourself in the stuff and do exactly what's right.
The whole thing is only over when the points are on the display board.
We want to win this trophy, and that’s where our focus is.
I’ve always said it, I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we’re fully aware of what’s facing us on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Glad about the performance his players have accomplished on a difficult golf course, Bjorn continued: “I would never rush that.
Tomorrow will be another calibre.
Tomorrow the individual benefits are in the foreground and that is a completely different thing.
It’s great to work with a partner if things are going well, but if you’re out there alone, you’ll be tested to the limits of your skills as a golfer.
You have to make this clear to the players: get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he has to get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk will make sure that his players perform individually better than in the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have won three out of four points.
Furyk himself stood on both sides of those big turnarounds on the last day of the tournament. He stood in Brookline on the winning side before standing on the side of the losers after Europe's "miracle of Medinah".
“I remember every damn word,” he replied to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you’d like to take off the quick start you’ve seen in Brookline and Medinah.
When the momentum strikes in one direction, it puts the middle games under a lot of pressure.
We set up our team accordingly and send our guys out as we feel, you know, we're trying to conjure up tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of retrieving in return, he must compete in the top game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as other Europeans in the top half of the rankings.
“I chose the guys in that order because I think it covers everything,” Bjorn said of his selection for the individual meetings.
Germany's new warship delayed again
The latest frigate of the German Navy should have been put into service in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War era, but according to local media, it will not be delivered until the earliest next year due to faulty systems and rapidly growing costs.
The commissioning of the “Rhineland Palatinate”, the flagship of the brand new frigates of the “Baden-Württemberg” class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship should have been put into service in 2014, but the ambitious project was plagued by disturbing problems after delivery.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, ordered by the Navy as early as 2007, are to replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
They are designed to include a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft missiles and sea target missiles, as well as camouflage technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
Another important feature is longer maintenance periods. It should be possible that the latest frigates do not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
However, the ongoing delays can lead to the fact that the state-of-the-art warships, which Germany is supposed to represent as naval power, will already be obsolete at the time of their commissioning, according to Die Zeit.
Last year, the F125 frigate, which was followed by the accident, went into the headlines when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy returned a ship to the shipyard after its delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media called a number of significant “software and hardware failures” that would have rendered the new ship unusable in a combat situation.
Software problems are particularly serious, as ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are served by a crew of only 120 sailors, only about half as many as on the older frigates of the Bremen class.
It was also known that the ship is far too heavy, which leads to performance losses and prevents the Navy from carrying out upgrade measures in the future.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate was apparently twice as heavy as ships with a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the training costs of the crew, also became a problem.
Apparently, the cost increased to a staggering €3.1 billion, compared to the originally planned €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly significant given the recent warnings that Germany’s naval power is shrinking.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the German Bundestag’s defence commissioner, confirmed that the Navy “exceeds the operational ships”.
Bartels said the problem got bigger over time, as old ships were taken out of service but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could be taken from the navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
In an estate in the Scottish Highlands, new research is being carried out to show how bats use the landscape when searching for food.
It is hoped that the results will provide further insights into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will trace dwarf and mosquito bats as well as brown langöhr and water bats in Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices are placed at key positions on the property to record the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations using portable detectors.
In a noise analysis of all recordings by experts, the frequency of bat calls is determined and which species does what.
Then a map and a report of the habitat are created to create a detailed picture of their behavior at landscape level.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This data will help determine the benefits of habitat management measures, such as the creation of meadows, and show how to preserve forest areas for bats and other related species.
The bat stocks in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping places and leads to the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as flycatchers and the chemical treatment of building materials or attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation to detect insects and obstacles in their trajectory.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout Scotland, takes the subject of bats very seriously.
He has 10 trained experts who regularly conduct examinations, inspections of sleeping places and sometimes rescue measures.
The organization has even established Scotland’s first and only bat sanctuary at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s 10 bat species.
Property manager David Thompson explains that the property is the ideal habitat for her.
“Here in Threave we have a great area for bats,” he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent habitat.
But there is much we don’t know about bats yet, so here and on other goods we are doing these work that will help us learn more about what bats need to feel comfortable.”
He stresses the importance of excluding the presence of bats before maintenance work in the goods, since it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single nesting site could kill up to 400 females and young animals and wipe out the entire population on site.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass, or destroy their nesting sites.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the population to help.
She explains: “We still have to learn a lot about bats, and in many of our species we don’t know what their populations are.”
Ronaldo denies rape charges while his lawyers want to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called rape allegations against him “fake news” and said people want to be “famous” by using his name.
His lawyers plan to sue the news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The striker of the national team of Portugal and Juventus Turin was accused of raping an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to buy her silence on the incident, according to Der Spiegel on Friday.
In an Instagram live video of his 142 million followers, 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports just hours after their release as “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they have reported today: Fake News," said the five-time winner of the Ballon d’Or to the camera.
“They want to profile themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
You want to be famous with my name, but that's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue the mirror for the allegations they described as “inadmissible reporting on privacy suspects.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player demanded compensation for “moral damage at an amount equal to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident occurred in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in 2009.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped them anal, according to documents filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo went to his knees after the alleged incident, and she said he was “99 percent a good guy” who had succumbed to “one percent.”
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but say it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had taken photographs of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she had “fear of retribution” and worried about being “publicly humiliated.”
The 34-year-old said she is now trying to cancel the agreement because she was still traumatized due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to switch from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged incident and switched to Italian giant Juve in a €100 million deal this summer.
Brexit: The UK would ‘ever regret’ the loss of automakers
The UK would “eternally regret it” if it lost its status as a world-leading manufacturer of cars after Brexit, said Minister of Economy Greg Clark.
He went on to say that it was “concerning” that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily interrupt production at the Burnaston plant near Derby, should Britain leave the EU.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker stated that the impact of border delays on a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The plant in Burnaston, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis product lines are produced, produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I am convinced that we will experience production stops at our plant in an uncontrolled Brexit at the end of March,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s Managing Director at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also raised concerns about a hard EU exit without agreement and its impact on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says it will close its mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns, according to automakers, are associated with risks within the supply chain in the event of a hard Brexit.
Toyota’s manufacturing facility is operated on a “just-in-time” basis, meaning that the parts are delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers from both the UK and the EU to make the cars on order.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be interruptions at the borders that, according to the industry, could lead to delays and bottlenecks in parts.
It is impossible for Toyota to keep a stock at the Derbyshire plant that lasts longer than a day, the company explained why production had to be interrupted.
Clark explained that Theresa May’s Chequers plan on the future relationship with the EU “is precisely designed to avoid such controls at the border.”
“We need a deal, we want the best deal that allows us, as I said, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to seize this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4.
“The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we need to be able to continue the very successful supply chains so far.”
Toyota could not specify how long production would have to be interrupted, but warned in the long run that additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been employed in Burnaston for 24 years and is the highest official of the Unite union at work, explained that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, these jobs never come back once they are gone.
A government spokesman said: “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's planned meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be postponed “for another week,” while the dispute over the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein has investigated the oversight of the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigated the election interference by Russia, connections between Trump’s advisers and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the President.
The question of whether Trump would fire the deputy justice minister and thereby jeopardize Mueller’s independence has been the subject of rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein addressed the possibility of secretly recording his talks with Trump and impeaching the president using the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday, while new reports about his alleged resignation became known.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was at that time at the UN General Assembly in New York, was announced for the upcoming Thursday,
Trump said he would prefer not to dismiss Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid colliding with the hearing before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, said.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate’s full vote.
Trump's spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
She replied to a question about the meeting with Rosenstein: “A date has not yet been set for this, but it could be this week, but I can also imagine that it will be postponed by another week, given all the things that are currently going on with the Supreme Court.
But I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders explained that the low frequency of press conferences does not lie in an aversion to the TV reporter’s “effect-hashery,” but admitted, “I wouldn’t deny that they are doing effect-hashery.”
She then claimed that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The president makes more question-and-answer rounds than any president before him,” she explained, without giving any precise evidence: “We looked at these numbers.”
There will still be press conferences, Sanders said, but if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it will be far better than talking to me.
We try to do this often, and you have seen that we have done it often in the last few weeks, which will take the place of the press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why this is the case when he performed a rowing and sometimes bizarre performance in front of assembled reporters.
Minister of Health writes about Brexit concerns about EU employees of the Scottish NHS
The Minister of Health addresses people from outside the EU who work in Scotland’s National Health Service (NHS) to express the country’s gratitude and desire to remain in the country even after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has already agreed to bear the cost of applications for residence permits for EU citizens working in Scotland’s decentralised public service.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, the exit negotiations between the UK and the EU continued and decisions are expected this fall.
However, the British government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I am aware of the worrying times this must be for all of you.
That is why I wanted to express once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each and every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and thus benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is fully your home and we would be very happy if you would stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after a head injury
The linebacker of Tennessee State Tigers Christion Abercrombie, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee State, was subjected to emergency surgery after a head injury he contracted on Saturday at the 31-27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the half-time break.
“He came to the sideline and just collapsed there,” Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff supplied oxygen to Abercrombie on the sidelines before he was placed on a carrier and transported for further investigation.
A spokesperson for Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie left the surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “no details of the nature or extent of the injury are known yet” and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a so-called redshirt, plays in his first season at Tennessee State after switching from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 tackles, increasing his total number during the season to 18 tackles.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp tax for property purchase in the UK
Investors from abroad will have to pay a higher stamp tax for the purchase of real estate in the UK in the future. The additional income will benefit the homeless according to the new plans of the Conservative Party
This step is intended to curb the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to curb young voters
The increase in stamp duty will affect anyone who does not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects additional revenues of up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp fee if you buy properties in the UK, with additional income to benefit the homeless.
This move represents an attempt to curb Jeremy Corbyn’s success among young voters who promise to provide more affordable housing and target top earners.
The increase in stamp duty is levied on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and the additional revenue is to be added to the government campaign against homelessness.
The surcharge charged in addition to the current stamp tax and including the increase introduced two years ago on second homes and residential properties left for rent could be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the move to generate additional revenues of up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by investors who are not based in the UK, which drives prices up and makes it more difficult for first-time buyers to gain a foothold in the real estate business.
Many affluent areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “hospital cities” due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the UK.
The new strategy follows just a few weeks after Boris Johnson advocated reducing the stamp tax to allow more young people to own their first home.
He accused construction companies of raising property prices by buying land without using it, and urged Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable housing to end Britain’s “living space shame.”
Opposition leader Corbyn announced an eye-catching set of proposals for housing reforms ranging from a rental price commitment to banning evictions without good reason.
He also wants to give city councils more powers in the construction of new apartments.
May said: “Last year I said that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream, according to which the life from generation to generation should be better.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build a life.
However, it may not be right that for people who do not live in the UK, as well as for companies based abroad, it is just as easy to buy real estate as it is for hard-working British citizens.
The dream of home has become too distant for too many people and the unworthiness of homelessness continues to be too big a problem.”
Jack Ross: 'My biggest goal is to manage Scotland'
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, says it is his “greatest goal” to eventually become the manager of the Scottish team.
The 42-year-old Scotsman has the challenge to breathe new life into the club from the north-east of England, who is currently in third place in League One and missing the three points to the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the first Scottish League last season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I made it to the bank and that’s it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“But as a child I have often seen Scotland play in Hampden with my father and that’s something that always draws me back.
However, this possibility would only come if I were successful in club management.”
Ross' predecessors in the role of manager of Sunderland include Dock Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic stated not to be afraid to step into the footsteps of such established names at such a club, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The success will be measured at the moment by whether I can bring the club back to the Premier League.
Given the structure and possibilities in this club, he is undoubtedly a member of the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get him there, but I would probably only consider my time here as a success if I bring the club back there.”
Ross has a three-year management career, after a period as deputy head of Dumbarton and a 15-month tenure as coach in Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from the relegation to the third league and helped St. Mirren from the edge of the relegation to win the championship in the following season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever in his playing career with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“This was probably a real crossroads,” he recalls when he took over Alloa’s responsibilities.
“I really believe that management was the right thing for me, more than games.
It sounds weird, as I didn’t do badly, could live well from it and experienced some very pleasant highs.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things you have to go through every week.
I still do this with regard to the stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I've always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it. I've never felt so comfortable in my skin all my life as an adult."

The perfect time for a glass of beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., according to a study
The heat wave in the summer has given rise to the revenue of UK’s crisising pubs, while restaurant chains have been under greater pressure.
Pub and bar companies recorded revenue growth of 2.7 per cent in July, but revenue at restaurants fell by 4.8 per cent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin of the CGA management consultancy, who compiled the figures, explained: “Continuous sunshine and England’s longer-than-expected ongoing participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern to the previous June, in which pubs were able to record sales increases of 2.8 percent, but restaurant found it even more difficult.
The decline of 1.8 percent recorded by the restaurant industry in June continued to increase in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on drinks showed by far the best performance, with a space-adjusted revenue development that rose higher than it dropped at the restaurants.
Pubs with a focus on food also suffered in the sun, but not as drastic as the restaurant operators.
It seems like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In the managed pubs and bars, beverage sales rose by 6.6 per cent per month, while food sales declined by three per cent."
Paul Newman, RSM’s leisure and restaurant analysts, said: “These results continue the trend we have been seeing since the end of April.
The weather and influence of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors for sales in the out-of-home market.
It’s not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle with problems, but revenue losses of 4.8 percent compared to the previous year will be particularly painful in addition to continuing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for operators of companies focusing on food and it remains to be seen whether the more temperate temperatures in August will provide the much needed respite."
Total revenue growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in brand rollouts.

One in five children has secret accounts on social media that hide it from their parents
One study shows that every fifth child, some just 11 years old, has secret accounts on social media that keep it secret from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 students in secondary schools found an increase in so-called “fake insta” pages
The message fuels fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students said they had a “main account” to show it to their parents.
One in five children, some just 11 years old, creates accounts on social media that can keep it secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students at secondary schools showed a rapid increase in so-called “fake insta” accounts, a reference to the photo-sharing website Instagram.
The message fuels fears that sexual content will be shared.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean “main account” that they can show their parents, but they also had private accounts.
One mother, who came across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter, found a teenager who urged others to “rape me.”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which admitted to owning private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of the HMC, said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are being tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to be "Voice of Athletes" in the Scottish Sports Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive member of the Scottish Athletics Council at its annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most distinguished athlete and Chairman Ian Beattie described the election as a great opportunity for sports officials to benefit from her extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh is respected in the athletics community of Scotland, Great Britain and the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland would greatly benefit from their choice in the council,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I look forward to acting as the voice of the athletes and hope that I can make a real contribution and lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the distance over 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, calls a total of four Olympic gold medals his own and today often appears as a BBC expert, could no longer run after a transient bleeding disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “One month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
Doctors say that no one can tell if or how far I will be cured.
It was hard work, but I completely recovered, learned to run again and do mobility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging news!"
An advertisement for milk pumps that compares mothers to cows provides excitement on the web
A manufacturer of milk pumps provided excitement on the net with an advertising clip comparing breastfeeding mothers to milking cows.
In order to launch the “world’s first low-noise portable milk pump”, the manufacturer of consumer technology Elvie published a not very serious music video to emphasize the freedom that the pump gives breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn with cows in the background to a song that contains lines of text such as: “Yes, I’m milking, but you don’t see a tail in me” or “if you haven’t noticed it, these are not udders but my breasts.”
“Pump it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies.”
However, the advertising published on the company’s Facebook page has sparked a controversy on the web.
With 77,000 hits and hundreds of comments, the video came across mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom say it harmed the “fear” of the dairy industry.
“It was a very bad decision to promote this product with cows.
Just like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their boys will be taken away from them within a few days of birth,” the statement said.
Elvie's milk pump discreetly fits into a still bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment read: “Recognisably traumatic for mother and baby.
But hey, why don't we use them to promote a milk pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another person added: “Such a non-reality advertising.”
Others defended the ad and a woman admitted that she found the song "original".
“I think that’s a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I were still breastfeeding.
When I was pumping, I felt just like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I'm not trying to over-interpret it.
It’s a great product,” one person wrote.
Another person commented: “This is a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who use milk pumps (often in the workplace or on toilets) and feel like cows.
This is not an advertisement for or against the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that everyone danced with the discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the realization that many women who use milk pumps indicate they feel like dairy cows.
However, Elvie’s pump is completely silent, has no wires or hoses and discreetly fits into a still bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies or even go out during the pumping process.
Ana Balarin, Partner and ECD at Mother, said: “Elvie’s pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative market launch.
By comparing breastfeeding mothers with dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk pumps and all the associated challenges, while simultaneously presenting in a fun and comprehensible way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump allows.
This is not the first time Elvie’s pump has been in the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, designer Marta Jakubowski showed a two-time mother on the catwalk while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were quietly taken to a tent city on the Texas border
The number of interned migrant children is as high as never before, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively the same, including as heightened rhetoric and measures by the Trump administration have made it more difficult to accommodate children with caregivers.
Traditionally, most caregivers themselves were illegal immigrants and are now afraid to become the target of deportation even when they sign up to take a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential supervisors and other adult members of their household would have to hand over their fingerprints and this data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior customs official for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, announced before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for the care of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous entries in the criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of people who are either themselves caregivers or members of a caregiver’s household are illegally staying in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens.
That’s why we will continue to pursue these people,” Albence said.
In order to be able to process children’s cases more quickly, officials introduced new rules that, according to the staff of the accommodations for some children, require them to appear in court within a month rather than 60 days after the detention, which was previously the standard.
Many will appear via video and not in person to appear before an immigration judge for their legal status.
In the event of negative decisions, the person is quickly deported.
The longer these children remain in custody, the more likely it is, according to the accommodation staff, as well as reports that have been reported from the system over the past month, that they will become anxious and depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or attempted outbreaks.
Defenders say that these concerns are exacerbated at a larger facility like Tornillo, as there are signs that a child has problems being more easily overlooked due to the size.
They also explained that trauma, which many of the children are already suffering, could increase if they are taken to a tent city without emotional preparation or enough time to say goodbye to friends.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish ‘occupational troops’ to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, explained that the foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil with the pretext of fighting terrorism and are “treated accordingly”.
“You must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more people have been expelled from their homes.
He said Damascus “will continue to fight this holy battle until all Syrian territories are cleansed” by terrorist groups as well as “any illegal foreign presence”.
The United States has stationed some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem explained that the conditions for their return were given and he accused “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational fears” to keep the refugees from going home.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to enable the return home,” he said.
“They are politicizing a purely humanitarian matter.”
The United States and the European Union warned that no aid would be granted to Syria as long as there is no political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
Diplomats of the UN stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib represents an opportunity to advance political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey turned a broad-based offensive of the Russian-backed Syrian forces to the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had “clear deadlines” and expressed his hope that military action against jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front allied with Al-Qaeda, will be “exterminated.”
UN Representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meeting of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem called the conditions of the Syrian government for participation in the committee and stated that its work should be limited to the “review of the articles of the current constitution” and warned of interference.
Why Trump will win his re-election
With this logic, Trump would win his re-election in 2020 if not, as many liberal viewers probably hope, an impeachment or scandal ended his presidency prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of a presidency of all time”.
So far, there is no indication that the audience is tired.
Since 2014, the turn-on rates have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News reached an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best broadcast time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” led the turn-on rates to 3.5 million viewers in evenings with important news.
“It’s like a fire that magically attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Bear, showrunner of the drama series “Designated Survivor” broadcast on ABC TV about a cabinet member who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an old-fashioned comedy writer and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneakering Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club” has a different theory.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
She asked him why.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” said Scovell.
Chaos has an entertainment value.
Of course, unlike anything on television, the stories from Washington can determine the future of the principle decision on abortions Roe v. Wade, the possible merging of families and the health of the global economy.
Switching off is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen, if one becomes aware of having already watched six hours of an expert round, about Bob Woodward's use of sources from the so-called "Deep Background" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar bomber jacket made of ostrich leather (according to the Washington Post, a "clothing piece rich in self-overestimation") or the effects of Stormy's description of Daniel.
I will never be able to see Super Mario again with the same eyes.
“Part of what he’s doing makes it feel like a reality show he’s putting on every night,” says Brent Montgomery, chief executive officer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the series “The Three of the Pledgehouse,” about Trump’s rotating cast and daily turnarounds (breaking a fight with the NFL football league from the fence, praising Kim Jong-un).
You can’t afford to miss a sequel, otherwise you won’t be able to join in.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was sunny 27 degrees outside his house on the north coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he crammed inside and looked at MSNBC while recording CNN at the same time.
He simply couldn’t get away from the screen, not if Judge Brett Kavanaugh was about to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows back then and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Donations flood the narrowest races around seats in Congress in the interim elections
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is flooded with donations, thanks to the newly drawn boundaries of the electoral districts, which led to two officials standing around the same seat in the race.
The recently re-drawn suburban district in Pittsburg leads Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb opposes another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th district.
The cards were redrawn after the Pennsylvania State Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts violated the constitution and were manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district sparked an exchange of campaign funding between the major party financial weapons, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a brief victory in a much-regarded special election in March around the 18th electoral district of the state.
This seat was held over a decade by a Republican and Trump won there with 20 percentage points ahead.
Politicians give the Democrats an easy lead.
The US reviewed El Salvador’s punishment for its support for China, but then withdrew.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing without encountering great resistance from Washington.
Trump held a friendly meeting with Panama’s President Juan Carlos Valero in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners threw the management team of the Trump Organization out.
U.S. State Department officials have decided to withdraw the heads of all U.S. foreign missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to “the recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan,” said Heather Nauert, the ministry’s spokeswoman in a statement earlier this month.
However, only in the case of El Salvador was thought about punitive measures, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was to follow a similar assembly in the previous year and represented a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from moving towards the United States.
In mid-September, however, senior government officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, effectively ending the consideration of punitive measures for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak at the conference scheduled for mid-October, according to diplomats, to signal the importance that the government is giving to the assembly.
The three U.S. diplomatic representatives have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new bold announcements or punitive measures from Washington.
A John Bolton government spokesman declined an opinion on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to comment on the internal meetings on the condition of anonymity.
Their comments were confirmed by an external analyst close to the government, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Learn from history
The next big surprise could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, for which there is now sufficient evidence in public.
Mueller is also reportedly investigating whether Trump’s campaign team conspired with Russia in its attack on the American elections.
Should the majority of Congress change, Trump sees himself faced with an organ that forces him to be held accountable, precisely at the time when he is about to step back in front of the voters; and possibly before a jury.
These are many ‘ifs’ and I don’t want to say that the case of Donald Trump, or that of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we must make decisions that will affect how long the battle will take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler if the West had only resisted him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We have failed, and missed a way to avoid the years of barbarism that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the unstoppable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are facing several such turning points.
What do we do when Trump dismisses Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who decides the future of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in Teufel’s kitchen since this newspaper reported last year that he proposed to secretly record the president and speculated that he was unfit for office.
Rosenstein denies the portrayal of the New York Times.
“How will we respond if Brett Kavanaugh’s newly ordered FBI investigation is not complete or fair, or he is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and misrepresentation in office?
And most importantly, will we vote in the interim elections for a Congress that forces Trump to account?
If we fail in these tests, we will have a long winter ahead of us.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me off 60 years later to light Sabbath candles on the table with the hook cross.
How can I not be optimistic about this legacy?”

Graham Dorrans from the Rangers optimistic about the match against Vienna
The Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a victory against the Austrians after the impressive draw against Villareal in Spain at the beginning of the month will put them in a good position for the qualification of Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury, Graham Dorrans could not appear until the 2-2 tie against Villareal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a stepping stone for bigger ones.
“This was an important point for us, as Villareal is very good,” said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game with the conviction that we can make something out of it and we drove home with one point.
Maybe we could have won in the end, but overall a draw was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we struggled in the second half and were then the better team.
Thursday will be another great European evening.
Hopefully we get three points, but this is going to be a tough game as they have achieved a good result in the last game, but I am sure we can go through this with the audience behind us and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a kind of feel-good factor.
The team is good and the guys are really good at it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now look forward, leave the last season behind and be successful."
Fear of retirement leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although the survey participants knew exactly how to care for them, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the participants in Nationwide’s study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but don’t take the necessary steps to lead the conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance division.
You should start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t express your wishes in time.
Work with your advisor and family to discuss where and how you want to be cared for, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor on board: your advisor can also help you find a way to finance these expenses.
Your long-term care financial decisions may include traditional care insurance, hybrid capital-forming life insurance to help cover these costs, or self-insurance with your own assets — as long as they own the money.
Work out your legal documents: Get rid of litigation at the last minute.
Set up a precaution mandate so that you hire a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that the healthcare professionals comply with your wishes, you should be unable to express it yourself.
Also consider a power of attorney for your finances.
You choose a familiar person who makes financial decisions for you and ensures that your bills are paid should you not be able to do so.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your older parent has a medical emergency and is on their way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication intake or allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
“Not only the financial issues play a role. Who are the doctors?” asked Martin.

Man shot in Ilfracombe multiple times with air rifle
A man was shot several times with an air rifle when he went home after working with friends.
The victim, a man in the 1940s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen, and hand.
Officials described the shootings that occurred at about 2:30 a.m. British time as a “involuntary act.”
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening and police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities.
Due to the failed communication systems, aid workers were unable to obtain information from the Donggala government district, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a government district that extends in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi over a coastline of over 300 km (180 miles) in length.
In the administrative district, an administrative unit below the province, lived an estimated 299,200 people in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income of the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesis.
According to Indonesia’s Civil Protection Agency, Palu and Donggala have been victims of earthquakes and tsunamis several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
West-Donggala was hit in 1996 by a tsunami in which nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire, and is regularly visited by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatras triggered a tsunami on 26 December that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, nearly half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatras between late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias Islands off the coast of Sumatras.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake shook southern Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast and claimed nearly 700 deaths.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 struck the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 shook one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters high, destroying dozens of villages and demanding about 300 lives.
2016: A slight earthquake shook the Pidie Jaya administrative district in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people died from crashing buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the Indonesian island of Lombok, which is popular with tourists and claimed more than 500 deaths on the north side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the island.
Sarah Palin's son arrested for allegations of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaskan governor and former vice-presidential candidate, was arrested on charges of bodily injury.
The 29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of domestic violence and resistance to state violence, according to a report released by Alaska Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he picked up a friend's phone when she wanted to communicate with the police.
According to KTUU, Palin is in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and a $500 security deposit has been charged.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where, when asked about his plea, he responded with “not guilty, quite sure,” according to the network.
Palin is accused of committing three Class A offences, which can be punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B offence, which can be punished with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that Palin has been prosecuted.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being discussed in front of Alaska’s Veteran’s Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting a crime and possession of weapons under the influence of narcotics in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran organizations in 2016 after she traced her son’s behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his time in Iraq.
Tsunami after earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake that shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude quake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are interrupted and it is assumed that the number of deaths will increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of Central Sulawesi, located northeast of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
On social networks, videos circulate from the moment the wave hit the country.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors call for rare death penalty for suspects in New York terrorist attack
The federal prosecution in New York demands the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the defendant in the New York City terrorist attack, which cost eight lives, a rare penalty that has not been imposed in the state since 1953 for a federal crime.
30-year-old Saipov is charged with using a hired pick-up of the Home Depot chain for a terrorist attack, during which he rode a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, crossing pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims “targeted” and inflicted “consciously” serious bodily injuries, according to the memorandum of intent for the death penalty that was filed in the southern district of New York.
Both charges could be punished with death, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal court of inquiry, Saipov, filed a 22-point indictment, which includes eight charges of murder against the background of organized crime, which are usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, as well as an indictment of the violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack calls for “fundamental planning and intent,” according to the prosecutors, who described the way Saipov carried out the act as “disgusting, cruel and depraved.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov inflicted damage, pain and loss on the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
For more than a decade, the southern district of New York has not pursued a case with the aim of demanding the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers and eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in New York City in a federal offense was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple convicted of espionage for the Soviet Union two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, testified in the days and months after the attack of lack of remorse, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to act after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also demanded, according to police reports, to hang the flag of ISIS in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, stated that they were “of course disappointed” due to the decision of the prosecutor’s office.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty, instead of accepting a confession of guilt in exchange for a life sentence without the possibility of dismissal, will only prolong the trauma suffered by all those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecution not to demand the death penalty.

Ukip’s former party leader stated that politicians must “feel the pressure” of Eurosceptics, while a member of Theresa May’s party suggested that Farage should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the protesters in Birmingham that the UK would be “ready out” if Farage were Brexit minister.
The challenge facing May in reconciling her deeply divided party has been exacerbated by the fact that members of your party, who are in favour of staying in the EU, took part in a separate demonstration against Brexit that took place in the city.
The Prime Minister has problems keeping Chequers on track despite attacks by Brexit proponents, Brexit opponents and the EU.
Ally insisted that despite the counter-reactions, they should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels, forcing Eurosceptics and the opposition Labour Party to decide between their package and the “chaos”.
Bone explained at the Leave Means Leave demonstration in Solihull that “chequers belong to the garbage.”
He suggested that Farage should have been appointed a peer and that he should have been given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he were responsible, we would already be outside,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I will stand up for Brexit, but Chequers is on the rubbish.”
He stressed his opposition to the EU: “We did not fight in world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone rejected allegations that public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their minds and now want to stay in the EU is completely wrong.’
The Brexit supporter of the conservative Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration, explaining to reporters: ‘I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The compromise is unpopular in public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and with our activists who are actually going through the streets and making sure we are elected.
Please give up Chequers and start listening.”
In a sharp message to May, she continued: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs if you keep their promises.”
Farage said in a speech that politicians need to “feel the pressure” if they are about to cheat on the 2016 referendum decision.
“This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” Farage said.
“They’re trying to cheat Brexit and that’s why we’re here today to tell them, ‘that’s not how you get out of it.’
In front of an enthusiastic crowd, he went on to say: ‘I want you to let our political class, who is about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.
“We are mobilizing the power of the people of this country, which has helped us win the referendum and will never come to rest as long as we are not an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A few activists waved banners from the Tories Against Brexit group, a group of Brexit opponents within May’s party, which was launched on the weekend.
Lord Adonis, Peer of the Labour Party, made fun of the Tories who had security issues with a party app at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can make sure that the IT systems, as well as all the technology for Canada Plus, for the smooth border, are there for free trade without borders in Ireland,” Adonis said.
“This is a farce.
There is simply no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to ‘examine’ presidential candidate
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would “take a close look at the presidential candidacy” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with voters in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump, is currently in the race for re-election for the Senate against Republican MP in the Massachusetts Parliament Geoff Diehl, who was vice chairman of Trump’s Massachusetts campaign team in 2016.
She was the center of speculation that she could challenge Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was the 36th meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall format since Trump’s inauguration.
One of the people present asked her if she wanted to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that it would be time for women to “go to Washington and repair our broken government and that includes women at the top.”
Arrest after death on LSU player Sims
Baton Rouge Police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the case of fatal shots on LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference that it had arrested 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. Eastern Time.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the man seen on the footage.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot on Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to his head and died as a result of this injury,” said police chief Murphy J. Paul on Saturday, according to the sports media portal 247sports.
Wayde wanted to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to having been at the crime scene and possession of a gun and shooting at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incident and detained in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The two-meter Sims grew up in Baton Rouge and played in 32 games with 10 starting positions last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after his team has given him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the time Valtteri Bottas landed on Saturday in qualifying ahead of Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that Mercedes' stall orders would play a major role in the race.
From pole position, Bottas made a good start and it was almost as if he was leading Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel first went into the box and had Hamilton hit traffic at the end of the driver's field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the box a round later and landed behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after a tight wheel-on-wheel maneuver, in which the Ferrari driver reluctantly released the inside, with the risk of holding out after two moves to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started on one of the back squares of the field and was in seventh place on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round.
He was then the fastest for much of the race as he held on to his tires to finish quickly and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally went into the box in the 44th round and failed to take a step in the remaining eight rounds, while Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day, as Valtteri has been doing an excellent job all weekend and acting like a real gentleman when he was supposed to let me pass.
The team has done excellent work to achieve a double win,” Hamilton said.
A case of really bad body language
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein at a campaign event on Saturday, insisting that Christine Blasey Ford’s letter, in which she accuses the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse, did not pass it on to the press.
At the event in West Virginia, President Ford’s statement did not address the Senate Judiciary Committee directly, but commented that the Senate proceedings show that people are “common, bushy and dishonest.”
“One thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has happened in the Senate in the last few days is when you see the anger when you see people who are angry and mean and mean and vicious and dishonest,” he said.
“When you look at the leaks and then say, ‘Oh, I wasn’t.
I wasn't."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Think about your answer... Published the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Okay, just a moment, please.
If we have it... no, we haven't published it," he added, mimicking the Senator's voice.
Feinstein received the letter with Ford's charges against Kavanaugh in July and it was released in early September, but Feinstein denies that the leak is from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t publish your story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep the letter secret and I responded to her request for secrecy.”
Her dementi did not seem to be well received by the president, who said on Saturday evening at the campaign event: “I tell you one thing, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his ongoing defense of the judge candidate accused of sexual assault by three women, the Democrats claimed the charges would be used for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
You see the mess, the malice, they don't care who they hurt when they get under the wheels to get power and control," the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made the defeat on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by a 5:3 win in the backgame in Dundee again on Saturday.
The Giants led early with two goals, after hits by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the balance for the home team before Dwyer restored the lead of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard was in Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen won with two goals.
This was for the men of Adam Keefe, who unexpectedly beat Dundee on Friday night 2-1 in Belfast, the third defeat in the Elite League in the season.
This was the fourth clash of the season between the two teams, with the Giant winning the three previous games.
Dwyer's opening door was opened in the fourth minute after 3:35 minutes after a Kendall McFaul presentation, and four minutes later David Rutherford delivered the presentation when Beauvillier expanded the lead.
In this exciting opening phase, Sullivan brought the home team back to the game after 13:10 minutes, before Matt Marquardt Cownie helped out to its compensatory gate after 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer secured the lead of the Giants before the half-time break when he scored his second goal of the evening just before the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again equalled with a power play hit in the 28th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second half, and Nielsen then secured his team victory with a fifth goal after just half of the second half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home at Milton Keynes Stadium next Friday.
Air traffic controller died after making sure hundreds of people on a plane escape the earthquake
A plane pilot in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he found his death in order to safely launch an aircraft with hundreds of people on board.
Over 800 people died and many are missing after the island of Sulawesi was shaken by a devastating earthquake that triggered a tsunami on Friday.
Strong aftershocks are still felt in the region and many people are trapped under rubble in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues have fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the swinging control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained to make sure that the flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
He then jumped out of the tower when he thought he was falling.
Agung later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for the Indonesian Air Safety Service, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia’s ABC News.
“We provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter could arrive in Palu.
We are deeply concerned about this message," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of dead could increase to several thousand. The country’s Civil Protection Agency stated that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The number is expected to continue to rise as many bodies are still under the rubble, while others cannot be reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency.
Waves up to 6 meters high have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring relief and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute comes a new ambulance with dead people.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Supermarkets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we don’t know what they’ll find there.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get much worse.”
Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and declared in a speech to the country’s military: “I ask you to work all day and night to complete all the tasks associated with the evacuation.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was already shaken by earthquakes in Lombok this year, in which over 550 people died.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline, which carried out the flight that plunged into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now reports a missing person after initially claiming that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a statement that they can’t say anything about a passenger’s stay until Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline said there were six more passengers in the hospital on Saturday, but they were in a stable condition.
The cause and the exact course of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both stated that the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was flying over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very flat.
“That’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes explained that he and others could wade to the emergency exits on the side of the sinking aircraft by means of deep water.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy stated that sailors working nearby to improve a docking station rushed to help with an inflatable boat to bring people to the coast before the aircraft sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network data, 111 people have died in the crash of Papua New Guinea-registered airlines, but none of them were affected by Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the course of the night in which a woman was burned alive
The indictment ended Saturday’s trial of a case in which a man is accused of banishing a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, said for hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He explained to the jury how he reconstructed the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on her death night.
Rowlett said he received position data from various mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the evening of her death, which contradicts his previous statements, according to Clarion Ledger newspaper.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the period he stated to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford went to the witness stand on Saturday and said he had not been in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he stated that he had been in Sanford's pick-up that night, Sandford said he had lied "as my pick-up was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis stated that he had known Chambers for two weeks at the time of her death.
However, cell phone records indicated that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that Tellis was releasing their messages, calls, and contact information from his cell phone some time after Chamber's death.
“He pulled them out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is expected to begin its pleadings on Sunday.
The judge assumes that the trial will then go before the jury on that day.
The High Breed: What Is Conscious Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that Hip Hop has moved away from its roots in the political message and social commitment.
They want to make back to its roots and again socially conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common recently experienced a renaissance in the UK by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
New York nanny sues couple for dismissal after “racist” SMS
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she received a misguided message from the mother, in which she complained she was “still a black man.”
The couple denied being racist and compared the legal dispute with a “blackmail”.
Two-time mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her dismay when she found out that the new day-mother, Giselle Maurice, was black when she started her first day of work in 2016.
“NOEEEEEEEEE, ANOTHER BLACK,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent the message to Maurice twice.
After recognizing her faux pas, Plasco-Flaxman released Maurice, claiming that the open-minded African-American midwife had done bad work and she had instead expected a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her working day and then sent home with an Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for the discharge and claims compensation for the $350 per day that she should have spent over six months on the job for which she was originally booked, but without a contract, and for which she would have lived with the couple.
“I want to show them, look, you don’t do that,” she told the newspaper on Friday, “I know that’s discrimination.”
The couple rejected the racism allegations, arguing that the dismissal was the reasonable step since they feared Maurice, after insulting them, would no longer be able to trust.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you entrust your children to a person who was rude to them, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the lawsuit to a “blackmail” and explained that his wife expects a baby in just two months and is “in a difficult situation”.
“Do you want to interest such a person?
That’s not very nice,” the investment banker added.
As the lawsuit continues, the couple was quickly condemned in public and denounced on social media, where they were criticized for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared readers wouldn’t identify with a talking bear, a new letter reveals
Karen Jankel, daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the book’s adoption, said of the letter: “It’s hard to get into someone reading it for the first time before it was published.
Today it’s very funny with our current knowledge of Paddington’s huge success.”
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a small toy bear to write the children's book, would have had no problem with it, had his work been rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication after his death in the last year was "bittersweet".
She explained that her father was secretly proud of Paddington’s success, which she describes as “very important family member.”
“He was a very quiet man and didn’t brag,” said Jankel.
“Because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child doing something special: you’re proud, even if it wasn’t really your own performance.
I think he saw Paddington's success like that.
Although he invented and created it, he always gave Paddington himself responsibility for its success."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone
After landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that it looks really bad and that the doctors gave her little chance,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got the call from Nad, where he told me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I told her, “Tashi, I love you so much, my darling.”
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping slowly faded and left her body.
She had died shortly before and this was the moment when everything went down.
I couldn’t do anything except wait while I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to pull myself together.”
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the loss of her daughter, went on board the plane with the other passengers who didn't know what she was going through.
“No one knew,” she said.
I had lowered my head and tears ran over my cheeks all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Sad women hang up cards to prevent suicides on bridges
Two women who have lost relatives through suicide try to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hung up on a bridge in Wales maps with inspiring messages and phone numbers for counseling centers.
Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began suffering from depression and was just 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want parents to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, explained that her son had a promising career as a cook and he had a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could brighten a room."
However, he quit his job before his death because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's body was found after the suicide of his then 11-year-old brother.
Davis said: “I always fear that this could have a consequence.”
Davis designed the cards to “show people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.”
Don’t be silent: you have to talk about it.”
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she was 15 years old, shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he felt down or depressed,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day, he was at the low point, and when the kids unpacked their presents, he didn't see them in the eyes or anything."
She said that his death was a big trauma for her, but that had to go through it: “It’s tearing a huge hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to go on and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's Future in the Float as FBI Begins Investigation
“I thought if we could actually get something like this that he asked for, that is, a time-limited investigation, then maybe we could get a little agreement,” Flake said on Saturday, fearing that the committee would “break apart” in the party-political stalemate.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want FBI investigations?
Their reluctance can be attributed to the timing alone.
The midterm elections on November 6 are only five weeks away, and if Republicans fail as expected, they would be significantly weakened in their attempts to elect their husband to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush seized the telephone listener to call Senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh, who had worked for Bush in the White House and met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There is a vote in the Senate, which currently seats 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It’s still unclear whether Kavanaugh can unite at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to decide on voting equality and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean defectors ‘sinks’ under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-seug, which relies on data from the South Korean Reunification Ministry, explained that 1127 defectors were registered last year, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park called stricter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher prices of human smugglers as the main factors.
Pyongyang did not publicly comment on this.
The vast majority of defectors from the North are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most flee across China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China considers the defectors to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often leads them back by force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still in a state of war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two heads of state met in Pyongyang to discuss the denuclearization negotiations.
This came as a result of the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, in which they generally agreed to work on a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho, however, accused the U.S. of failing to make progress.
“Without being able to trust the United States, we have no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to disarm unilaterally first,” Mir Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's not fit for the Supreme Court office
The minority leader in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called Judges candidate Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said that he was characteristically unfit for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t deny the impression that a woman who acted in this way would have been called ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh’s statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
During his opening speech Kavanaugh was very emotional. Sometimes he almost cried and was about to burst into tears when he talked about his family and his high school time.
He has also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him a “gross and coordinated assassination” organized by liberals who are angry about Hillary Clinton’s lost presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's statement proves he can't serve at the Supreme Court as they show he's biased towards Democrats.
“I believe he has declared himself unfit with these statements and the way in which he used to refer to the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to take Kavanaugh out of office if he should be confirmed and the Democrats should win the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I will say so much: if he does not tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he is not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but also for his current judgeship,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Appeals Court in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi said she was concerned as a Democrat about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion policy decision Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh questioned whether he would revise certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“We don’t need a hysterical, biased person who goes to this court and expects us to say, ‘Ah, that’s not wonderful,’” Pelosi said.
Women need to use it as a weapon.
It’s a sincere hate speech, months and years of overcooking anger and she doesn’t get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s rare, and you?”
She continued: “I was helped a lot by a woman who was a manager somewhere and said that she was crying when she gets angry but developed a technique. If she gets angry and starts crying, tell the person to whom she said: “You might think that she’s sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
And then she just keeps talking.
I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is of a former job, in a male-dominated office, where I cried one day because of an indescribable rage, and of an older woman, an under-cooled manager, for whom I was always a little afraid, wrapped in a collar and dragged into a stairwell.
“Never let her see you cry,” she told me.
“You don’t know you’re stinky.
They believe that you are sad and will be content with them because they believe you have gone to the substance."
Patricia Schroeder, then a congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidatures.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on board a ship called Monkey Business in an extramarital affair and then withdrew his candidacy, the deeply frustrated Schroeder considered that there was no reason not to consider the idea of the presidential candidacy himself.
“That wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me 30 years later with a laugh.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Since the election campaign had already progressed, it was behind fundraising and she vowed not to run if she didn’t get $2 million together.
It was a hopeless struggle.
She found that some of her supporters, who donated men $1,000, only supported her campaign with $250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” she asked.
Speaking in which she announced not to launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration about the system that made raising funds and directly addressing voters instead of delegates so difficult, as well as the anger about sexism that she was so close to tears.
“It could have been assumed that I was suffering from a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls of the press reactions.
“It could have been thought that the handkerchief manufacturer Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember asking myself what they would write on my tombstone.
“She was crying?”
Why Beijing could benefit from the US-China trade war
The opening ointments of the trade war between the US and China were deafening. Although the battle is far from over, Beijing could benefit from a trench between the countries in the long run, my experts.
Donald Trump, the American president, fired the first warning shot at the beginning of the year when he fined important Chinese export goods, including solar cells, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods, effectively affecting half of all goods imported from China to the US.
Beijing struck back in the same way each time, recently raising punitive duties of five to ten percent on U.S. goods worth $60 billion.
China vowed to respond to any U.S. measure and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economic power will soon stumble.
Moving Washington to move in would mean giving up, but a public slump against the U.S. would be far too tasty for China’s President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts believe that if Beijing plays out its cards well, China could benefit from the long-term effects of the trade war by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision could create conditions for economic turbulence in either Washington or Beijing is actually much more dangerous than many observers have previously recognized,” says Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria is 'ready' for the return of refugees, the foreign minister said
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help in rebuilding the country devastated by the war lasting over seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government is rebuilding the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, which they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government welcomed help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that it would not accept any conditional aid from countries that had supported the uprising.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europa won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated Team USA with a 16.5 to 10.5 finish at Le Golf National near Paris.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown back after Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems over much of the tournament, lowered his tee on the 16th track (par 3) in the water and lost to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all his rounds and became one of 4 players who scored a 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5:4 by the player with the lowest ranking in Team Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The player with the world's best ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 against Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spain’s Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player of all time with 25.5 career points.
“I usually don’t cry, but I couldn’t hold back today.
It was a difficult year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I am so happy to win the trophy back.
It’s about the team and I’m happy to have made a contribution,” says the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the torch on to his compatriot John Rahm, who won against American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday 2:1 in the individual encounters.
I’m so incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, whom I’ve been following on TV since I was a kid,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now has a Ryder Cup balance of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 important titles and is surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA had trouble finding the fairways throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who posted top-class performances throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I’m proud of the guys they fought.
There was a time this morning when we had put pressure on Europe.
We didn't do anything about it.
Hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players performed well.
We will regroup, I will talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I’m proud to be their captain.
You have to pull the hat.
We were defeated.”
