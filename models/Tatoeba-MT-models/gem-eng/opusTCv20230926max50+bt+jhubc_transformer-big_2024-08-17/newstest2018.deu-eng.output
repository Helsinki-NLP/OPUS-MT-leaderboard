Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
A crazy place where young people are supposed to meet today.
A pit chapel, where now is dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Kleing<0xC3><0xA4>rtners manage the former land of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories to the day.
It's annoying when maps aren't up-to-date.
Everyone knows this because the car navigator showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.
The historical maps of the digital Bavaria Atlas, an offer of the geoportal Bavaria of the state government, are anything but current - but very revealing for that very reason.
Especially if you compare them to current online maps.
Then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the area of distribution of the Munich Mercury have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern Atlas is a patchwork rug that is not recognized as such.
More detailed maps, so-called original position sheets, were incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities.
These were created according to the Bavarian Surveying Administration between 1810 and 1864 and were the result of Bavaria’s first survey.
Your client: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria with Austria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.
Even though the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801: it was the neighbours of today who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map.
Elector Max IV. Joseph further advanced the project, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Surveying Administration.
The original position sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found, like all others, on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.
The comparison earlier/today is most impressive with the example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which still appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was incorporated 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. 1877, as a district of Munich.
Today Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the present-day Plinganserstra<0xC3><0x9F>e, which was not until 1878 named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.
Where today the Westpark is, you see nothing but fields - at first glance: When zooming in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-numbered corridors from the so-called "uptake" from which the property tax was derived.
Small plots no longer occupy farmers there today - but gardeners of the "Land in Sun" plant.
A large green area stands out north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the venue of the Oktoberfest, was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the original position sheet, in the area of today's district of Au-Haidhausen, you can read not only the street name "am Gasteig" or from the hill "Auf der Venten" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on Auerfeldstra<0xC3><0x9F>e, people with delusions were once locked in.
In 1858/59, the Munich-based Kreis-Irrenanstalt "Auf der Auer Lüften" was founded.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - the psychiatrist who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chaining of the so-called fools.
In addition, he has forbidden staff to use force against the inmates,” says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, which has been engaged in an exhibition with the institution.
For 280 patients, there was room at first, and later it was extended to 500 places.
At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar in 1905.
Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of Germany’s largest psychiatrists, has been located there.
At the site of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in the Salesianum in Munich.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training companies.
West is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east residential buildings from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - in architectural terms, on the basis of the original building of the Irrensanstalt, which had been destroyed during World War II in bombings.
The Marienplatz was listed as "Main Square" around 1856, the Kaufingerstra<0xC3><0x9F>e was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
The Allied bombs broke many holes into the city centre in December 1944.
A big one remained to this day - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a medieval pit chapel once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preliminary work took place and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line took place.
With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with today's aerial image - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.
Civil Rights Group Releases Travel Warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colored People has issued a warning to colored people who travel to Missouri due to the state’s discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is scheduled to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, racially-based incidents have recently occurred throughout the state and are noted here," the group said in a statement.
A recently passed Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state’s law enforcement agencies disproportionately targeting minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel alert, the NAACP said.
"They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed,” said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet."
It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more gasoline during the state trip and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
The Council also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General’s Office, which shows that black drivers in the state are stopped 75 percent more often than whites.
“The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends, and co-workers about what might happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
"People need to be ready to bring bail money or let relatives know that they are traveling through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI’s hate crime reporting program, which ranked the state 16th in terms of the number of such violations.
The travel alert is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations, which, according to the ACLU, will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Weidefenprojekt is elementary
The Fischerbach Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year.
The CDU MPs Peter Wei<0xC3><0x9F> and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture on the spot.
At the Rechtgrabhof of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbach CDU-Ortsverband met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.
Markus Schwendemann initially provided insights into his operations, in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, provides 40 dairy cows and as many young animals as possible and hosts holiday guests in five apartments.
The "black forest milk" is for him the alternativeless marketing route for the milk of his cows, says Schwendemann.
On the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regional.
Since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the pasture fence project as "elementary important".
I cannot profit on such steep areas.
The grassland area takes care of a lot of work, much has to be worked with the motor nose.
"We are struggling here with the conditions and topography," Schwendemann stressed.
In 2003 he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he does not run an organic farm.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the pasture fence project and is happy about the Leader funding".
At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.
It is hoped that the reforestation of the areas could be extended for a long time.
“The biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their business,” he said.
Farmers are often criticized for their support.
A total of 25 parcels of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 via the grazing fence promotion.
The surface area is thus 40 hectares, which may not be forested until at least 2023.
Of the total costs of 71,500 euros, half was funded via Leader, a quarter was carried by the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus, the farmers remained at 12,610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture fence.
“The big advantage is the durability of the fences,” Schwendemann explained.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You are doing a really good job, without farmers and rural women it is not possible".
Peter Wei<0xC3><0x9F> also said, “Best food is produced here.”
The Landschaftspflege Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg provides state support for pasture fences.
The goal is to keep the Black Forest open.
A prerequisite is the presence of a funding curve designated by the LPR.
In addition, the area to be fenced must not be dredgable (hanging above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by reforestation.
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaunproject 2018, the application for eight participants with 24 plots is currently underway, which want to build almost 16 kilometers of fence.
The open area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112,000 euros.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Now the White House of Trump is taking over the Statue of Liberty
The safest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the president’s proposals for drastically restricting legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.
To remain fair, Miller did not attack the statue himself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he had.
But he seized its importance, and in particular the importance attributed to it, when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument.
As Miller Acosta once said, “I don’t want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem to which you refer, which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller is factually correct, but as he himself put it, it’s not really about history.
It’s about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state not only invites some old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: “Your tiredness, your poor, your oppressed masses, who long to breathe freely, the miserable waste of your rich coasts.”
There has never been a time when the “wrong waste” on our screens could be seen better.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trump's U.S. are not welcome.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.
Lazarus – and her friends, who were committed to placing their words at the base after her death – knew very well that they were doing a highly political action.
The sculpture was intended to show the links between French and American republicanism by portraying in a worn-out classical pictorial representation the female embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a completely different name: the mother of exiles.
The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the significance of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this back for a long time.
The great shrewd Rush Limbaugh, a type of John the Baptist for Trump’s coming, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not inviting anyone, but rather an early neoconservative who brings the American flame into the night-time world: “Lady Liberty is moving forward.
It is intended to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch should not illuminate the path to the United States."
Quite unusually, Limbaugh has come across something here.
The significance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.
Lazarus’ great act of imagination was to see it as it was seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
In the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear.
And of course, that’s not the perspective Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch should not illuminate the way, but ignite hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team
UK Athletics Performance Director Neil Black says the 16-member Scottish contingent in the World Cup squad will “make a massive contribution to the team.”
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017 starting on Friday.
Black believes that "something special developed in Scotland" and the UK's athletics needs to learn something from it.
“We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue to do so until we find out,” Black said.
“I’m talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they’ve done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British Athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart – who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m stretch, while Eilidh Doyle was selected by the team as team captain.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible," Black said.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room feeling very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in were great.”
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will compete in their fifth World Championships at the 400m hurdles, says it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's best total number of athletes so far at the World Cup was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.
Muir, a mid-distance runner, has set five British and two European records in the past year.
It will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.
Chris O’Hare, who runs 1,500 metres, is another Scotsman to watch after a great season that included winning the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scotsman on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says that she is "enormously proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases will also participate in the medals and finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and elected me makes it something very special for me," she added.
"Obviously, I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team.
It just shows how far we have come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb on podiums.
What about my speech as a captain?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a World Home Championship.
So it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from being back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there."
Blocking critics over Facebook: Don’t apply for a public office if you can’t afford to heat up voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for the newspapers to beat him for everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.
He blamed the criticism, for sure.
But he did not silence his critics.
In 1783, Washington said, “Freedom of speech can be taken away—and, dumb and mute, we are led like sheep to slaughter.”
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan’s employees have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And so the American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a backlash with "Na, and?"
“It’s just Facebook,” many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important if it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is amazingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the nation’s 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary heathead.
He has shown a firm hand in leading his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very skillful at using Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and debuting his hairless head on his side after chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking people coming to the governor’s side — which is a public forum that is called official and paid by employees with public tax dollars — is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan’s spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor’s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it’s too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people swinging the whip online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who talk to their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profane.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not full of hatred, but she asked for hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the comments section of the news broadcast "The Post".
“I also don’t appreciate this idea if a number of people take a stand on the same issue, then they are ignored by some rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens.”
What the governor’s staff called a “concentrated spam attack” would probably call others “prescribing.”
The Facebook era makes it easy to crop a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past if you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or to arrest and silence protesters.
This is exactly what is happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for insulting Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones on this issue fell last week in Virginia.
Loudoun County's Chairman of the Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banished a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of affordable Porto had a similar effect as the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letterwriters struck on his lead.
Even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions down.
Petitions that criticized his position on the Amity Treaty, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project.
But he did not silence her.
Freedom of speech, differences of opinion and discourse form the basis of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for comfort at the Renaissance Club
Former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for home comfort in the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who led next door in Archerfield links to the final round before losing to Paul Eales, is linked to the new venue and acts as tournament ambassador on behalf of the club’s founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
“I’ve seen the Renaissance Club being built, and we see how it achieved its fame with this event,” Rafferty said.
“Players will see this course from its best side, it is in great condition.
Jerry did a great job fixing this place.
He is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course.”
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
“That feels really special,” said the Southport-based player.
"I couldn't defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the program the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate."
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday earlier this year, returns to action on home soil.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
“It always means a little more when you play at home,” said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
“You want to do well, but you also feel that extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I am happy with how it has gone so far.”
With the trio on the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots in the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Less lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking
Over the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died from lung cancer due to passive smoking.
Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) come to this conclusion in a study.
“According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoking,” said study leader Heiko Becher.
By comparison, he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994.
At that time, there were 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany.
The study was published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Home connections prove to be very complex
The construction works on Villinger Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e are in full swing and "are somewhat in time", according to the head of the construction yard Fred Heinze.
In the area of house connections, the situation is more complicated than suspected, as there is much hiding in the underground, which is not noted in the plans.
Traffic, which repeatedly hinders the construction work, is a major problem for the Stumpp construction team.
“The ignorance of drivers in front of red traffic lights and barrier grilles is already enormous,” Heinze reports.
The road is closed and only the buses are allowed to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days have been pretty exhausting.
But luckily, our friend Fritz Matt provided us with cool mineral water,” says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in the Indonesian Gold Country
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she does not use a stove.
They rarely even use a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai regency in the restless Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - locally referred to as "nota" - directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is removed with eager, unwashed hands and swallowed.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also does her daily work, such as washing clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband’s four wives, no fields were assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are soldiers here.
“No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.,” she says.
It is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was admitted in Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when only 1,026 elders were to vote in front of the occupying forces by a public hand survey.
An existing movement that stirred for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea comprising the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is desolate. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour drive by car.
There is no public transport.
The city with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, and of corrugated roofs converted into various yellow-brown tones by rust.
Very few Indonesians have made their journey here, let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans venerated a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes as well.
“We weren’t used to wearing these clothes,” says Degei, pointing to her lively, hand-woven turban, dark shirt and bright skirt.
“In the past, we only had leaves on our bodies.”
Papua is Indonesia’s poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst rates of child mortality and literacy in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia’s gold country.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport produced $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has wood resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of misery for the Papuans, ensuring that Indonesia’s powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 New York Times study reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden goose and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua’s tribal highlands in the 1970s became genocide according to the Asia-Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
“We will lose everything,” says a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which includes reports of atrocities of the previous year, such as unlawful executions and torture – rape and electric shocks are particularly popular, according to another report – and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It’s difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week,” says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have intensified as Papua’s resources bring inflows of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese Warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting to stay here.
“Immigrants have started selling chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local Papuans,” explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital of Jayapura to work.
"It cost the native Papua - the Mama-Mama [the women] of Papua - their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised to address the inequalities and legal violations in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua little has changed, and today the locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
In fact, Paniai suffered a low point just two months after Jokowi’s inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were out singing Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took offense at her tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and beat the group with their rifle pistons, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was hit so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - running in circles and imitating a bird song - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters began to throw stones at police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, a command was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," according to an official document from TIME, which was not released to local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the menacing danger and called for rest and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was listening in the mood.
“When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist,” he said TIME on the porch of his colorfully painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn’t know who fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was crowded, lots of shots were fired," he adds.
The local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was," said John, who, like many Indonesians, bears only one name, TIME in a dark mood.
"I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him."
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" their station because it was attacked.
"We need to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua Police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
“It’s about life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many others injured.
The news of the killings came 'filtered' to Jakarta only the following day.
For three weeks, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura, expressing sympathy for the families of the victims and vowing to address the historical ills in Papua.
“I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future,” he said.
In October 2016, Minister of Security Wiranto said he was setting up an out-of-court mechanism to resolve historic human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
"Most injuries occurred long ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed to address these violations, but there are processes that need to be passed," he said.
Then Wiranto made a withdrawal when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5 and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, “everything is regulated by law,” he said.
Wiranto, whom the UN has accused of “crimes against humanity” demanding more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor’s bloody 1999 independence vote, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with grim incredulity.
“I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress,” says John.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
“I’m scared,” he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, I'm afraid of being shot."
His brother Yacobus reiterated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims.
“After I buried the bodies, the military was looking for me,” he says.
The shootings did not stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in Paniai's neighborhood of Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Excited villagers protested in front of the company’s location office.
Police said villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killing one.
“We were so panicked, we’re afraid there will be revenge,” says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here, according to TIME.
“I hid in my house for two days.”
The Deiyai Parliament has called on the involved officers to be held accountable and to withdraw the mobile brigade of the police from the area.
Paniai has always been a source of unrest for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the discontent of the tribesmen Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papua by inciting sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
In response, in recent years, thousands of people have been arrested in Paniai and arbitrarily taken into custody, under the pretext of "securing national sovereignty".
Some never show up again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction.
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
The people here grow everything they eat: mainly nuts and fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the job of women, who can each work four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten notes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the native Papuans and the new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and more prosperous migrants.
Papuans rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.
“The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here,” says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on the reporting of international media remain strained.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua due to a lack of coordination with related institutions, although they were given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi’s campaign’s promises to lift the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's troubled easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and a black list," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to the immediate neighbors of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "different and widespread violations" in Papua including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir denied the group’s allegations and told journalists in Jakarta: “In Indonesia, there is still a democratic system, and there is free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence for human rights cases.”
The local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and pressed him "We want freedom", according to a source who also attended the meeting, but wanted to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papuans say they will probably not vote for Jokowi again.
“Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shootings,” said Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papuans, consider their voice for Jokowi to be a "debt" that he has to repay.
“They don’t need money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out one last symbolic act of defiance: the victim’s body was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station.
They know that they may never receive justice, but at least they do not let those responsible forget their crimes.
“A member of our family was killed,” Yacobus says with his head lowered.
"What else can we do?"
Fire capture Dubai's 'torch' skyscraper for the second time
A fire found its way through one of the world’s tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 337-metre-high, 79-story building.
It is the second fire that sweeps through the high-rise building in just two years, which is accidentally called the torch tower.
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word on the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and screaming people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," a resident who gave his name as George told Reuters.
Dubai’s civil protection authorities said the units of firefighting at 4.00 a.m. local time (00.00 a.m. GMT) extinguished the fire and cooled the building.
The government said it is working on providing accommodation for those affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from the cladding, the exterior cladding for decoration or insulation.
In the UK, police said they believe that the plates’ system of insulation and cladding at the London Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died.
No Davis Cup Reform: Continue Best-of-five
The President of the International Tennis Association (ITF) has fallen through with his great Davis Cup Cup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup single only on two winning sets was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The five-set classics, which are often very long, but also highly appreciated for this reason, are thus preserved to the traditional application.
63.54 percent of the member states voted in favour of the reform, so the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was barely missed.
"We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions,” Haggerty said.
They will continue to work to improve the job.
Not even for the vote had come after many objections already before the proposal to perform the final in a neutral place.
New from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details: so the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host right in the first round in the following year.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, the training places, etc. requirements will be facilitated and players will have to complete less official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 in 5 U.S. travelers put banned items on the plane, a survey finds
A survey among air passengers found that more than 20 percent deliberately or unconsciously smuggled prohibited items past the U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who entered the plane while carrying accidentally banned knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 percent said they had discovered late that they had mistakenly traveled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people — conducted by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. — also found that younger travelers were more likely to violate the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared to less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items that were deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted to knowingly carrying objects with blades through security control, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the plane.
The company said it had surveyed travelers across the country to find out how many inadvertently smuggled goods had been brought through airport security and how many had intentionally done so.
It’s no surprise that the people who carry the most contraband – knowingly or unknowingly – through security were the ones who fly the most.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are a bit complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure what liquids they can take with them or how much of it.
So it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids confiscated by the TSA are prohibited.
For a while, people thought the TSA might view books as contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk Doesn't Care: Tens of Thousands of Tesla Customers Cancel Order
Elon Musk is pleased to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
In doing so, he has so far ruled out that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever triumphant figures on revenue increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed for the first time a different, less brilliant number when announcing the latest quarterly balance sheet: the cancellations of the new mass market model 3.
In recent months, Musk has frequently advertised the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, the delivery of which is just beginning.
Musk admits: 63,000 of the 518,000 pre-orders have already been withdrawn.
Critics had repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In the event of a cancellation, Tesla will pay back the $1,000 (US$1000 in the U.S. and <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 in the UK) "reservation deposit" in full.
Currently, 455,000 such non-binding reservations are in place, Musk admitted in a conference call with analysts.
However, the Tesla CEO does not believe that cancelling around 12 percent of all orders could be a problem.
His argument: The challenge of ambitious growth goals is not in demand, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018, it will be – all models combined – 500,000, a million in 2020.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, 1800 reservations are currently made per day.
Those who order a "Model 3" today can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production lines, which have never been tested in practice, without major interruptions with maximum capacity.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are major delays, then the non-binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in crowds.
EPA chief Pruitt withdraws due to delaying Obama-era rules to reduce emissions
One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, took back his previous decision to delay the implementation of Obama-era rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the action brought against his previous position in a federal appeals court.
It is a deadline that came on October 1 for states to comply with the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering with local decisions or hindering economic growth".
Pruitt, who had been Oklahoma State Attorney for a long time before he was appointed by President Donald Trump, was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly gone on to block or delay regulations that oppose the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry.
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for Pruitt’s regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his reversal of ozone standards simply reinforces the EPA’s willingness to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPO has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited for it to be charged by activist groups and others, and in an agreement to set the deadline for implementation," Pruitt said, who sued the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job.
“We don’t believe in regulation through court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the law and the authority that it gives us."
However, the EPA’s statement stated that Pruitt will at some point use his “power of delay and all other legally available powers” to ensure that the rules are “based on sound policies and the best available information.”
The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive recast of the ozone rules.
A bill approved last month is expected to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that the EPA had sued this week, said the group intended to maintain legal pressure.
“The EPO’s reversal – according to our lawsuits – is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog flowing into their communities,” Schneiderman said.
New York in this case joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone occurs when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people, and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered over Pruitt’s surprising change of course.
“It’s worrying how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe,” said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the Trump administration's ideological crusade to offer themselves to environmental polluters and their special interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a Serenade on Sunday, 16 July, at 4.30 p.m.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and supporters of Tumlingen their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It is a unique village gem".
In 1267, St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württemberger Urkundenbuch: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church on it to Tumlingen and the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 marks of silver.
According to the wording of the document, on the Tumlinger Berg, besides the former parish church, there was also a royal court, to which the church or patronage belonged, and not vice versa.
People lived there too.
As can be seen from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt of 1858, next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which can be seen today in the local image of Tumlingen, the "mountain" was the third, the ruling settlement center of the village.
Old maps from the period around 1600 underpin these historical circumstances.
The patronage law arose from the early medieval eigenkirchen law.
A gentleman who built, equipped, and occupied a church with a priest continued to own this church and was able to inherit this own church.
This included the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two collapsed on Christmas 1673.
The newly acquired bell then first sounded in 1692, but had to be delivered later in World War II in 1942.
During the Thirty Years' War (1616-1648), the windows were smashed and the bell ropes were stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823, the cemetery was expanded and the Hilarius Church was demolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
In the New Year’s Eve of 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was demolished.
Only the tower dwarf that still exists today was preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "Schaffigen Retirers" as successors of Dieter Dockhorn maintain the Hilarius plant.
As organizers, Tumlingen’s friends and supporters invite you to the sixth Serenade on Sunday, 16 July at the old cemetery to St. Hilariuskapelle.
This is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with word contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local leader Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.
Admission is from 3:30 p.m.
To the end of the Serenade, a drink takes place in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest," the organizers exhibit the fantastic views.
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to receive the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
Tumlingen’s friends and supporters feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini affirms.
Association wants to have approval of wind turbines checked
"Boisheim resists" sees no legal prerequisite for the construction and has therefore turned to the Landrat.
The association "Boisheim resists" has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was unlawful.
The association argues that at the time of the approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette no wind power plants could have been approved, since at the time in Viersen only a wind power concentration zone existed at the city border in Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city area.
Such zones are intended to prevent the "sparing" of the landscape.
The city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by changing the land use plan - but the district government had not approved Düsseldorf, due to a form failure.
"Due to the lack of planning requirements, the granted permit decision is still illegal and therefore also withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim resists".
Current state of affairs: Before the summer break, the city council has again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; a permit from the district government is still pending.
Recognizing: "This excludes the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines at this point."
The circle confirms the receipt of the request.
"The corresponding letters have been received by the district of Viersen since last week," a spokesman said.
The circle takes them for the occasion to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not expected to stop the procedure.
With regard to ongoing proceedings at the administrative court, the circle did not want to comment on the content of the argument of the association "Boisheim resists".
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, is planning the construction of four 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area on the Boisheimer Nette.
Last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had already concluded leases with the owner of the approximately 65-hectare site.
With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity demand of around 11,400 households is to be covered – that is about one fifth of the electricity demand of all four-family households.
The New Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersens City Council gave a green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a participation in a wind power plant in <0xC3><0x9C>bach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.
Car and Tractor Crash Together: Woman Dies in Terrible Accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning around 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was fatally injured.
Two other people were slightly injured.
The highway was closed for hours.
According to police reports, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich drove her car as part of the accompanied driving with her 53-year-old mother as a companion on the L 333 towards Bogel.
City and dealer planning "home shopping" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region will rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The business association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to entice the residents to shop in the city centre.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "home shopping" weekend is intended to raise awareness of what offers the city has to offer away from the usual supermarket goods.
It is therefore planned to have a market with regional suppliers, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies should present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops in the city centre are supposed to invite you to "Mitternachts-Shoppen".
The action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the nearby region.
In preparation are commercials on the radio, an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend, according to Christian König.
The city administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Thus, the trade association and the city go to another stage of the project "Attractive Downtown".
This includes new offers such as the first "Active Day" to the Fountain Festival, including sales open Sunday, discussions with all the traders and hosts to encourage them to participate actively.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potentials are to be re-opened or re-opened.
This includes spa guests and tourists.
But also many locals would have lost sight of downtown shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to contribute to invigorating the city centre – up to landlords, the businesses of the whole city and clubs.
It was appropriate to use a network to overcome the lethargy, which had spread in part, King had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, said that Germany’s third “home shopping” day, for the first time, will involve five Thuringian cities.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should “advertise the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance for the common good of our cities,” Streich said.
The action under the leadership of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his/her own direct environment with his/her buying behaviour.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at U.S. school
During construction, there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Minneapolis, two people were killed and nine others were injured, some of them heavy.
According to the fire department, another injured person was in critical condition on Wednesday (local time).
One person died when part of a school building collapsed during the explosion.
A missing man was also later rescued.
The dead were employees of the school.
As a cause of unhappiness, the authorities suspected working on a gas pipeline.
During the holiday season, few people stayed in the building of the Minnehaha Academy.
Trump put pressure on Mexico for paying the border wall after leaked transcripts of phone calls
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called on Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop publicly saying he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The president of the United States insulted him because he had publicly denounced the wall, according to reports he told him, "You can't tell the press."
Trump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States, and vowed to let Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the U.S. was to take over refugees who emigrated to Australia was “ridiculous,” “my” and “stupid,” and that the existence of the trade that was mediated by the Obama administration would make him look like a “dept” after he proposed a ban on resettlement of refugees to the U.S.
Mr. Trump ended the call after saying to Mr. Turnbull, “This is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day.”
Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Relaunch Racist Lynch Act as Call for Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rallied to Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men emerged with guns to block his way.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle strip suit - took a long train on his cigar and looked through the windshield in a test.
Inside, the inmates floated in fear.
"We want this n--r Roger!" cried the man.
"Get him out of the car!"
Crying tore the silence when a young black man was torn from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene played on July 22 is just a retelling.
But when a sling is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost all in the audience emit very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have come back to Moore's Ford Bridge to emulate the night when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with murder.
“It’s truly unbelievable that in all these years no one has been arrested — even though we see them in our communities, though we know who they are,” said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the posturing.
“It’s a stain on a story, but it’s a burden to our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of the state of Georgia and a lifelong civil rights activist.
For him, the reenactment serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want termination, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need to get justice," he said.
“We cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice.”
A court physician placed a bedcloth over the body of one of the victims of the Moore Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching process.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have remained free for decades, civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lynch actions across the city was always known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court decision allowed the black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in the pre-election campaign in the summer.
About the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black farmer Roger Malcom, a white landowner, Barnett Hester, stood down during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in the city was that Hester had slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was carrying was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, the FBI said.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
But when they got out of prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," an FBI report concludes.
"It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local law enforcement that not only involved in the murders, eliminated evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."
Brooks puts it even more concisely.
“It was an electoral campaign,” he said.
They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you register and if you vote, this will happen to you here."
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual re-enactment of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murder.
Their portrayal is vivid, gripping, and is grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It’s hard to watch, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that’s the point.
“We don’t want to talk about the lynching, because then we are confronted with its ugliness in all of us,” she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've been through."
The rehearsals for this year’s production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors – a dozen whites and the rest blacks – pushed themselves into a room and listened as Greene started a well-recorded overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's co-director.
He has been playing the role of chief clan member for years, but he said the role will never be easier.
“I feel dirty because I’m not like that,” Marbaugh said.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to go back to those times."
On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The play begins with Malcom screaming at Hester and harassing him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n -- he, get away from my property!"
Rascona responds to the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?" asked Rascona.
He is alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still gibberish.
"I just don't think white people said 'n--he' at the time."
"But," joked one of the other black actors.
"You just have to hit the hard 'R.'."
And that’s where the energy in the room shifts, a sense of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and emphatically.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots, and then silence.
A woman dressed in a mourning dress stands over the actor's corpse and performs Billie Holidays' lamenting praise "Strange Fruit".
Your voice breaks every second word.
About a hundred meters behind, a group of about four dozen spectators wipes out sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple has arrived from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many just coming down the street.
They’ve all experienced Georgia’s oppressive humidity for almost eight hours as Brooks takes them on a pilgrimage to the graves of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
To this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now that you’re on the same land where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels spooky.
When the last notes of the song finish, Greene invites the crowd to get closer and inspect the body name.
Children sit on their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"You're not really dead," murmurs a little boy, as if he wanted to remember it.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the lynch rope and wipe off their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then breaks into their arms crying, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him.
“It’s okay,” one of the women whispered.
“We know it’s not in your heart.
You did it for a reason.”
Later, the audience joins up with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta chatted excitedly about the re-enactment with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that left the performance feeling.
“It’s hard to hear these terrible words and actions... coming from people who look like you and do that because they look like you,” she said.
"What this really does to me makes me believe that the lynching is still going on," she added, "today it's just called police shooting."
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks’s court holds at his table, he eats and recalls civil rights.
He said he has already started planning the performance next year.
“The posturing is inspiring in some ways, because it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it’s also a moment of learning,” he said.
“If we don’t learn from it, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their own history, those who do not know their own history, are doomed to repeat it."
"Götterd<0xC3><0xA4>mmerung" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner’s monumental work, director Frank Castorf sets out on a colorful, frivolous production in front of a gigantic, six-story setting.
The revolving stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows a shady street corner, including the remnants of the Wall and Dönerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste und Elaste" logo from GDR-zeiten or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes vintage car parked in which the Rheindöchter pose as rockergirls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf's leitmotif - money, power and greed - which moves through his "ring" staging.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully as already in the "Rheingold".
Kess seduces Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), pulls a body into the trunk in Hollywood manner and gives the Krawallo clique.
Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully nasty garden that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he kills Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) must also believe in it.
The audience thanked the ensemble with strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski are celebrated in a stormy manner, modestly bowing their hands to the Merkel-Route.
There is great applause for the Festspielorchester, which is shown on stage for the first time - in the face of the great heat again in casual casual wear.
The performance of Frank Castorf and his directorial team was eagerly anticipated.
Had he still had to have a valid pipe concert over him in 2013, there were five years later great cheers in which the occasional "buh" calls went down.
Festival director Katharina Wagner may have been happy about it.
“You notice that the audience has grown in some way with the ‘ring’,” she had said just before the performance of the dpa.
The audience not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it was also an understanding of its point of view.
I draw a positive summary.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
They work in several places during their volunteer year.
Where everywhere?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
I also worked at school all day long.
How are your experiences with it?
Quantity: It is a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You are now 26 years old, so a late-career volunteer.
How's that coming?
Q: I did high school.
And then a civil engineering degree, let’s say, successfully canceled.
I realized for myself that it’s wrong for me and I want to do something different, work with people.
And then I asked myself, what are you doing?
Do a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it really is on site, at the focal point maybe too.
And was it like that?
Quantity: I have collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in the social sciences in the winter semester.
I am going to study dual, probably do a social worker training at the Youth Office Herne and study in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.
Isn’t it a bit unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It always depends on where you make your FSJ.
You can do it from retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
With me it was very varied.
I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly what irritated me.
I was able to recognize my own strengths and see how it really goes.
Unlike in civil engineering studies?
Quantity: Well, this is not about calculating statics.
You always have other people in front of you, who each have a completely different story behind them.
Whether a refugee, whether a young person who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have any contact fears?
Q: I'm not the guy for that.
It’s an area that gives you a lot.
Much love, lots of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but that’s how life is.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividends to revive business
Pearson said Friday it will cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent as another restructuring program is launched to overcome the pressure the company is facing.
The job cut, which Director General John Fallon announced mainly for the end of 2018 and early 2019, comes in addition to his previous restructuring, in which already 4,000 jobs were lost.
In May, Pearson announced a <0xC2><0xA3>300 million ($394 million) cost-cutting plan in a third cost-cutting program to revitalize a business hit by the fast-paced step toward digital learning.
The company, which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said the outlook for the fiscal year remained unchanged after it achieved a 1 percent increase to <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed a NATO soldier and injured several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and one interpreter were injured, NATO said in a statement.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians also died in the incident in the district of Qarabagh.
The bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has committed this month - on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A NATO statement said the explosion occurred on Thursday evening when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by an "improvised explosive device carried by persons".
The statement states that all the injured are in a stable condition and are being treated in the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airport.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which about 20% in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out this attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the country's deadliest militant attack since U.S.-led troops forced the Taliban out of power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops supporting military and police forces in the country.
Correspondents say that the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government, its policies and, in particular, in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay Smog rule after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has lifted a decision to delay regulation of Obama’s government, stating that states are required to curb smog-causing emissions, a day after 15 states sued the agency for the move.
The EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so-called “Ozone Regulations 2015” and said it is demonstrating the agency’s commitment to working with states.
“We believe in the dialogue with and that we are responding to our state partners,” said EPA chief executive Scott Pruitt in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the EPA’s intention to delay the ozone regulations – in which pollutant emissions are to be measured in a part of the country to determine where cuts need to be made to meet stricter air quality standards – by one year to October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, along with the district of Colombia, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday, saying the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump’s government has tried to pull back a wide range of environmental burdens imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda to boost economic growth, Trump said.
However, efforts have sparked the backlash of Democrats and conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of larger emissions on public health.
The EPA’s website says that inhaling air that contains ozone “can reduce lung function and increase breathing symptoms” such as asthma.
Community Council wants community space
In the end, the decision was clear: with two opposing votes, the municipal council of Fluorn-Winzeln decides to set up a common room in the future senior housing facility.
Before the discussion, there is important information: the purchase contract for the missing property is signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will still take some time for the area previously owned by the church community to be owned by the municipality, there is now no planning impediment to the project to be voted on by a private investor.
For this there is a discussion on a common area.
One of the two investors, who are still in the boat, has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, he would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjoining terrace with at least 70 square meters of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council are committed to providing such a common space not only as a meeting place for the residents of the senior housing, but openly into the municipality.
As an example, the word of the “stick café” made the round.
The decision, which was already decided last autumn by the provision of funds for the current budget, will be welcomed by means of funding.
The building is located in the renovation area.
The establishment of a common space would be eligible, according to Tjaden, with 60 per cent of 30 per cent.
In order to signal to the investor that he does not want to throw a knot between his legs in this respect, the resolution provides that both saddle--which is based on the environment--and a pull-up roof--which reduces the height of the rope and makes the construction more economical--would be possible.
Needless to say, not only does Wilfried Sohmer mean this addition.
If it helps, he'll pass the body by unanimity.
It is not so easy for the common room.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many of her own buildings, with which one does not get along so well, for now one leans out of the window at the common room, she says, "I'm working hard with it".
Yvonne Staiger definitely speaks out for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation.
It sees behind it a covert subsidy to anyway assets or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because with the acquisition of the land one does not give a subsidy, but gets a real counter-value, which can be marketed in case of doubt, is the counter-speech.
Staiger's request to split the resolution accordingly finds three proponents.
In the original programme, which Stefan Haller sums up as follows: "If we make the decision this way, we are taking a giant step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure".
Collision by car: biker is thrown on the road
On the road, an 82-year-old cyclist was caught by a car in Garath on Wednesday and seriously injured.
As the police said, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been on the road from Hilden at 12.20 a.m. with his bicycle on the cycle path of the Schwarzer Weg road.
The senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the street Am Buchholzer Busch.
A driver driving in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfelder went on the road, he apparently did not pay attention to the traffic.
He collided with a car driving a 66-year-old Hilden woman.
The man was thrown on the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital with a rescue car.
FC Bayern Munich to give up David Alaba and Thiago at the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup takes place without him: David Alaba has to let the match against Dortmund suck.
FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory match of the new season with personnel concerns.
Seven pros are missing the title defender in the Supercup against the cup winner.
The personal concerns of the German football-record champion Bayern Munich are getting bigger and bigger before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 a.m./ZDF and Eurosport) at the cup winner Borussia Dortmund.
Coach Carlo Ancelotti must also give up David Alaba in the duel with the BVB.
The Italian confirmed this on Friday.
In addition, the Munichers Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
For the five defeats in the past six Test matches, Ancelotti has blamed the physical condition and lack of balance in his team’s play.
“We know we’re not in the best physical condition,” Ancelotti said, adding: “The most important point is the balance in the team.
It wasn’t good at the last time.”
However, the 58-year-old believes in a performance increase in the first official mandatory game of the season.
“Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently,” said Ancelotti, who expects a “severe, intense game.”
The duel of the two German football heavyweights captivates the fans.
The match is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Walk from star to star in the resin
In the Harz, the first "star path" is to be created nationwide.
The association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg is planning this.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star trail" meets the information needs of many resin visitors, it said.
It connects nature, science, movement and athletic performance.
The members want to set up panels along the planned route and inform them about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "well-accessible installations in five to six locations" in Oberharz.
St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegei<0xC3><0x9F> and Sieber could be considered.
The information on the panels is to be supplemented via the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network reception plays a role in the location selection.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the star path Zug is to be extended by train.
“On the star path, the viewers learn a lot of knowledge, for example about the physics of the individual stars,” the association explained.
In addition, they learned why stars have different colors or why one star is brighter than another, although it is much further away.
It also conveys the constellation in which a selected star is located and when it is best seen.
Since 2014, the association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg, the highest observatory in northern Germany.
The location in the heart of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation.
From there, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda Galaxy can often be clearly seen with the naked eye.
Since 2003, there has been something similar in the university city on the initiative of the funding association Planetarium Göttingen, such as the planned Sternenwerg - the planetary path.
Starting in front of Gebhard's hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path with its steles leads up to the Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "extraterrestrial" location in Diemarden (community of equals) with the planet Sedna.
The stelae with the individual planets - including the Pluto degraded to the dwarf planet at the end point - are located exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The Earth shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the exact 75 meters away sun measures 70 centimetres.
The entire distance of the planetary path is about four kilometers.
While the light from the sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to the stele with Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in space.
The march to the next fixed star, however, would take another half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future below <0xC2><0xA3>147, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, went down the hallway to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super featherweight champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How are you, Champion?
I wish you good luck."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
When the couple posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the “perfect order of magnitude.”
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
"I've risen to 140 pounds for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to come down to lightweight.
And he has to move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
This is what the fans demand.
Let’s give it to them.”
Lomachenko agreed.
“Boxing needs this fight.”
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko will have to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) who also has an interest in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight in the forum on September 23.
“This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all the fans have asked for it,” Garcia said, and later openly expressed himself fighting at the network that offers the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other name can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever you're ready..."
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as “a huge fighter,” and he may be participating in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinks the three-fight champion from Riverside looks "very slow, I'm sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-out".
Garcia said the focus was to show punch strength, then boxing.
They both said they could feel the momentum that was building up for their own struggle.
“This is the fight that needs to be fought.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I’m more than happy to work on it,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It will be a great fight.”
Four injured after tire puncture
In an accident on the A7, four people were injured on Thursday afternoon.
After the first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at around 4.30 a.m. just before the market wide connection point, probably after a tire-placer.
The car slid to the right into the embankment, where it slid over and then remained on the roof in the green stripe.
The four inmates, two adults and two children, were seriously injured in the accident.
During the first care of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was blocked for about an hour towards the north, after which traffic on the left lane could be routed past the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Third chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2:2 start of the season against Braunschweig that the optimization of the defensive formation will bring points into Aue.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first season match, and with the result, the two goals would not have been 2-2 against Braunschweig.
“These were two opposing goals too much, and we have to be even more careful in Aue,” says Fortuna Düsseldorf’s defensive player.
In the Erzgebirge, the triangle is also to be further optimized.
And a goal after a free kick, the Fortunes no longer want to catch up.
"For the future, no one will stand next to Michael (Rensing) on the line."
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be better off even after the experience in preparing with the three chain than with the four chain.
"I still don't know how we're going to act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause, "because we have players who can build well at the half-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gie<0xC3><0x9F>elmann just in the triangle," Hoffmann said.
"It's a prerequisite, but that we harmonize even better and we don't make so many playing mistakes in the build-up."
Of course, Hoffmann also travels to Aue to win the game.
“Whether you can talk about a failed start after a draw, you don’t know.
“The performance could be okay,” Hoffmann said.
"But if we can stand with four points on Sunday and focus on the cup, we will certainly be able to talk about a decent start to the season."
His coach didn’t want to know.
"I don't judge the start of the season until after six to eight days of play," said Friedhelm Funkel, who doesn't want to talk about an advantage over Aue, just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely because of a bad weather.
“Now they can almost start the season with a home game,” said Funkel and Hoffmann, believing that players from Aue might even be a little fresher, as they don’t have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a rising favorite in the bones.
“But they don’t know as 100 percent where they are at the moment,” said Fortuna’s interior defender.
Although the guests from the Rhineland go as an easy favorite on Sunday to the meeting in the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"The fact that we're sweeping them away just because we're entitled to come under the first six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose record is quite positive in just one defeat against Aue from nine games.
“There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the start,” explains Fortuna’s head coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and haughty".
And so Funkel does not want to experience his players on Sunday in any way.
New Results of Swedish Asylum Age Assessment Tests Released
Recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the tested individuals are over the age of 18. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Agency for Forensic Medicine (R<0xC3><0xA4>ttsmedicinalverket) has started conducting the tests last year.
During the asylum process, they should make the assessment of the age more precise after the Swedish Migration Agency was criticized for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years of age or older."
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under the age of 18".
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent over the past few months.
“We don’t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are pretty constant,” he told The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases in which the person has been assessed as over 18 years of age does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said there were 442 cases that “propose that the investigated person is 18 years of age or older.”
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly stated that she would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRIs of knee joints are made, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of humans to see if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
“I had reason to think about it, and I don’t think the type of measurement should be used.
Assessing biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it for sure, we shouldn't pretend we could," he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "Generally speaking, you can say that the risk of judging a child wrong as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is when the person is just under 18, in this case, this is about 10 percent."
Full in the Plan
The work on the three bridges of Landstra<0xC3><0x9F>e 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton concrete section was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We're very good at the time, it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Department of Road and Transport at the Freiburg Government Bureau.
In April, the work began at the same time on all three bridges in need of renovation between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The end of construction is planned for October and it is easy to be sure that the schedule will be adhered to.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a vaulted concrete arched bridge covered with red sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has come in years.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, or 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received a bridge cap 1,30 meters wide and seven tons heavy on Wednesday morning on the north side.
This is an edge attachment, which is also used as an operating path.
On Friday, a 2.20-metre-wide bridge cap will be used on the southern part of the bridge.
Then the pedestrian path should run on it.
The special thing is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already provided with the patented bridge caps.
The laying of pipes through the building in Lauterbach has required a special sense of touch.
Because there is also a fiber optic cable that many companies are connected to.
Residents were informed about the project in advance of the work by handbills.
In addition, fish and crabs had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the construction yard building and the collector's pond in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated by a traffic light in one lane.
For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach entrance, the road is completely blocked in the area of the bridge at the level of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden".
The total cost of the three bridge renovations is EUR 700 000.
The whole thing is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bunter Protest at German Potato Salad
It doesn’t happen so often that parties pull together, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to put under a hat.
The parties represented in Vulkaneifel (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, Left) are part of a broad alliance, which on that day shows a peaceful flag, because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell invites the "great campaign launch" according to the poster.
And well-known names come to the fore - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland is the top duo for the Bundestag election on 24 September, and the deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are already on site hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD teachers, but to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colorful".
Originally, the city picnic was planned under the motto "Everyone at a table" on Brunnenplatz, but now takes place in the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus right in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle.
A colorful picture that is available there.
And what Christa Karoli, chairman of the Forums A World and one of the leading organizers, really rejoices: "Toll how many people have come together here".
There is music and a lot of food, including an “German potato salad, which the AfD could also easily eat,” says the woman who brought him.
The police have ordered many officers to Gerolstein, it shows presence especially at the station, which is only a few meters away from the venues.
How did the AfD get to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reports that he has been working on such an event and has received the award.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had first asked in Daun, but there was a rejection because there were not enough parking spaces because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes.
Now the Rondell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a nice event here".
Looking at the event on the Rondell forecourt, he says: "This is the good law of the people, the main thing, it remains peaceful".
Around 8 p.m. a band provides entertainment at the Rondellvorplatz, where various speakers in the Stadthalle, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge, will be present.
In the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix von Storch to give their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officers had a quiet evening.
The AfD event takes a little more than an hour, the guests in the front square have a longer breath, but also there is a need to clean up shortly after 9 pm.
The police can break down - no special events.
trombone meets trumpet
A rehearsal with the Wolfacher trombonist Frederic Belli will take place in the series Haslacher Klosterkonzerte tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 pm in the Klosterkirche.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or even "Balkanfolklore" meets a classical German education with roots in wind music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in top European orchestras.
For example, Petkov is a solo trumpeter at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is a solo composer of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries on their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new garment, Daniel Schnyder's "Weltmusik" combines with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by jazzecho award winner Nils Wogram, classics, jazz and free play blend into a fascinating overall work of art.
This core piece of the program was premiered this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more: The Haslacher Klosterkirche with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
“Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything," Kristen Stewart said openly about her bisexuality.
"Once I bite into grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh that was cool, what's next?'"
The Hollywood star's best-known relationship was that of her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who eventually went bitterly apart.
Despite all this, the brunette actress assures the Harper's Bazaar magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I dated.
Or do you think I would have played it?”
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I've always lived dualism and seriously believed in it.
It has never confused or hindered me.
I just never liked not being taken seriously.”
According to "Bang Showbiz", she suffered particularly from this, but during school time, when she preferred to dress like a bub: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I would look like a boy.
I felt really attacked, frightened and ashamed.
Now I look back and think to myself, ‘Girl, be proud of you!’”
Especially to the public, they don’t like to explain their love life: “People expect you to behave in a certain way and that upsets me.
And maybe some call me ungrateful, but I don’t like having to justify myself in front of the whole public.”
The Governor of West Virginia announces that he will change the party
The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Trump that he will change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have distanced themselves from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thought ... today I will tell you as residents of West Virginia, I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor."
The rally broke out in jubilation.
“Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans,” Justice added.
“As a coach, I would say it’s time to play another game.”
Mr. Trump previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not approve Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and inherited a coal business from his father.
It is worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening, saying: “Governor Justice’s party change is another blow to a Democratic party that would hinder us rather than work to make our country great again.”
“With only 15 governments and the control of the fewest legislative bodies in history, Governor Justice’s announcement is only the last rejection of a party that is without leadership from top to bottom and is unable to find a positive, unifying message,” RNC chairman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Coe praises "honest" Russian apology for doping scandal
The world’s head of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised Thursday what he described as a blatant apology from Russia for a doping scandal, but he reiterated that it was not the time for the country to be reinstated into the sport.
Russia's athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country's expulsion from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all athletes who were snatched away gold and silver medals at competitions".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
“I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation,” IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The entire Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned."
Coe said he was also “excited” that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the Task Force's recommendations that this is not the time to reinstate Russia," Coe said.
“We need to do everything in the next few months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the corrupt system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Athletics Championships, starting in London on Friday, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for a reset.
Drug testing is still inadequate and banned trainers are still working freely, he told reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Grief for Soldiers Crashed in Mali
At a funeral in North Hessian Fritzlar, about 1,000 people of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali have thought.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures.
Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing about the yet unexplained crash case.
However, she described the two killed pilots as "experts in their field".
"We bow to this highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she said.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Chief of Staff from North Hesse were killed Wednesday, a week ago in West African Mali.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and brought to Fritzlar Cathedral St. Peter on Thursday accompanied by a death watch of the Bundeswehr.
At noon, only the members of the church said goodbye.
Afterwards, the funeral began in the circle of the family, close friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr as well as politics.
Among them were Hessen's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the Inspector General of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
The mourners laid down roses, the relatives stood arm in arm to the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
Defense Minister von der Leyen described the soldiers killed as "highly decorated" and in-service experience.
The chief of staff helped build the flight operations of the Tiger fighter helicopter in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, also stated: "If this crew could not turn the crash away, then no one would have been able to do so."
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show Minister von der Leyen: the operation was dangerous.
But he is also of high importance “for a country from which we are separated only by two states,” she said.
After the funeral, the coffins were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they are buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife
The husband of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
The royal family said this on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn N<0xC3><0xB8>rgaard already produced a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with her husband’s decision, the statement said.
Where Prince Henrik is buried is still unclear.
However, he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a hell of it that he was not happy with his title.
After the accession of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016 he retired and also took the title "Prince's Meal".
Since Henrik did not receive the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he did not consider himself equal to his wife - even after his death, Lene Balleby, the chief speaker of the Danish royal family, explained.
Where the last resting place of the 83-year-old will ultimately be is still unclear.
However, he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he has worked for in the last 50 years.
Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, the son of a French noble family, met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked at the Thames in the French Embassy.
During his later wife's frequenting of the people's expressions of sympathy, Prince Henrik had a difficult position with the Danes in his almost 50-year reign.
In an autobiography, Henrik commented about the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knit socks, Citro<0xC3><0xAB>n instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco, who in this country had the reputation of being the brand of socially critical intellectuals, I couldn’t hope for for forbearance.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed.
There were two mistakes!”
Prime Minister Weil wants rapid re-election
CDU and FDP ahead of possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony’s Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is after the loss of the red-green government majority for a quick re-election of the Landtag, but he does not want to resign.
Because on Friday voted for the dissolution of parliament.
Previously, the surprise resignation of a Green MP from her parliamentary group in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the Landtag election, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from the CDU and the FDP.
The former Green MP Elke Twesten justified her move with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
“I see my political future in the CDU,” she said Friday in Hanover.
CDU Group Chief Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his Group that they be included.
Thus, CDU and FDP together had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Landtag, SPD and Grüne 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new Landtag will be elected regularly on January 14 next year.
Thümler said the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to govern in this situation without a majority.
Stephan Weil, however, considers it essential that the Landtag resolves its self-dissolution as quickly as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday.
The state constitution also provides for the possibility that the Landtag deprives the Prime Minister of confidence and elects a successor.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities need to be examined legally cleanly,” said Thumler.
"You will discuss all the questions in peace if they are legally reasonably examined."
Thümler called Twesten's step "but somewhat curious".
The politician himself stressed: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good.”
She referred to herself as a follower of Black-Green.
The Greens called on the apostate MPs to return their Landtag mandate.
"We naturally assume that she will return her Landtag mandate, which she has received via the green country list, with immediate effect," the country's presidents Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner said in a statement.
Green Party leader Anja Piel said: "We regret the decision of Elke Twesten extremely much".
It has deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the group.
"Even against the background that there were no substantive differences, we cannot understand this step."
SPD chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of the Green MP Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The behavior of the former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of voters, but also betrayal of red-green," the Federal President of the Social Democrats wrote on Facebook Friday.
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil’s (SPD’s) decision to have the country’s parliament re-elected quickly.
The departure of Twestens costs Red-Green in Lower Saxony the majority.
The politician “puts her personal interests before the well-being of the country in her wounded vanity and frustration,” SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil criticized.
"It's a scandal that the CDU is joining this dirty intrigue game in Lower Saxony and trying to beat political capital out of it".
Niedersachsen’s CDU group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend that his MPs include Elke Twesten in the CDU.
The leader of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of falsifying the results of the 2013 state election with personal career thinking.
The CDU was the strongest force before the SPD, but the SPD and the Greens had a thin majority of one vote in the Landtag.
Agriculture Minister in Interview - How do we protect ourselves from poison eggs, Mr. Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How did the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is in an interview with the editorial network Deutschland (RND) for an answer.
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp print.
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de, the federal states submit the latest information on the affected egg batches.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we currently know, a health hazard is practically excluded.
Does Aldi now take over the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of the supply - because the central role of the informant is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the task of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house has opened up immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since becoming aware of the concern of Germany.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Trade, like manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are transportable and harmless to health.
If eggs have exceeded the maximum residue content of 0.005 mg/kg, they are not transportable.
However, unladen eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time, the companies are not to blame.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to the current state of knowledge, production companies are not directly to blame.
Rather, they have to expect economic damage due to allegedly illegal practices by service companies.
As always, there are not enough controllers in the event of an emergency.
Is it only missing from the staff or from the consistent competence?
It was the official controls that revealed the process.
The truth is, however, that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded 100%.
This is precisely why a consistent explanation of such events and the handover to the public prosecutors in cases where criminal offences may exist are crucial.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect a complete clarification from the responsible authorities.
Is regular alarmism really necessary in food scandals?
Consumers have the right to receive only safe and transportable food.
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
Through the armored means, manufacturers, dealers and consumers have come into a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear: the unlawful use of the insecticide Fipronil in the keeping of food-producing animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect from all the competent authorities that the matter will be clarified quickly and completely.
How football’s financial rules affect Neymar’s move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending by European football clubs will not interfere with Neymar’s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences for Paris Saint-Germain will still come from UEFA, as the leading organisation that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that Neymar’s transfer was funded without much loss.
Barcelona has paid $222 million ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar’s move to France.
PSG can certainly make the money easier for Neymar to sign and take him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team’s funding by Qatar’s energy-rich ruling family.
Clubs may spend a lot of money on acquiring players, but must counter with legitimate sources of income that allow them to break-even point in their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had taken on enormous debt in their pursuit of success effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on the club’s debt to monitoring its losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 – bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand – should become a harder affair.
During the current three-year FFP investment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros.
And although Platini has fallen in disgrace from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to work to deter excessive spending.
“Certainly, FFP is not dead and we will certainly continue to strengthen the rules for the future,” Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid Neymar’s buy-out clause in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the amount of proceeds for the next five years can be shown in the amount of 44.4 million euros in the annual financial statements.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 hit PSG, along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros – and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014/15 Champions League season remain limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outsmart their financial supervision by inflating their revenue through companies associated with the owners of a club.
While a Qatari company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship exceeded standard market rates, UEFA would not let this be considered a legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of sponsoring the PSA was bloated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come about via payments from the World Cup 2022 organizing committee in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors and that such a maneuver could be easy for UEFA regulators to figure out.
The sanctions against PSG so far mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA did not have any preliminary talks with PSG about Neymar’s transfer, said on Thursday the people familiar with the situation.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015/16 with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
Accounts for the last financial year still need to be published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The association assumes that the turnover will increase by at least 30 percent after the signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best footballers go, and she tried to prevent Neymar's move by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
"It's a clear case of 'financial doping' with the club and the state," La Liga president Javier Tebas told the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga’s reservations against a state that finances an association.
“It’s the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
“Once a country has an association, anything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a great actor to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new Schoggi supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has produced board chocolate for Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is coming to a possible end: the airline is rescheduling the order.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report by the newspaper "Northwestern Switzerland" on Friday at the request of the news agency sda.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be inspected every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
“We are very satisfied with the current supplier of Chocolat Frey,” the spokeswoman said.
Around 17 million small red-and-white packed Schoggi boards distribute 14 grams per year to flight attendants before landing to passengers.
The Swiss did not want to give any information about the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Northwestern Switzerland" at CHF 1.5 to 2 million - the Migros subsidiary achieves annual sales of around CHF 1 billion.
But the advertising effect is all the more important: for a Schoggi manufacturer, it is a prestigious order.
Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants there are in the new tender.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to make an effort to renew the contract beyond spring 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for comment.
Since 2006, Swiss has been distributing chocolate tablets on board their flights.
Before the Swiss signed a contract with Migros’ daughter, Barry Callebaut had supplied the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.
Swiss introduced the possibility of placing the logo two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers are pampered with treats from Confiserie Sprüngli, in Business Class passengers from Lindt and in Economy Class from Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi from Chocolat Frey is also distributed on the short distance, both in business and in economy class.
Athletics - Discus Olympic champion Robert Harting reaches World Cup final
The three-time world champion fights for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, the 2016 Olympic champion, had failed in the national World Cup and was only able to watch the discus competition from the grandstand.
Also with the first attempt, the Polish defending champion Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters away, qualified for the final fight.
Nostalgia goes into the niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This repetition of the story is simultaneously nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s Grunge era (as the thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter filmed the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Paul Poe, went on to star.
As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By sticking to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny kids who grow up - they nevertheless managed to gain the impossibility of winning back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody goes more according to the casting can principle, including a riff on the stalker films of the 90s such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand That Swings the Cradle").
At one point, a character browses through an Apple powerbook, some inline skates, and “a number of other things from 1991.”
Many of the central stories are the same.
The lovely Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there’s another crazy-evil plot that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) now backed by George H. W. Bush (a well-successful impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It is especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's lower lip beard from "Singles", whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It’s the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a sort of repeating “Seven Up!” series until it reaches what I assume as its logical conclusion: “Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later”, whose final scene will show the band how to attend the film premiere of “Wet Hot American Summer”.
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War by "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its east-to-west wrestling iconography.
The comedy with Rhys Thomas as director, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, indicates to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two police officers as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main characters - a hard-spoken Gregor and an idealistic iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - ensures a decent game 'Find out the voice'.
But “Comrade Detective” is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama—a killer wearing a Reagan mask is included—that it often plays like a single one.
In six long episodes, it pulls away, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective", which has been edited to a smaller length, could better deliver its Agitprop satire, as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything food for a lay.
The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own recent history and with their own.
Attack on drug mafia in the country
The police have succeeded in beating the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, according to the Konstanz Public Prosecutor’s Office on Friday.
15 defendants between the ages of 25 and 77 were arrested and already issued arrest warrants against them.
In addition, officials secured larger amounts of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested in simultaneous raids in Italy.
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspected Italians.
The two are therefore likely to be shipped to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
A total of more than 300 police officers were in service.
Members of the Mafia are accused of organized drug crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder, as well as robbery and extortion.
Since the summer of 2016, the Konstanz Public Prosecutor’s Office has been investigating the organised drug trafficking in southern Germany.
Between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, the large-scale operation on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo.
In particular, Italian nationals with close ties to the Italian mafia were targeted at the investigations.
Also an incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning, is likely to go to the gang's account.
Wiese complains of major gaps in the foreign register
"Data from citizens who should not appear there": According to a report, the foreign registry in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to some serious misdeeds in asylum proceedings.
According to a media report, the Federal Government Commissioner for Refugee Management, Frank-Jürgen Weise, drew attention to large gaps in the central register of foreigners.
Defects in the data recorded there could lead to "partially serious misdecisions" in asylum proceedings and deportations, cautioned in an analysis available to the "Süddeutsche Zeitung".
According to the register, 10 million people with foreign citizenship are registered, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data is therefore managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been adequately maintained, the data quality in parts had not been good so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 have been found, "by people who are long since no longer alive, or by citizens who have become German citizens and should not actually appear in the register".
“Error data input can significantly slow return processes,” the report said.
In addition, the statistics on persons subject to exit are covered by EU citizens who do not have to leave at all.
Such misallocations, however, led to a "distorted debate about how to deal with those who are forced to leave", according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the federal government apparently started sending refugee families with under 16-year-old children back to Italy when they arrived from there.
This is based on an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "New Osnabrück newspaper".
According to the paper, the BAMF conducts such procedures "with regard to families with children - with the exception of infants and young children - to Italy again since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, this has been virtually impossible, according to the newspaper, referring to the difficult situation on site.
According to the Dublin Agreement, refugees are responsible for the EU state they first reach.
If a migrant continues to travel to another EU country, that country can send him back to the country of entry.
The Office said: "In the meantime, the capacity to host families with underage children in Italy has increased significantly".
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
Ulla Jelpke, a spokesman for the left-wing political group in the Bundestag, said: “Families with children are threatened by conditions that violate human rights and endanger the well-being of their children because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system.”
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach already made the blood donation service available to other people.
At least from the 12 citizens who were awarded on Friday.
Above all, Jürgen Greule, who with his now 100 donations now shared 50 liters of blood.
Traditionally, the community appreciates the multiple willingness to donate blood at the meeting of the municipal council.
“It’s brilliant how our body is designed to do this and we pay respect to the donors who make their blood available to strangers, even more unselfishly,” said Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood donation helps several people," explained Holger Maisenbacher, head of the German Red Cross (DRK), because the canned food is broken down into its components.
Three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions carried out in Oberreichenbach in the spring.
“This year, we achieved the second best result with 114 donors,” said the DRC’s circular readiness leader.
Apparently, the move to the theater house a few years ago led to higher numbers of participants.
Before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded 50 blood donations each.
Half as many books were written by Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrummer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter gave away 500 milliliters of their juice ten times each.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation about an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain “slow” as it maintained interest rates on family income in the midst of increasing pressure.
The Bank’s Monetary Committee (MPC) policymakers voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25 %, with fewer members aiming for an increase this month as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6%, warning that pressure on household income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to almost 3% in autumn.
But she signaled that in the next few years interest rate increases would be needed to curb inflation fueled by Brexit, and she said credit costs might need to rise more than expected in the financial markets.
The members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth economic package, which was issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks as of next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide <0xC2><0xA3>15 billion more under this system – with <0xC2><0xA3>115 billion sterling.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the bank said: “In the central forecast of the MPC, the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as the pressure on real household income continues to strain consumption.”
At interest rates, she reiterated that "a certain tightening of monetary policy" would be necessary to cool inflation and a "something greater" extent than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that increases would be "step-by-step" and "limited".
The Bank’s downward-adjusted growth forecasts for this and next year are 1.9% and 1.7% compared to the forecast in May.
It maintained its growth forecast at 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after this news against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and fell by 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision will not change after recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations of an interest rate hike and GDP has risen from 0.2% in the second quarter to 0.3% in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly by the end of the year after the bank.
The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and low wage increases, as the tightening will first get worse before it will improve.
She added that monetary policy cannot "prevent income loss" in the next few years, but added that wages will recover "significantly" at the end of their three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will compensate for some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes one year after the fall in interest rates to 0.25% last August after the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall.
The bank estimates that it will probably take four years for this to fully reach prices and the economy.
Prior to the Bank’s last judgment on interest rates, the call for an increase in interest rates had increased as inflation increased the pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation has fallen from 2.9% in June to 2.6% in the past month, although the bank said it was expected to do so and will attract it again in the coming months.
The bank said the overrun in relation to its 2% target was attributed to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again as lenders are looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those who run out of existing deals and close out the new mortgages, and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular.”
NHS (National Health Service) to prescribe controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
Patients will receive access to a “transformative” HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight in front of the High Court against funding the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) taken before sexual intercourse, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by about 86 percent, is now being delivered by the health service via a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to finance the trial after the appeals court last year confirmed a Supreme Court ruling that the NHS had the authority to pay for PrEP despite the claim that local authorities should fund it.
The chess move announced Thursday was hailed by NHS England boss Simon Stevens as "important new intervention", while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as a "decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register, and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in a person’s body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or as early as two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals, and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
In clinics, appropriate participants are identified who agree to the study, including men, women, transgender and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The program will be <0xC2><0xA3>10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study is intended to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence as it is used, recorded and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: “This major new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of sustained progress in addressing one of humanity’s greatest health challenges.”
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust), said: “This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if it is targeted at needy and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, people at high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “The priority now must be to ensure that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one at risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that PrEP testing has been procured, we are on track to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people.”
Sharon Hodgson, shadow health minister, said: “The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us one step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible across the country to protect people who are HIV-infected and that it will help us get one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society."
Living the Big Life: Middle Floor and Clever Designer Tricks Have Turned This Little Earls Court Apartment Into A Spacious Home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, narrowed down from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It’s on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace – and it’s proof of the new design that Joanne didn’t pack and sell her bags.
“Before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room,” says Joanne.
“I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day."
Since the first visit, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-bedroom property with a nestled layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine floor to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my request,” she says.
To this end, she commissioned Erfan Azadi’s architectural and design studio Duck & Shed from Notting Hill to use the 12.5-foot ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the problem.
“The steel mill is quite complicated,” he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend.
It wasn’t just about building a simple platform, but building the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below.”
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms at full height above each other - with a lot of additional drama.
For the mezzanine floor, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it seem longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all Joanne cutlery and glasses.
By perceiving a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Collapsible kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
“A bit of engineering went in there,” explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"It's counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slides very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, you will sell the land - or how your property is valued," Erfan says.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size."
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor area and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage.
“The materials are the things that touch you and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home,” Erfan says.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they don’t play with your heart.”
It shows that an apartment can turn into something quite amazing by good design and increased square meter number of something by default.
In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave them.
Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, are in a dispute over one of Victoria’s largest real estate empires worth over $500 million.
Former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets are to be divided.
Paul wanted to retire from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a store on Smith Street, Collingwood in 1973.
There, the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
This money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis’ portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as shopping malls in the suburbs.
According to an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as "main operator and dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one-third.
A court file states that this means that Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.
The division of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem for Paul.
“The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I considered the best objects,” he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business – which Colin, as Paul claims, has ruled out.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of managing some possessions incompetently.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
Costs are rising in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessens from the late 1950s and bought a store in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They took advantage of the security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property to their sons.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
Both Lukas and Mark, Paul says, “has become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation.”
Colin has been very reluctant, although he was a former AFL board member and, according to a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the television star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin responded via SMS to say "I really can't say much" because the case was before the courts.
"It's very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and pull our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he had tried to meet his brother’s demands.
“Our father wouldn’t have wanted Paul and I to end our current dispute,” he said, adding that he “still hopes for a solution.”
On Friday, that hope seemed to be over.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump’s new chief of staff plans to limit the president’s media abstinence.
Others tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the White House's new chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in hopes of keeping the chief on a more even course.
Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:
“When John F. Kelly, the White House’s new chief of staff, met with senior executives on his first working day, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump’s White House that he wanted to repair: bad information coming into the hands of the president.
Kelly told employees that information about him should flow — whether on paper or in briefings — because the president would make better decisions if he received good information.”
Kelly’s diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump’s relationship with television goes back decades – and now that he’s in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
“If candidate Trump was upset about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from positions that were convincing,” former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico’s Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that “the key to keeping Trump’s Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to make sure his personal media consumption includes a steady praise.”
- Okay.
But the idea that Trump’s Twitter habit was ever “under control” is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don’t know about others – that Trump’s tweets would have contained even more fuel without their interventions.
We’ll probably never know anything about the tweets Trump didn’t send.
If his employees have managed to keep him out of trouble a few times, then their efforts have been worth it.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House, made up of competing parties, are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views of the world.
Politico - fully engaged in this story - reported in May on the preference of the advisers to provide the president with dubious information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is determined to find out where they come from.
That’s exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being “the source behind a bunch of leaks” in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of harassment, or that he offered no concrete evidence, or that he has expressed false accusations in the past and revoked them.
Trump read the article and started questioning employees about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary General Rob Porter "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives."
How did that work?
Kelly tries to do the same thing three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence.
These immutable factors make Kelly’s mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals get mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population is requested and hoped.
Police across Europe are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer.
Since the addresses of the wanted serious offenders are naturally unknown, hints from the population are hoped and requested.
On Friday, Europol reported on the action following the "EU Most Wanted" advent calendar of winter.
Experience has shown that many refugees are hiding from holiday destinations, Europol said.
21 postcards have been collected for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
So far, 36 of the online searches have been arrested, at least eleven of them due to indications after the publication on the website.
Travelers negotiate over a trench and return to the 'Millionaires' series
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands once again stand at war with some determined travelers who have negotiated a trench drawn by the community to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
Travelers parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull, called the “Millionaires’ Series.”
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were thrown out in May, but without being deterred by a ditch dug by the council to prevent their invasions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defenses and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.
Angry residents have urged the council of Solihull, who said it was "useless to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said, "They moved there on Monday night after being sent on by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passers-by.
The Council must be forced into action by shame to implement it, since it was useless to deal with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, were moved on and are now back.
More arrived last night, probably even more today.”
She added, "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by holding long lessons to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue paying my community tax if the council can't even stop it."
A resident who didn’t want to be named said, “It’s ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers just to be sacked by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you’ve even seen a horse in the park area.”
A Solihull Council spokeswoman said: “We are aware of an unauthorised camp in the countryside beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with Solihull Police. We are taking the necessary legal steps to get them moving as quickly as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case."
From Birkenhof Waldhotel Luise
From the former Hotel Birkenhof is the Waldhotel Luise.
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on March 1 next year.
This is good news for the city.
With the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, around 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost at the time and also revenues from the tourist tax.
In autumn 2014, in the face of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the county, the hotel building was offered to the Landratsamt as a collective accommodation, causing controversial discussions.
The city prevented asylum seekers from being accommodated by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
At the time, the decision was not undisputed in the municipal council.
But above all, the mayor of Freudenstadt Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke to serious interested parties at the house.
He should be right.
The group of Luisenhotels with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof, building shed containers have been in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it will be clear what extensive renovation work is being carried out.
The floors were torn out, ceilings partly dismantled, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is still much to do until March.
“It’s actually a nice hotel,” says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
Everything should later become "beautiful close to the citizen", as Thomas Scherer puts it.
“We want to make a piece of jewelry out of it.”
Swimming pool, spa area and meeting room are included.
You don’t want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already at an elevated downtown level, Scherer emphasizes.
The Waldhotel Luise, with its approximately 60 rooms, wants to set itself up broadly, Scherer further explains.
Both individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.
He has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, according to Scherer.
The ideas of the city are identical with those of the hotel group.
“We are on the same line.”
Asked about the amount of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to define himself exactly.
Less than a million euros, he expects.
The outdoor facilities are also brought to the fore, which is already clearly visible.
In a courtyard a large terrace is created, which will be accessible by the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freuenstadt is a good market".
Russia affair: U.S. special counsel appoints Grand Jury
In the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Trump, Special Counsel Robert Mueller is said to have appointed a so-called Grand Jury.
The committee has taken up the work in recent weeks, wrote the Wall Street Journal citing people familiar with the matter.
The paper valued the move as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigation.
CNN reported that there were already initial subpoenas from the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump’s eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
U.S. intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of deliberately interfering in the 2016 presidential campaign.
Mueller is investigating whether there were any agreements between Trump’s campaign team and Moscow.
The investigation will focus on several men who acted as advisors to the Republican in the election campaign.
According to reports, Mueller also increasingly explored Trump’s private and business environment.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the special investigator Trump personally stepped into the center and investigated the accusation of whether the president may have obstructed justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine existing evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide whether to bring charges.
Grand juries are therefore also called prosecution chambers.
They are usually turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.
The process always takes place behind closed doors.
The panel can also be turned on by the prosecutor's office to invite people to the hearing under oath.
According to CNN, subpoenas have already been issued that revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
Persons involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump’s advisers and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his then campaign chief Paul Manafort were also in the conversation.
Legal experts said on Thursday evening in U.S. television that the deployment shows that Mueller does not let himself be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he wants to act quickly.
However, it should not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the prosecution.
Nevertheless, the setting up of the panel is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
“Russia’s history is a complete invention,” Trump said.
The issue gives Democrats a way to “feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about.”
His special adviser Ty Cobb said in a statement that he knew nothing about the establishment of a grand jury.
They usually work in secret, he said.
The White House is in favour of any measure that has accelerated the work of the special investigator in a "fair" manner.
Former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that the investigation will not be conducted against the president.
There is no reason to believe that something has changed about this, the statement said.
Mueller had only been deployed after Trump fired Comey.
Because of this outburst, accusations against Trump had become loud, he wanted to obstruct the judiciary.
Comey told a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to stop the investigation against then national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.
According to U.S. media, the White House collected material against the special investigator and his associates.
This sparked speculation about whether Trump wanted to release Mueller.
Unlike an independent special investigator of Congress, such as in the Watergate affair about the later resignation of President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the urging of the President by the Department of Justice.
However, several senators from both parties want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented draft laws on Thursday, according to which the special investigator could no longer be dismissed so easily.
Antarctica: Giant iceberg drifts in Antarctica
In the West Antarctic, a giant iceberg of the almost seven times the size of Berlin has detached itself from the shelf ice.
This was announced by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven on Wednesday.
The colossus, which weighs over a trillion tons and is 5800 square kilometers, is now drifting north and will probably take two or three years for it to melt.
With a length of 175 kilometers and a width of up to 50 kilometers, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades.
A danger to people does not come from him.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg is unclear, according to researchers.
Overall, however, there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice shelves in the region for about 30 years, writes the U.S. Snow and Ice Research Center (NSIDC) in a factual background.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The now broken-down colossus was so far a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.
Shelf ice swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen C Shelf Ice is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.
To the north of this shelf ice was disturbed the balance of waxes and breaks a few years ago.
A complete ice shelf was destroyed there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is a lot of evidence that the Larsen-C shellfish is also in danger, because the front edge has never retreated as far as it is currently.
In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can decay if a piece breaks off at a key point.
The melting of shelf ice and iceberg does not increase sea level, as they float on the water and displace ice as much water as it yields after melting itself.
However, the loss of the shelf ice means that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow out much faster than before.
This could possibly increase sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).
According to AWI data, the Larsen-C Shelf Ice is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica with almost 50,000 square kilometers.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the leading edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
It regularly breaks down there.
“Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a more vulnerable position,” said Martin O’Leary of Swansea University.
"This is the longest withdrawal since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, there is controversy as to whether the Larsen C shellfish will grow again or go back in the long run and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman, adding: “Our models say it will be less stable.”
But this development will take decades.
Even though these researchers do not trace the collapse of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, in recent decades, many ice shelves of the Antarctic Peninsula have collapsed.
This long tip of Antarctica stretches towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the Antarctic Peninsula's ice area has decreased by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The decrease contributed to the increase in temperature.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by around three degrees over the past 50 years, counting among the areas where the temperature is rising the fastest.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security wants staff
As it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vacant positions, the CDU is demanding to leave the employers’ association in order to become more attractive.
Just shortly before the summer break, the circular day has won 41 new positions in the administration.
More than 1,100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now another 17 trainees have their first working day behind them.
The teaching positions in the circle seem to be very sought after.
Around 620 applications were submitted for the places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless, the circle still lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
Currently, there are still 50 unoccupied positions in the district of Mettmann.
Among other things, doctors and engineers as well as powers of general administration are sought.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and counter the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.
According to the wishes of the parties, the administration is to develop "a concept for the recruitment and development of personnel".
The aim is not only to meet the short-term needs of professionals, but to counteract the applicant shortage in a future-oriented manner.
The overall concept should be oriented internally and externally, show concrete measures for cross-beginners and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn’t know before.
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
The speech is about a real "competition of public employers".
In addition, a large number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age.
It is high time to act so that no more jobs are left unoccupied.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, the leader of the CDU, goes beyond the joint motion with his party.
He recently caused a huge surprise on the day of the circuit when he publicly questioned the personnel cost cover and surprised the other parties.
Peoples want all possibilities to be reviewed, which allow a withdrawal from the municipal employers' association.
"If we do not come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the county administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county-based cities - should aim for a house tariff," said Völker.
In this way, the CDU tries to pay employees and officials better than the public service tariff system actually provides for.
Salaries are currently prescribed exactly, increases or more money are only available if you switch to a higher level, which is based on professional years.
However, the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees took care of the provisions of the new Prostitutes Protection Act.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, County Councillor Thomas Hendele and County Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.
Italy tightens the tone of NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs using lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they should not continue if they do not comply with new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitis’ warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German aid organization ‘Jugend Rettet’ because their team had worked effectively with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on detailed allegations made by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
“For us, saving human life is and remains our top priority, so we are very sorry that we are not currently able to operate in the search and rescue zone,” the organization said in a statement on social media.
"We can only assess all the allegations currently being raised after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat from Youth Rescue, the Iuventa, since October.
It is believed that his crew will take on-board inflatable migrants, which will be delivered directly to them by human traffickers, and that smugglers will be able to disembark so that the ships can be used again.
At least such a meeting allegedly took place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor’s file, the content of which was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of ignoring the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which monitors rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reasons.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must primarily have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to adhere to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Active Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring "essential changes or disabilities" to their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel laureate organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti meanwhile said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue measures has fallen sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit.
"In recent days, we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in hopes of reaching Europe.
Increases and Trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy four-day trials and attractions.
Three friendly guides were available for this.
The accommodation in the Wachenheim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards.
It was followed by viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far above the Palatinate Forest and the upstream plains.
In between, there were always longer climbs, for which long trials rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and to the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, the vantage point was lined up at the vantage point, connected by "flowy" trials and moderate climbs.
On the last two days, many altitude meters were announced again.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and taverns brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed healing brine in the outdoor inhaler.
Neustadt was also driven.
After 173 kilometers and almost 4,500 meters of altitude, the group had met the Palatinate Forest from its best side - sporting and cultural.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga equips for e-sports
Are the sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles in the future, instead of fighting sweaty in wind and weather over the stadium races?
E-Sports has long become a serious industry, a lucrative business – big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gags included.
This has also been recognized by the first Bundesliga clubs, which are increasingly engaged in this area.
In 2015, VfL Wolfsburg started, followed by FC Schalke 04 and lastly VfB Stuttgart, which established an e-sports department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game.
"We hope to inspire completely new young target groups for the VfB," says Jochen Röttgermann, CEO.
He is sure that "there are still a number of clubs on this train".
This coming weekend, the FIFA World Football Association in London is organizing the first Interactive Club World Cup, where the players of different clubs compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and the PSV Eindhoven qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual footballers.
“Real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 year olds in particular, that the young people still go to the stadium in the future,” says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-sports under contract, one could be present online far more often in these markets than just sending the Bundesliga team to Asia once a year.
What exactly is it about?
In e-sports, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or the FIFA football simulation are contested at the competitive level.
As in normal sports, leagues have long established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, E-Sport is already part of the official program.
But is it really a sport?
For many, the idea is definitely a need for getting used to.
Ingo Froböse has also dealt with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne, e-sports is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
In addition, it requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding, and a rapid responsiveness.
Professional gamers should train not only on the console, but also their body and pay attention to the diet.
"The fit player is a good player."
However, Froböse also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more an issue".
Controls are difficult to carry out in online games, and the scene lacked the structures of classical sports.
Positively, the scientist highlights the high integrative effect of e-sports.
Players are traveling internationally, which is like a large global family, as there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sports.
In 2016, 50 million euros were implemented in Germany, mainly via advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, sales are expected to reach 130 million.
This is little compared to the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga.
However, e-sports are “no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey,” the Deloitte consultants write.
Many countries are already on the international stage.
Major markets include Asia and the United States, where ex-basketball players Shaquille O<0x60>Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the U.S. team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in eSports betting provider Unikrn.
There is a lot going on in Europe too.
In a Norwegian school, e-sports was introduced as a subject of instruction, Froböse says.
In the Netherlands and France, according to Dutt, the Football First League clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department.
"In a European comparison, Germany is lagging behind," explains VfB board member Röttgermann.
To fall into nostalgia and to explain the old times is no longer enough today.
It is about preserving the tradition of the association, but at the same time aligning the company with the modern market.
“We live in a digitalized world,” Dutt says.
"You can't hold on to the fact that only in football everything stays the same as it always has been."
Gift egg ade - The egg alternatives for cooking and baking
Almost all federal states are affected by the scandal surrounding poisoned eggs.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have responded and taken all the eggs out of sales throughout Germany.
Only eggs that do not contain fipronil are to be taken into the shelves.
Michelle Carter Sentenced to Convict for the Texts That Push Conrad Roy to Suicide
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide by texting and calling.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years were suspended for probation.
Carter was convicted in June of negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father said at the hearing on Thursday: “My family is inconsolable.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was allowed to remain free until the call.
She had been faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a creamy blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, folded hands, and down-facing eyes when she was convicted.
"Your actions have killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended her life to make her own better.
She did not take responsibility,” she said.
"She has shown no remorse".
But Carter’s lawyer said it was a “terrible circumstance that she completely regrets.”
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find out that her “age or maturity or even her mental illness has a significant impact on her actions.”
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, that there is "no day when I will not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything, and I try to be there for his sisters despite all the pain we will carry with us for eternity.”
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she was "persecuted" by the realization that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
“No longer having that one person I’ve been with every day since I was born is a pain I’ll always keep with me for the rest of my life,” she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carter’s text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
“Hang on, jump off a building, start yourself, I don’t know, there are many ways,” she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention by Roy's death and ordered that she should benefit from the case through some press.
The case shared the legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of murdering her British roommate in Italy before she was acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, age 30, posted in the Los Angeles Times a comment: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not jail."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new mini-lamm of FC Bayern
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup is no coincidence.
FC Bayern trust the Confed Cup winner for a big season - extra motivation doesn't hurt there.
Something was different in his seat in the cabin, which Joshua Kimmich immediately saw, even though the extra garment was very, very small.
But since no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer could be seen far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, he stopped the binding assigned to him.
"The coach didn't announce it," the Confed Cup winner told us afterwards, after his first assignment as Bayern captain.
Well, the offense could have run better than the 0:2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign from the coach could also interpret Kimmich as such.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal had been selected as a player in the C-Elf, consisting of youth players, debutants and professionals who had just come out of the holiday, but he.
Sugar is best distributed to those you trust a lot that you want to keep at bay.
So anyone who has been chosen to take on the legacy of lahm can only use a small extra-motivation well.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: take responsibility".
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old ran across the field as a mini-lamm.
Right back, that's his position now, the white tie on the arm did the rest.
And at all, Kimmich acted in this starting formation like the one who can best handle the rudder.
He gave instructions, tried to steer the unincorporated troop.
He had the look for the whole, while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal in overplaying his lack of fitness (didn't work well); Renato Sanches in playing devils on the performances of the Asia trip (did not work well); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle in not to be negatively noticed in their first appearance in the Bayern jersey.
Anyway, it worked out very well.
Süle ran up next to Kimmich, Rudy in front of the defence, both acting sovereignly.
The well-known Napoli storm was often difficult, and Süle also tried to successfully build the game a few times.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result "was not as we hoped it would be".
But he also showed a decent performance at the debut.
Game change, tempo change: "For this style I was also picked up".
How unusual this Bayern world is for the new arrivals, was seen after the match.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two in the catacombs, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimmich said goodbye after a few crunchy statements in the back of his new players.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "What is going on here, I have already noticed.
At Bayern, you just have to win every game.”
After all, he no longer has to teach the new.
Alaba motivates <0xC3><0x96>FB women
David Alaba believes in the success of our <0xC3><0x96>FB women
Austria’s best-known footballer just before the game has reported on Twitter and wished the <0xC3><0x96>FB ladies all the best.
Bayern-Legion<0xC3><0xA4>r is almost a clubmate of <0xC3><0x96>FB-Kapit<0xC3><0xA4>nin Schnaderbeck and celebrates with our ladies.
The tweet by the Austrian football player of the year and the Champions League winner should be a special motivational splash.
The famous Bayern shower might also need our ladies well.
Companies satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate minister: Economy praises Wissing's pace
It was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak of a change in economic policy at the request of T V - and at the same time blame the old minister.
Frank Natus, chairman of the Association of Trier Enterprises (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy, which Lemke has all blocked".
Natus sees the biggest turnaround in infrastructure policy: the gap between Kelberg and Adenau motorway 1 is now at the top of the country’s priority list.
This year, the Ministry is hoping for a planning process to be completed by 2021.
A role in the plans of the country also plays the western bypass of Trier, which is in urgent need of the Federal Transport Road Plan.
The goal is to put the track into operation in December 2020, says Ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees this as a guide to supporting regional, but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) Trier, as suggested by Wissing, strives for a Rhineland-Palatinate label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports that have been declining for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, praise the IHK.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees an additional incentive for young trainees in the new Master's Bonus, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A prize of 1000 euros is provided for the passed master’s examination and 2500 euros if graduates self-employed within ten years of master’s training.
However, the homework list for the country remains long.
In the planned road construction there are quick facts to create, at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, chief executive of IHK Trier.
Of 56 new engineers who want to hire Wissing at Landesbetrieb Mobility, only 29 jobs have been filled so far.
The IHK calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices.
CDU faction vice Christian Baldauf points to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country invests more than 20 million euros less in the receipt of state roads in 2017 and 2018 than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country as it wants to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
Furthermore, the previous broadband expansion in the country is sobering.
In 2016, regional companies had only rated the grid supply in an IHK survey with a rating of 3.4.
They complained about looming Internet connections and interruptions.
On the other hand, former Minister of Economic Affairs Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and still sits on the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where it already cleared the field after four months due to disagreements.
Audi to change 850,000 diesel vehicles – automakers face a backlash
A day before Audi’s announcement, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes that “there are smarter options than driving restrictions,” referring to European cities – including Munich, where BMW is based – to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the companies as recalls.
European automakers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules.
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost for automobile manufacturers to install plants to neutralize the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of humbling the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen that could regulate the use of so-called shut-off devices that regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car has been tested, but drive back under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees have been charged, while others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.
The former manager, Zacchio Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to justice in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and an inquiry focused on the United States was expanded.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could have a serious impact on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen’s profit.
This message has the raft on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order for the Isar visitors to participate, a raft runs through Munich on Saturday morning, which has a special message.
If you go back to Isar on Saturday, you will see a large raft between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And this is not a common raft, with Isar tourists.
But the building department wants to clarify.
On the raft you can see a large information transparent.
It shows a garbage mountain.
The launch of a public campaign to appeal to Isar visitors.
With the motto "True love is ..." the understanding of the Isar as a protected wild river should be sharpened.
Last summer, the raft crossed the Isar River and this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillo's tuber noses and laughter against suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most widely published cartoon characters, the nostrils of his characters are his hallmark.
Even at 85, the Argentinian still draws and works on a film.
His message: Laugh, "because there is too much suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932, the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In his early years as an artist, he worked as an artist, among other things, as a designer for greeting cards - which frustrated him.
“The happiest day in my professional life was the day I lost my job,” he said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he achieved his breakthrough in the late 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then in "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again, the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, round Mordillo figures abound in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
According to his own information, he is still sitting at the drawing table in the early morning, working almost ten hours a day.
About calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, t-shirts, plush animals and watches, his droll figures continue to spread widely around the world.
For six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters.
The main character in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousand footer as an opponent.
For the first time, his characters speak in the 3D film, which will be on the cinema screen in 2019.
“I don’t know exactly what they’re going to say, it’s weird for me,” Mordillo says.
The script is not written by him.
That’s why he relies more on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced wordlessly.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
The lavender has been declining due to drought-remembering conditions and disease-borne insects, causing scientists and farmers trying to find solutions to major headaches.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: “The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the fall.
This has an impact on the lifespan of lavender.
There is also a small Zika, a microbacterium that transmits dwarves, and in very dry weather there are very many of them."
And there is a lot at stake.
Lavender oil not only attracts holidaymakers, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped, and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil."
The solutions considered include better water distribution and the slowing down of evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dryness.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200th anniversary this year.
The highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Kr<0xC3><0xA4>mer, Zünfte, Handels, Vaganten or a Landsknechtslager are to be experienced in the city centre these days.
The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico
Employees of Riodoce weekly usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in Sinaloa state through organized crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children to the office, which in 2009 was the goal of an attack with grenades, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a board on the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on the government’s or cartel payroll, a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no rest from the violence, and while the bodies are piled up throughout the country, there are more and more journalists: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven states this year.
Among the latter is her editor and inspiration from Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence.
His absence is felt deeply, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hangs on the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor’s office was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organized crime every year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating Sinaloa’s violence, although they are inconsolable and although the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the killers, without justice, the meeting has little benefit to discuss security, Ibarra says.
“It’s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop,” he says.
"As long as we don't know why, we all distrust."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the Riodoce newspaper in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot at him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which translates as "Twelfth River".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a woman and two grown children.
Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, as rival factions here are fighting to fill the vacuum.
It doesn’t matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "rest" if only one cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is guilty of failing to protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions at the war with Guzman’s sons.
This publication may have upset the sons, suspected gang members bought every copy of the edition once it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he teamed up with five colleagues to found Riodoce and sold $50 stakes.
In Sinaloa, “it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the drug problem,” Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors-Cabot Prize" for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history wherever she led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa “is a way of life,” he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You have to take on the task that you as a journalist are doing - either that or you are playing the dumb one.
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do in the face of so many deaths... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird who could curse like a port worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love for routine his destruction?
His death has also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do her job and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways and runways" to move drugs.
“These things were not allowed,” Bojorquez said.
The result is, even in the best of times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust your own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal said, "A smell of a sense that can be fooled ... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa – just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce employees met for security training, phones were suddenly not allowed. Days before it was announced that spyware, sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.
They were tasked by the state government to protect Riodoce’s offices in a four-story building in a middle-class quarter of Culiacan.
Half in the joke, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers who the governor himself described as untrustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters went into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week’s edition, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exhibition on government spending, which focused on the governor’s hometown.
And there was a group who carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was given when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite venue of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels almost throughout the century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this venue, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military assault.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have considered the Valdez column to be the best-informed source on kidnapping.
“We used to know what happened,” said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed “El Flaco” because of his slender body shape.
“Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken.”
Valdez’s office has been transformed into a storage room for signs and stickers protesting the killings of journalists, because the employees have become something they would never have expected: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning for another journalist to the prosecutor’s office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his.
Throughout the country, journalists have become more vocal by writing down "SOS Press" on walkways and buildings in organized protests.
On this day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was assassinated, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them because they told the truth.
She has since asked that she be reclassified by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were “surrounded” by organized crime, government officials involved in it, and an indifferent society.
In his latest book Narco-Journalism, he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were under a blanket with the organized crime.
The media watchdog group "Articulo 19" has assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and officials last year.
“In Mexico, you die because they want you to keep your mouth shut,” Ramirez said.
Obviously, the killings have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to her severed head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page titled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even from the country.
It's a painful decision.
It’s hard to find work in exile, and they’re still watching the streets and looking for danger.
And sometimes they are hunted, as apparently photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after fleeing from Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade scares him.
“Mexico is going to hell, and that’s why I became a reporter,” he said.
At midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue had already ended, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones began to buzz.
A number of shootings involving gang rivals and security forces near the resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a number of cartel messages in the region.
From the curbside, they published the news on Riodoce’s website via mobile phone.
The title page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens cheered up nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the police officers who were guarding to see if they were ready.
If they were scared at all, they wouldn’t show it.
Under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to the whole of Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed his trail.
"How can you even think of closing down," said Bojorquez, "if on the same day that Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the street for reporting."
Dinosaurs used camouflage to evade their enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, though a frightening one.
Now, researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhinoceros of a Canadian miner have been so well preserved that experts have described it as the “Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs”.
It was so well preserved that they could even notice that his scaly skin was of reddish brown – and they said she had something of a “disturbed past.”
The report in the journal "Current Biology" described him as "the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world".
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurs that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly well-preserved condition has baffled researchers who describe it as "really remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivore is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he dug on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
He met something that seemed to be missing from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) heavy earth lump.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
“If you only blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it has slept,” said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that although this herbivore is covered with armor and resembles a walking tank, it was likely threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as anti-shadowing, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to blend better into its environment and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old creature from the Nodosaur family made headlines for the first time in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours uncovering it carefully.
The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor across his body.
They discovered the countershading, a widespread method of defense in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although the contrast shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure from meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favored the veiling of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use countershading—think of deer, zebras, or shingles—are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, signaling that this nodosaur was exposed to a real battle for survival.
"Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous must have been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red-brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved intestinal contents, to find out what it ate as its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank to the seabed on his back.
At that time Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaur is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
“The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did in the early Cretaceous.
You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it, and if you just shove a little with your eyes, you could almost believe he's sleeping."
The Cretaceous was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, who stood on two legs, crossed the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his fearsome ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) long, six-ton monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was sunk in the sea after death and mummified in mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he dug on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the snout to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long laces that stood out from his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored herbivore was swam through western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover hollow armor plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rare as a win in the lottery.
The more I see it, the more confusing it becomes.
Stoned remnants of the skin still cover the bumpy armor plates that carry the animal’s skull.
His right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upward.
I can count the scales on his sole.
In the Storm: Mass Carambolage on A8: Many Injured
Heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8: Nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage.
There are numerous injured, kilometer-long traffic jams and gaffs.
On the Stuttgart-Munich (A8) motorway, about 20 people were injured in a mass carambolage on late Thursday afternoon.
According to the police, around 5 p.m. between the junctions Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Aichach-Friedberg County) during a thunderstorm, almost 30 vehicles, including probably also trucks, were intertwined.
At first, there was no information on the exact number of casualties.
They are mild to moderate injuries, a police spokesman said.
A large supply of emergency vehicles was at the scene of the accident.
The A8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich.
In the direction of Munich, a backstau was formed around ten kilometers long.
As an AZ reporter reports, there were also massive handicaps on the roadway – through numerous gaps.
The fire brigade noted the characteristics of the vehicle handlers, which now have to reckon with sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 6:45 p.m. a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "Comfort Check-in"
It’s a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: nothing suspicious is sitting on the train and sleeping.
Or you are deeply immersed in his work and just have a brilliant thought.
And then: pufff.
Comes the creator and wakes one unsophisticated or rips the passenger out of the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the times of the interruptions are soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the hassle-free ticket control.
You simply confirm by phone that you have taken your place and thus devalue the ticket.
A test operation is currently running on two routes.
"If the offer comes up, let's expand it.
It is expected to be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year," said a rail spokesman.
"Comfort check-in" the train calls the ticket devaluation without Schaffner.
However, in order to be able to use them, some prerequisites must be met: You need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you have to have booked an online ticket - what most passengers already do anyway.
You also need to buy it via the app of the train, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of booking tickets anyway.
Last but not least, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "Comfort Check-in" works like this: You get on the train, call up your ticket under "My Tickets".
A button for electronic devaluation will then appear for the test customers.
The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
When the train attendant comes to the seat Y when checking the ticket, he knows that there is a passenger with an already devalued online ticket.
So you can continue to sleep, continue to work, keep quiet.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should be used by the passengers.
"If you want to travel in a relaxed way without a ticket check by our train attendants, you simply check in yourself in the DB Navigator.
This allows passengers to make their journey time on the train more personal,” says Michael Peterson, marketing director of DB Fernverkehr.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs".
Those who often drive trains know that, in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket controls are among the biggest troubles.
Because often you yourself, but in any case one of the fellow travelers does not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets.
Either the credit card or the ID card or any other document you need to present.
The result is endless discussions between the train attendant and the passenger, which leads to a poor mood in the compartment or large room and delays in the control of your own ticket and ultimately takes the time for the creator to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
And this also only on the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen connections.
Further train numbers on the same route are not yet unlocked.
How did an activist come to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just a day after arriving in New York City, the St. Louis native was sitting on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled across a post from someone from high school.
“The police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and it’s still on the street,” he said.
Confused that no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the Handle @TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The rapper from the St. Louis area was about to tweet live the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body, which was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She turned off her phone to return to tweets about people on the Canfield drive later in the evening.
There were photos of the police band and people screaming, and of a man claiming to be Brown's father, wearing a sign with the inscription, "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman reassured his rifle and shouted, "I'll kill you... animals all."
“That’s not common,” Ferrell recalled.
“That’s not the kind of murder we’ve gotten used to and can typically call it.”
At that moment, I felt chill.
I was angry and wept.”
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father’s house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the subject of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?", in cinemas from the 11th century onwards.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resilience, which is from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell and her daughter, wearing a flower dress and a matching crown, drove to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation they had countless times before this morning “about the black experience and the black state.”
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" she recalled what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take them with me," Ferrell said later.
“What happened today is a culmination of what happened in the past.
She needs to know and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well developed, not only to know activism and organization, but also to know the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to become free to free ourselves.
Even if I’m lucky enough to give her an experience where she personally experiences no blatant racism, she’s no different from the next black woman-child.
I feel like I would be doing her a bad service to keep her away from it."
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a location opposite the police department that became a campground when the activists were waiting for Officer Darren Wilson's possible non-prosecution.
There, Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who was having lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to protesters.
Slowly, a new kind of activism for Ferrell began to take shape.
“My activism has completely changed since August 9,,” she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
“I had no experience in organizing.
It's all come."
Weeks later, Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.
A question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can take advantage of?"
This skepticism has been fueled by countless cases of people, often by whites – in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently stated in an interview, “We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson didn’t center their voices and we wanted to do it differently.”
Folayan had already worked with then co-director Damon Davis, an artist in the field known for his activism around death row inmates.
His involvement brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years following Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. We're talking," Davis said.
"That was the main thing for me, how these people are portrayed, because that's how I'm going to be portrayed."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah leader, but a community coming together," Folayan said - she proved to be the film's most open participant.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and marries her wife.
“I felt like naked,” Ferrell said, laughing when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people."
In addition, Ferrell’s story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who, after the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, shaped the film "BlacklivesMatter" on social media, identify themselves as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement as a whole," Ferrell said, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything."
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really being maintained by black women and many black women".
However, it insists that “this is not an affirmative type of action” in which Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film due to her identity.
“She was the person who stirred up that energy,” she said.
"It's not a coincidence, although she was at the forefront, because there's so much at stake in a life at these intersections as a black, gay woman.
You can feel their energy through the screen.”
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on probation for 21<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 years for blocking a highway during a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A Chaos".
Still, she clings to a song and she feels committed to that memory since she walked down the street in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains.”
From "Dream" to "Grö<0xC3><0x9F>enwohn": TV readers discuss bit-gallery
The bit gallery moves people, even though it is not built yet.
But the idea of a shopping center at the southern end of the pedestrian zone divides the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Cold leaves the subject hardly any one.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While some say to the bit gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "Don't use a human being" (Siggi Betzen) or simply, "Grö<0xC3><0x9F>enwohn!" (Lars Scholz).
While proponents rely on one gallery to attract more customers to the city, which also benefits the rest of the business, opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed out.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmer’s market hall stands, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
With the start of the construction work, this will end.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - namely to the Beda square with the possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been buying in the Bauernmarkthalle almost weekly for many years.
Mostly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the country women always very much like.
We also discovered the butchers for us.
We wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.
There is that in other cities as well.
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of the rent.
This is not likely to be low on the new project.”
Eva Kilic: "What to buy in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find this unnecessary.
There is enough of that in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that we at least keep the market hall.
After all, the goods offered there are fresh, are mostly offered directly by the producer and are also inexpensive.
As you can see, shops in a shopping center are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not portable for a retailer.
There are almost no special shops anymore and what remains of it will probably disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping mall with a market hall doesn't fit together for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit Bitburg.
Above all: Where should the farmers’ market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery actually comes.
Or does the ghost bit gallery manage to sell all the stores from Bitburg before?"
George Marquet: “It just won’t work.
And a shopping center that is empty doesn’t need anyone either.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmers’ market instead of this gallery.
But there is no room for a farmers' market hall thanks to the insanely many - as I find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg.
If the farmers' market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again."
A matching similarity: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning’s DNA
In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York you can see many faces - white, black and brown, almost imperceptibly alike - that hang on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfer and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year prison sentence after she made classified diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks website public.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance (A matching similarity).
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and pioneering dissident whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office.
Dewey-Hagborg, through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits of what someone might look like with these genomic data, has created a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual commentary not only on the malleability of DNA data – the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations – but also on identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman since her puberty, was convicted in 2013 of 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud, and theft.
Through the prison, her image was suppressed, so much so that there was only one single photo—a grainy, black-and-white selfie in which Manning was visibly uncomfortable sitting in a driver’s seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig—with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette stubs and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to create an image of what these people might look like.
That was when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg said in a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn’t visit at that time and she couldn’t be photographed, so they contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned Muse became unequal letter friends, who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic “Suppressed Images” illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which predicted a future in which President Chelsea would transform his judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would actually demand release of Manning after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas just a few days after the book was published was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There is also something deep and strong now at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, two-way ways to further ignite the rigid divisions that he should actually fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning, with her oversized signature below (the "i" in her family name is endowed with a heart), called for an end to "automatic fragmentation, the basis of which has been gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand footer of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist’s highly developed scientific lexicon) how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
“What people will hopefully take away from this is that our genome doesn’t care who we are and how openly genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are,” said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, can also be seen.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's 30 of those stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in its own room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic novel.
She shows Manning how she shows up with a hands-free phone in her hand from the disciplinary barracks of the United States like King-Kong.
“If they call your speech cold, they’ve won,” he said.
"So never shut up".
“It came straight from a letter she wrote to me,” said the artist, who hails from Philadelphia.
"I still get goosebumps when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person - as was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do so, then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulacs, which gather like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, as was everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Manning's stature), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
“In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd,” Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind her liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford wanted for killing
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee who are being sought as suspects after a man was stabbed in a luxury apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries.
On Monday, warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for murders due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the files of the Cook County District Court show.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stings.
A joint warning system published by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the scene of the incident, and detectives are investigating the stings as a murder, while police are actively searching for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of university relations, said in an email statement that Lathem was now on leave and had been excluded from entering the Northwestern University campus.
“This is now a criminal matter being investigated by the relevant authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation,” Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior treasury assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesperson for the University and Somerville College said in an email statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and willing to help the U.S. investigative authorities in any way possible."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand up.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to stand up to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a puzzling tip, saying something had happened in apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship,” Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza’s management team released a statement to residents: “Police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident.”
"We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it will not take long for the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the timetable, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA timetable has been updated in this regard," Mutko said on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap on compliance with the code, which describes the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization’s website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could give rise to concern for Russia.
“Everything has been announced, everything has been implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA-approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
Regarding the matter, Mutko said, "We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted an error.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programs, and we will not admit anything that does not exist."
Mutko’s words were consistent with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.
Speaking to the Russian sales outlet RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
RUSADA was banned from carrying out doping checks in Russia in November 2015 as a result of the doping scandal by WADA.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is moving “in the right direction” to be reinstated.
Aldi doesn't sell any more eggs for the time being
This was shared by the corporate groups.
It is a purely precautionary measure, it cannot be assumed that there will be any further health impairment, the Communication said.
From now on, only eggs are likely to be delivered to Aldi, who have been proven to have been tested negatively for fipronil-containing anti-solvent.
Aldi wants to bring clarity and transparency to its customers.
The Start-Ups That Will Help Your Business Not Become the Next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the luck of your e-commerce start-up with your employees, but the surveys didn’t work.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful, or even worse, fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
“There was simply never consistency and objectivity,” said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
She called people from outside for help.
A new breed of Human Resources start-ups is growing to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, address special groups and demographic groups, provide employee anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass C-Suite executives and contact the Board of Directors directly.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she gained a better insight into what her employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the Snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a company heat map that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results – so you can drill for why.
Companies come to see that staying at the top of workplace culture doesn’t make you the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee posted a blog post describing an environment of harassment that penalized those who spoke.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion worth in 2020, according to the financial tech website Let’s Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increase in interest and activity earlier this year amid Uber’s fall into disrepute.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convert lets companies send customized “pulse” surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
“The court of public opinion has captured the regulators,” said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of Convercent.
If a company is found to treat its employees badly or behave unethically, it may experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee fluctuation, and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Earlier, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the corporate headquarters, file a formal complaint, and hope he or she was taken seriously.
It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, problems previously hidden from executives sitting in offices in cities or states—such as discrimination, harassment, or dishonest practices—can be identified and addressed more quickly.
“I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience of employment,” said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday’s Risk Management Group.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."
Companies began taking ethics, values, and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations caused by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took until the “social media came to their right” that companies realized that they couldn’t prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
“Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Convert offer your software as a service, and charge companies recurring fees for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.
Glitter secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its entire funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today’s employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes.
Employees want to feel that they are being accepted and appreciated and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission.
“If people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices are heard, and that the work they are doing is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making this company successful,” said Nina McQueen, vice president of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase engagement and employee engagement, it’s no wonder you’ll find support.
The data on employee engagement is important according to the experts of the workplace culture.
But the data is useless if the managers of a company do not take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it can have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if the change doesn’t come fast enough, or at all, it can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.
“When you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.
“For if you don’t follow, employees will ask themselves, ‘Have you really heard me?
Are you taking care of it?
And who you don’t care about, why should I?”
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, Errett said.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize multiple teams within the company through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, adding a communication training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insights about its employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to a better bond between employees in an industry known for high sales.
“If you’re not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you’re going to lose people,” Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers too.
And if you lose customers, you will lose businesses.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It’s 11 p.m. when a lot of UCLA football players are chatting on one side of the team’s new practice fields on campus.
Some have pulled out their jersey tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these idle minutes are a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour practice before returning to the Waterman Football Center at 6:30 a.m. the next morning.
“This is a real treadmill for the boys for the next three days,” Bruins coach Jim Mora said just before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the burden of players, and it has actually extended their days — at least until the finale on Friday.
That’s why the first three UCLA training sessions should start at 7:15 p.m. to meet the players’ already packed schedules.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and performed practical exercises during the summer school for the first time during Mora’s six seasons in Westwood.
They are scheduled to perform 18 exercises in the course of August, 20 before the formal preparations for their start against Texas A&M in September.
Mora said he supports the NCAA’s rule change, even if they add another point to the players’ busy routes.
“We put this enormous burden on them for three or four days, and it’s very challenging,” Mora said.
"And they just pushed it through, they stick around, they're great people.
I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it's going to be really great."
UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished, which will not be an easy task given the clear lines of view of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the upper class that has already been thrown with footballs that provided a safety net behind a goal post.
Bruins players are expected to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there might be a problem once these rooms are free during the season.
“We will use our security,” Mora said.
"That's a real problem, and it's not far fetched to think that people are renting a room there and then setting out there to record an exercise.
If you have the videotape of an exercise, it is a pretty good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces in parking lot 8.
We will do the best we can with what we have.
I'm not too worried about that.
We have a plan.”
Facebook wants to intensify fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake news to third party fact-checkers and then show their results under the original post, said the world’s largest online social network on Thursday. It’s one of its efforts to fight fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to detect possible fake messages and send them to fact checkers who may be showing results of the fact check from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe they also influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters being flooded with false stories ahead of the May presidential elections, and Germany is supporting a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hate-filled postings as they did before the September elections.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-checking will be launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to recognizing what stories are being challenged by third-party fact-checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share,” said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news in a blog post.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the “associated article” and will work on other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
Creating a Comic Novel: A Castle in the History of England
In his recent past, Little Scotney Castle was featured in a squeeze music video and was a slip for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaar Yorkshireman with a fondness for historical documents.
“I think it’s so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who’s been dead for 300 years,” he says.
"What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' spans the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It's not Rhodes' first book based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he unexpectedly found emotionally.
“I just responded to the thumbprint on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins,” he says.
"This is his thumbprint!
And letters always smell of smoke, for at that time a fire was kindled because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if he were also there.
I love archives!”
For someone so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest, I overvalued my welcome a little") this all seems too nice to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, reviewing the archives, and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.
He wandered through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscapers, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "Whiskey and started writing."
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust gained full access only in 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started taking care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said "Oh, throw it to the attic."
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps depicting who possessed what: "One might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to have fought for the two families.
Boys, let everything go its course!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to delve into English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', who follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," Rhodes says.
“The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought a revolt was a good start.
Perhaps the two are connected?”
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit Father, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell is portrayed from the 18th century, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made only years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are the Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite crooks, repeatedly making debts and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women – I imagine them to me as a bunch of good-looking guys, with a talent to promote connections.”
After the end of his engagement in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El<0xC3><0xA4>m<0xC3><0xA4>nm<0xC3><0xA4>ki, the site of an early 20th-century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
“I was sad to go back,” he says.
It was like, "Ah, now I have to deal with the damn life again."
Launched campaign: More than 300-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf
With the unveiling of the 301 year old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand (round-up of Thursday).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret.
At the end of August, there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
"Too nice for us.
Or?", the makers of the action have been asking since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorf Chapel.
"We don't really think that (of course!)," they wrote on their website.
"But we are using this measure to attract your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than they seem.
Basically, we firmly believe that we as Bad Honnefer citizens know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The action is about more than “just” a logo and a slogan, it goes on to say.
"It is appropriate to formulate a stand-alone promise, one that gives the city a distinctive stand-alone feature".
After all, it is in competition with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef can cost a medium five-digit amount to its new umbrella brand and campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Every year at the beginning of August in Ankara, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirement and promotion in the officer corps.
So too this week.
At first glance, a normal process.
But nothing is routine among the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting took place no longer in the building of the General Staff, as before, but in the office of the Prime Minister.
The five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs, chaired by the Head of Government, now also took part in the deliberations.
Thus, the civilians in the YAS were in the majority.
The government is pulling the reins in the military.
Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air forces and the navy were dismissed.
Since the failed coup, head of state Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
Over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army – mostly because of alleged links to the movement of exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the wire-taker of the coup attempt.
Against 486 people who are said to have been directly involved in the coup attempt, negotiations have been held in Ankara since this week.
Already the day after the coup, Erdogan had described the attempted overthrow as a "gift of God" as giving him the opportunity to "completely cleanse the armed forces".
But does Erdogan really control the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Uncomfort in Military Headquarters".
In the General Staff there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which is manifested, among other things, in the lifting of the headscarf ban for soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
In any case, the large-scale clean-up of the army and the security forces continues.
In mid-July, Erdogan ordered a further 7,395 state servants to be fired by decree, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed that Erdogan had tamed the military.
The generals used to be considered the real masters of the country.
Three times they cleaned up, citing their role as guardians of the secular state order.
After his 2002 election victory, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least citing the European Union’s reform targets.
Former officers say Erdogan is deliberately pushing forward an Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe", an unnamed officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad warned that the Turkish army would be "full extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If this is true, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
After the purges, however, there are doubts in the Alliance about the readiness to deploy the Turkish army.
The leadership structures and operational capabilities are “weakened,” say NATO diplomats.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, President Donald Trump said, quoted by the media.
He proposes to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter regulations for obtaining visas for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way citizens from other countries spend Green Cards."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and demonstrate knowledge that will benefit our economy," Trump said, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to renovate track for racetrack shuttle
Over the past few months, there has always been a dispute over the future of the racetrack shuttle – now it is to be done very quickly.
Even before the end of the year, it is planned to build on the maroon track on which the tourist railway runs.
In order to secure the future of the racetrack shuttle in the long term, construction work on the track is scheduled to begin this year, according to the Ministry of Transport.
"With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this connection, which is particularly important for tourism," said Klaus Sühl, Secretary of State for Transport and Tourism, in Erfurt.
The cost of the repair of the route was approximately 2.5 million euros.
Of this sum, the country takes 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future, is currently being finalised, Sühl explained.
The Ministry and the Südthüringen Bahn as operators have already agreed on the technical details.
“This negotiated the timetable, the vehicles used and the quality standards,” said Sühl.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years.
This means that the race ladder shuttle will be ordered regularly in December 2017.
Rennsteig-Shuttle is a popular railway link between Ilmenau and Rennsteig railway stations, especially for tourists.
In recent months, a pilot operation has tested whether the route is used by enough people to order it again regularly in the future.
The route is also heavily structural in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry
Just when you thought it couldn’t get any more crazy in 2017, comes a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots.
Yeah, actually.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, an emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.
“People are making fun of them, but the companies are giving out a lot of them, and we’re going to get to see them much more often,” Mr. Sharkey said in the release of his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm – with conscious human reactions achieved through artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adapt" his robot according to his beliefs, choosing everything from the robot's eye color to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots have the “personalities” that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah", which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventure" personality.
“Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality as possible,” the True Companion website said.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods throughout the day - just like real people!
She can be tired, fixed on conversation, or she can be "in mood"!"
There are many disturbing aspects to this rise of sex robots – not least because they replace real human relationships – but the submissive female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when one steps to frigid (called here: resisting) Farrah, worry one the most.
On his website, True Companion Roxxxy compared with a vibrator, but for men.
“If women (sic) can have a vibrator, then why can’t men have a roxxxy?”
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and their increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men will of course not keep sex robots, and while the FRR notes their increasing popularity, they still remain provisionally at the edge of consumer culture.
But what creeps through from the edge zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in.
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is some overlap, however, that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when women’s rights around the world are under threat, in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted about sexually assaulting women.
The scariest aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the Maid') is not the graphic images, the entwined bodies and the outcast eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it doesn’t feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (although with porn star proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to imitate the movement of a real body.
But, brought to the point when it comes to their "personalities", the robots do not represent real women.
You can’t separate from your companion or just walk away.
They have no mediation or background history, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could interfere with the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are slaves.
Or to put it in the speech of 2017: maid
Trump's big performance?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a hallmark of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the U.S. electorate have also split small-format families.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the United States with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-chosen relatives.
We're all supposed to string up to let our filter bubbles burst.
Less noted is the power of Trump to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has been dealing with the Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kinship she had been fighting for decades for politics, is suddenly and quite strangely on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing for the dining table, but I find it in a further context that this also entails significant risks.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the appalling effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we’re referring to the creepy possibility that one day his kittens won’t repel us.
However, there is an even more terrifying long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes” right-wing Republicans who suddenly appear to be the epitome of reason in comparison to his standards.
Today, I find myself infested with an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney’s hilarious version of the madman – the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) – both of which, compared to Trump, are in fact one of the very mild crimes.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate only needs to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immense improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we brought our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the New York Park department’s carousels, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don’t need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crunchy and the animals twist to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climbing music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines become too familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city does not meet the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large roundabout in northern London.
However, the Central Park carousel is still a strangely magical experience, as here two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40s can go for it and all have a great time.
If I could have rated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but luckily no one asked for it.
On the other hand, this week in a department store, I was forced to evaluate my “experience” with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.
In the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to match the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the counter.
This not only leads to a slowdown in what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required.
The poor woman in the department store stood apologetic grinning while I got tired of the experience of giving her my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred to hospital with chest pain from prison
Pistorius left prison for the second time for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts on his wrists, which, according to prison authorities, he suffered after a fall in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal by prosecutors against a first death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine’s Day 2013 by shooting her several times through a door of the toilet cubicle in his Pretoria home.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nocturnal intruder hiding in the cabin.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to take the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius Appeal, which they say is too lenient.
The National Prosecuting Authority said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the opposition could be heard this year.
Pistorius is in danger of increasing his sentence to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberger schools, the fourth graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen were released into the holidays and into the secondary schools.
Three of the school leavers will go to high school in the future, four to the primary school.
On Tuesday evening, head of school Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen.
As a symbol of school leaving, the 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle that grows up in the chicken farm, but is then released into freedom.
To this end, the cheerful crowd performed a musical entitled "The Eagle in the Chicken Farm".
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg, and had it hatched by his chickens.
Instead of a chicken chick, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making him a chicken was shattered, and the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and escaped.
After that, the classes three and four showed a chicken dance in the study of Yvonne Frank.
The hens danced with the young gamblers who wore cylinders to bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said head of school Angelika Sitte.
The young animal is different from the other young animals (chickens), but belongs to it.
He will never be like a chicken.
His purpose is to be free.
She wished every fourth grader that he felt accepted into his new school.
This was followed by a word of thanks to the colleagues, the former head of the school Michael Müller, who repeatedly intervenes in teaching bottlenecks, and the parents’ representatives.
The chick era is now over, class teacher Sophia Schumacher explained.
After two years of teaching, she is very reluctant to let go of her students, because it was a really great time.
Finally, she was able to rely on the fourth graders.
In the end, all students made a song of summer and holiday time sound.
There was great joy in the children.
Eight first graders have already been registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians Arrested for Illegal Camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by television, said.
On the morning of August 1, a group of illegally enlisting people were arrested in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day, they were released while an investigation is currently underway.
The Foreign Ministry reported to bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control of the free camp and impose considerable fines on anyone found to remain in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
Controls will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Software Update for Diesel Vehicles: What Affected People Need to Know Now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust gas behaviour of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and, in part, Euro 6.
Euro 4 diesel or worse is excluded.
Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives estimates:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the software updates negotiated are voluntary.
“The mandatory updates previously apply only to vehicles that have foaming software,” says Anja Smetanin.
Their retrofit has been ordered by the Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA).
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the coming months, but have not yet announced an exact date.
Daimler has announced that it will write to every affected person.
If an inspection is due anyway, it will be done within their framework.
How long are the conversions expected to last?
“It’s hard to say,” says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as on the political pressure.
“Because we have seen that car manufacturers are not acting voluntarily on the issue of the environment so far.”
How long will the update take?
The conversion itself could only take three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises to wait.
Foreign manufacturers are likely to follow suit, according to Smethanin.
Is there a risk of a massive decline in the price of Euro 4 cars?
The ACE fears this.
But in the regions where driving bans are at risk.
In rural areas, there have been no loss of value for older diesels.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners does not want to come - out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center.
This year, as the cultural institution announced on Thursday, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68), choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honoured.
The awards will be handed over at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and participate in the award together with his wife Melania.
As a result, the award winner Lear, who became known with progressive TV series, has already announced that he will no longer participate in the gala.
The New York Times said: “This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights – to deprive them of even the means – and that burdens me.”
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her point of view.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Former winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city liveable
Roland Wacker, Haslach’s city builder, will retire next year.
The job is already advertised - however, suitable applicants are rare.
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years.
And the work still makes him a lot of fun, as he conveys in the press talk.
He reports on varied, but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that so far no application fulfils the requirement profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.
Thus, taking into account the regular notice periods, there should still be enough time for an initiation.
Since Haslach acts as the Lower Building Rights Authority for the administrative community, the applicant must have corresponding degrees.
Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.
If they could no longer fill it out, the citizens would have to travel to Offenburg for advice.
But close proximity to the city and itself is important, says Wacker, who reports on a good working climate and good mood between authority and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, some important projects have accumulated, which Wacker proudly looks back on.
"We make the city worth living," he is sure of the construction office and its employees.
But also in the future, varied projects are on the agenda: The redesign of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatz, for example, have been initiated.
The Kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, and the stadium renovation is still a topic.
The latter alone will hit the books with around 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right," Wacker estimates.
“All in all, great tasks are waiting for my successor.
The work here is fun."
There is a lot of room for a city builder.
With Haslach’s own construction farm and gardening, a lot of things can be answered quite flexibly.
"You can move a lot," said Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town as an ensemble is protected by monuments, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in" when new buildings are approved, emphasizes the outgoing city builder.
In any case, the city builder bears a great deal of responsibility.
He's the builder, "in the end, everything here runs over my table."
With support and coordination, he can count on long-time employees: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been with him for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Diefbau) for 15 years.
Wacker also wishes his successor to remain for a long time: “We are looking for someone who really wants to identify with the place and stay.”
Continuity is important not only for a good operating climate, but also for the further design of the city.
If you want to inherit Roland Wacker, you should be able to have a completed degree as a graduate engineer or bachelor with a specialization in architecture and have good knowledge in the areas of building regulations and construction planning law.
The municipal building office is subject to construction and civil engineering, construction planning, land acquisition matters, administration of urban properties, municipal farm with construction yard and urban gardening, as well as the Lower Building Rights Authority including monument protection.
Bicycle thrown on lines: South Railway line closed
According to police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railroad crossing in the area of Leobener Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e (B116) on the lines.
These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators are based on two male perpetrators and have been searching for them since the night hours.
Near the scene, a pink-red scooter and bicycle driver had been observed by witnesses.
"This goes far beyond a coup d'état," said <0xC3><0x96>BB spokesman Christoph Posch to the APA.
The perpetrator or the perpetrators would have put themselves at great risk and also jeopardize train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant, as well as the delay minutes and the cost of rail replacement traffic, the rail customers could also be sent to the perpetrators.
Overall, it would be a “significant” sum, the spokesman said.
The damage was remedied on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the southern railway line could be carried out without any obstructions.
Nearly ten passenger trains had failed on Friday morning, two of which involved long-distance transport.
Freight trains did not fail, but they were delayed.
According to <0xC3><0x96>BB spokesman Christoph Posch, about 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million people in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrolling the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not enter the body.
Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.
In experiments, it was found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a particular bacterium in their intestines.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan – one of the building blocks of proteins – to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells.”
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promote more tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal mites when the same system works in humans as well.
Postdoctoral fellow Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that one group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same strain, but which was housed separately, did not.
She suspected that the difference had to do with mice's gut microbiomes - the community of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were DNA sequenced and six bacterial species were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them were missing in the mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked a gut microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells formed.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indol-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice’s feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan secondary products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said: "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high tryptophan levels in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has committed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United, Nemanja Matic has signed a “genius,” according to Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
Chelsea’s <0xC2><0xA3>40 million signature began with a 2:1 win in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the retainer role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira advanced at will.
Matic, however, had been excluded from the Blues' pre-Asian tour and only managed 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
“He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks — he thinks football,” Mourinho said.
"We will help him be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho formed his starting XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" to fulfill three of its four priority new commitments.
"Three out of four, I thank the club for that," he added.
“I’ll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they’ve put a lot of effort into it.”
Boeing "painted" Dreamliner in the sky
U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle, Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette, Michigan, and moved in the form of a dreamliner across the United States, which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screens was the shape of a dreamliner.
The whole thing was a test of endurance for new engines.
Boeing had already done such advertising before.
Thus, the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New deep blow for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
How the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD chief, social democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before the elections.
It was the main wish of the election campaigners that was not just a fire from the party headquarters, but a counter-wind from the federation.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has fundamentally changed.
Since then, employees from the Willy-Brandt-Haus have been watching the events in the SPD-controlled state capitals with growing horror.
What Schulz has gotten from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with counter wind.
They were deep blows.
One by one.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens.
"This shows once again: Red-green simply cannot govern reliably," CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber told the German editorial network (RND).
The surprise resignation of a Green MP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the state election, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from the CDU and the FDP.
The Greens’ Managing Director Michael Kellner has asked the apostate Green MP Elke Twesten to return her mandate.
The transition to the CDU means a clear falsification of the will of the electorate.
Every Twesten has to return its mandate immediately," said the Federal Managing Director and campaign leader of the Greens to the editorial network Germany (RND).
"That must not be true at all," says an SPD campaigner, when the new Hiobs message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is present without a majority of his own government after the Green MPs Elke Twesten transferred to the CDU.
It is the preliminary culmination of a whole series of major and minor crises in SPD national associations.
And no one knows what's coming next.
The miser started with the unexpected clear defeat at the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, nothing more, calmed the comrades at the time.
After the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
And then it got worse, and it all got worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into turmoil, and the Düsseldorf-Pleite smoothed the party.
The comrades struggled again in the weeks after.
Then, when they had just gained new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg.
And with him came the next deep blow.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD head of state, lost his Nimbus that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned.
And because he did pretty much everything wrong in crisis communication afterwards, which can be done wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
Now also Stephan Weil.
Because of the VW exhaust gas deal and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in the spotlight for a long time.
Some polls were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because of this, Weil has been increasingly trying to put accents in the federation in recent weeks.
The ambition of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin was also not hidden from comrades in the vicinity of Martin Schulz.
They allowed him to be granted, as they promised to stabilize the party from Weil.
Now the exact opposite could occur.
Weil is not at all guilty of the party-internal dispute between the Lower Saxon Greens.
And not Schulz at all.
Sometimes the comrades try to keep their own ranks closed.
Their anger is directed at the Greens, and here above all the apostate parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is intolerable and democratically damaging, as Mrs. Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party links in the SPD-Bundestag faction, the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten has been elected to parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate, but through the state list of the Lower Saxon Greens, the Lower Saxon MP continues.
The logical consequence would be that she would return her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD-Bundestag faction, laments an "undemocratic maneuver".
"The will to vote four years ago was clear: people made Stephan Weil prime minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a top candidate in the Bundestag election, to the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU MP distorts the election result," Oppermann said.
He asked to clarify the background.
I want to know if there has been more or if there have been further commitments from the CDU Niedersachsen.
Funding for local centres III
Anyone who wants to renovate their house over the years will soon be able to get support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Stadtentwicklung informed about this on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a look back at what has happened so far.
Since 1991, there have been renovation areas in Empfingen.
At that time, in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount.
In the restructuring area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still at 60 percent.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "success project" - after all, it is important to also promote interior development, and not only to open up new construction areas.
On April 4th, the Karlsruhe government bureau received the information that there will be a redevelopment area III.
The funding amount was EUR 833 333, of which EUR 500 000 came from the country, the rest from the municipality of Empfingen.
How does a redevelopment area come about?
One will, according to Schindler, continue to investigate where the “really old” houses are.
However, it also plays a role in whether there is any interest in the planned area to rehabilitate.
If necessary, the territorial boundaries could then also shift again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the federal-country program "Sociale Stadt", in which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalization of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions, and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out object-related, i.e. per property.
The redevelopment area would eventually be defined as a statute.
The grant period for the grants runs from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
Until September of this year, however, the inventory would first be carried out, within the framework of which the participants in the renovation area will receive a questionnaire to fill out.
In November or December, as far as possible, the articles of association are to be decided so that the renovations can be started in the coming year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations.
It is about assessing the urban maladministration and deciding when and to what extent is being rehabilitated.
A redevelopment notice will then also be entered in the land register for the respective property.
Pietzschmann himself will come to Empfingen again and take a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "Building and Land" which deals with, among other things, the building condition and the renovation intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the "budget and housing" can be made information about the size, division and inhabitants of a living space.
The blue "operational arch" is only to be filled out if business premises are operated in the building.
However, Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not simultaneously an application for funding.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler further emphasized that the distribution of the means of transport works according to the "wind dog principle" - who comes first, grinds first.
You can’t “reserve” funding for later.
Finally, photos of the project "Ortskern II" were shown to make the guests a "tasty" renovation.
British inventor sets himself a microchip to get in the house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so that he can open his front door, enter his office, and even start his car with a hand gesture.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between the thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has teamed up with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consulting anesthesiologist at Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards.
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam’s company also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for an extra charge of <0xC2><0xA3>300 per lock.
The married father of one has now installed both at home and in his BMW Z4 technology, which starts when his hand is at the wheel.
White House advertising costs taxpayers thousands
The White House’s decision to fly a Navy helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000, according to the military, which was handed over to TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17 at the White House with American building programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials took a tour of products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was exhibited alongside a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck, and a Mississippi forklift.
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," the HMX-1 commander wrote on the eve of the event to his superior, the deputy naval commander for aviation.
The news indicated that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on July 17 at around 7 a.m. for the event at 3 p.m., and remained until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House was to be delayed, a second crew would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of the hours of service.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security personnel remained on the ground with the aircraft during the time.
The records made available to TIME did not clearly indicate whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Data records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the determination.
"A question we asked was whether it was a breach of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're locked up," the deputy commander replied.
The "Made in America" event was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave a push for reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he propagated efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But requesting their use only for a photo-op is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the Presidential Plane performed taxi services against the backdrop of its first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of reports complaining about the use of the Presidential Plane by its predecessor.
"The White House is thrilled by the show "Made In America" - which showcases products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials," White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters said.
HMX-1 crews often conduct training flights in the Washington and South Lawn area to drop the US president in the White House with precise centimetres.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 exercise landings at the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted in the training requirement of the flight crew for the month, an official said.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions".
The White House said taxpayers took the burden for none of the other props presented at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to U.S. Department of Defense hourly rates for the 2017 financial year, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate.
“Determining the costs for taxpayers based on the estimates for refund rates is highly misleading,” Walters said.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance, and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include the personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract closure.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the helicopter’s use for the event.
“The idea is to present things that are made in America this week,” Spicer said.
And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands, of people depend on it.
And I think like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly for.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight that.”
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver’s seat of a fire truck.
At the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss before tricky task
Leading runner-up of the Second Tennis Bundesliga will compete in the third-tier Suchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will arrive in Kiel tomorrow from 11 a.m. at the table third Suchsdorfer SV.
Despite five games of still immaculate record, the leader of the Second Tennis Bundesliga has retained the sense of reality.
Team leader Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation.
Especially in the back positions, I think the team is very good."
For class and stability at the Suchsdorfer SV, especially the imports from the high north ensure.
Their Danes and Finns can even point to bets in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in doubles,” says Zay with a view of Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
“As always, it’s going to be hard for us.
You also need a good portion of happiness.”
The Neusser team for the trip to the high north is practical.
His debut for blue and white could be Maxime Janvier.
If the currently active French player in the Italian Biella Challenger tournament is not able to attend the Bundesliga party, the Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic) playing at the tournament in Liberec (Czech Republic) will come to his first place this season.
The previously undefeated Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was on the ball yesterday with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevsky at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel.
However, he was to be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagna.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster, M<0xC3><0xA1>té Valkusz could also return to the team.
If it’s not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was still the number one junior world ranking in January 2016, someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay fills up the squad.
How America Can Hurt the OMV
Really, Donald Trump didn’t work when he signed the law tightening sanctions against Russia on Wednesday night.
“In his haste to pass the law,” Congress packed in a few “unconstitutional regulations,” he said.
The reaction from Moscow was also as sharp as expected, and even Brussels was foaming against the US push.
After all, the draft proposes to punish European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Investors from the local OMV, which co-finances the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea pipeline Nord Stream 2 together with other European companies, have been thus troubled since then.
The threat is huge.
Nevertheless, it is too early for an estimate of the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil company.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
Twelve weapons are available to him.
"The press" has looked at which the group could defend and which could really hurt him.
Narco's Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will be the focus of Netflix's hit series
Despite the second season of Narcos, which reveals Pablo Escobar’s killer, Netflix’s series is far from over.
Season three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first received their first trailer and showed the show's latest villains.
With the third season, the DEA has focused its attention on the richest organization of the world’s drug trade: the Cali cartel.
Led by four powerful patrons, they operate “like a Fortune 500 company” only with more government bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a, the type who invites American and Colombian law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Role backwards: The city hires 46 kitchen helpers
The city organizes the Kita lunch table again itself.
With permanent contacts for the children and an assignment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the city’s daycare centers.
As of 1 September, the city of Krefeld will take over the food supply in the municipal day care facilities (Kitas) again in its own right.
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Head of the Department of Youth Aid, this is a good news: "We were all very happy".
Cooked is still out of the house: a caterer takes over this task and supplies freshly cooked chilled.
The city operates 46 day care centres in the Krefeld area, and in 44 children receive a warm meal at lunchtime.
In the past year, 2,800 children were sitting at the tables, and the demand is growing steadily.
“In the meantime, not only children who are cared for 45 hours a week eat in the Kita at lunchtime,” Pommeranz explains.
"The offer is also valid in 35-hour care if children stay until 2pm."
46 part-time workers will have kitchen service from 1 September: they will heat the delivered food, supplement it with salad, raw food and fruit, portion the meal individually, dispense the food, clean, rinse and clean the kitchen.
“Employees are permanently assigned to a kita,” says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - decides on the length of the hour.
“The kitchen helpers are now firmly part of the Kita team,” says Pommeranz satisfied.
"So they are much more involved and it is easier for the kita management to implement pedagogical concepts".
This is also about healthy eating and cooking lessons.
"The children should help to prepare the food".
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense.
Also for the children.
“They have a known power in the Kita, a person who is familiar with them, and not constantly changing people.”
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the kita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has not only the quality improvement of kitchen performance, but also the charm that it has proven to be the most economical in comparison to the cost between its own direction and external allocation for the city, according to the press office.
And that, although 46 part-time workers are reset.
“But these hours are not so important for around 750 people in the education sector,” says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the United Nations mission, said hundreds of women will run in provincial council elections, three women running for the role of vice president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
“The role of women cannot be overestimated,” he said in a statement Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are included in all parts of the election process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections will take place on April 5.
The Taliban have released threats against an election process that coincides with the transition from international combat to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will peacefully pass power from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will further strengthen Afghanistan’s democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women from a total of registered 3.6 million voters are registered.

Men try to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 are said to have attempted to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police information, the men called the 13-year-old who was staying with friends on Kolpingstra<0xC3><0x9F>e at around 2.55 p.m. because they wanted to make a phone call with the girl’s phone.
The 13-year-old refused the request and went on with her friends.
Then one of the perpetrators tried to grab the girl’s phone and necklace, but failed.
Without a gun, the duo fled.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
The investigation is ongoing.
GMB concern about investments in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A trade union wants to make sure that managers of the Biskuit manufacturer McVitie have a long-term commitment to production at their Glasgow plant.
GMB Scotland said the company has been silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work at the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies in addition to other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in recent years.
He added that employees and union representatives would "experience first" if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB urged Scotland McVitie's to "state concerns that funding for the modernization of production lines is not being pushed forward".
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy said, “The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the general site manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross deeply affects our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is strongly focused on the local community and Greater Glasgow, an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, from the perspective of jobs, wages and wealth, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising living costs and chronic production decline, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving production presence at McVitie."
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: “The branch manager at Tollcross just received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will respond directly to this as we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and union representatives.
Two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with the employees that, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our business – and this applies to all our business areas and locations – in order to remain competitive.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in our Tollcross site, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize the legacy of Tollcross as a production facility. Should our operations change at the site, the employees and their union representatives will be the first to learn about this."
Did the PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about Neymar?
La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not slow down in her pursuit of Neymar after she made an offer of <0xC2><0xA3>189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of the world record assault?
The sensational approach has fueled the transfer window in the summer, as the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United last season for <0xC2><0xA3>89 million.
After completion, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest-paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 per week.
Barcelona is angry at the way Neymar forced his way outside, although a source close to the Catalan board insists that the club has always done its best to take care of him since arriving from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned about this prospect by the PSG president three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of PSG’s best players.
“I’m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will stand in opposition to them, we will contact their players,” Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to have one of our players sign with them, it will have consequences.”
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their pricing offers for Neymar.
Roller overturned and damaged
On the night of Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately overturned a scooter parked in Königsfelder Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e in front of the property number 30 and thus caused property damage of over 200 euros to the cladding of the vehicle.
Police Schramberg, phone 07422/ 27 01-0, asks for information.
Police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
Because a car came to him on his way, the driver of a VW Touran had to evade and touched the steering wheel.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum with his VW was on the B 215 from Stolzenau heading towards Leese.
In the area around Stolzenau, a car came to him on his lane, so he had to deviate to the right.
The Touran driver touched the guide bar.
There was damage to the car.
The driver of the arriving car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident.
According to the accident victim, it may be good that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police now ask witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the car to contact the Commissioner in Stolzenau under tel. 05761/92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen Report Relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Cathedral Palace report on the abuse cases relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger.
This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann means.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Cathedral Palaces continues to provide discussions.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church", explained after publication to the German Press Agency, he expects an apology from the former Bishop of Regensburg and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as from the cathedral chapel master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI.
It would be very useful for the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret over their own omissions or their misjudgement at the time.
On the other hand, the Vatican newspaper “Osservatore Romano” criticised the fact that reporting on violence in the cathedral palaces was measured with “two measures”.
With regard to the raids in Regensburg, no one doubts that these are "shameful and shameful acts" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation" is striking, according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee.
“The habit of calling the Catholic Church a source of all evils is already part of the everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal,” Scaraffia writes.
Princess Gloria von Thurn and Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischen Rundfunk: "You like going to church and this is a food found".
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth, “beats have been a normal educational tool” to “get along with naughty children, as I was one of them.”
They found it unfair to apply today’s standards to earlier decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports of the abuse cases, Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
Completely wrong, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the memoir "My Brother of the Pope" with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly is the 440-page report submitted by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, appointed by the Bishop of Regensburg, with the clarification?
Between 1945 and the early 1990s, a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were "with high plausibility" victims of assaults, 67 Domspatzen were sexually abused.
Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, said: "To sum up, it can be stated that in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence were used by Domkapellmeister R...
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe.
Nevertheless, contrary to numerous other accused, it is evident that many victims appreciated R.’s general humanity and therefore in numerous cases even connect positive memories with him despite violence.”
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg cathedral palaces, Georg Ratzinger, is in his opinion relieved.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence against protected persons at the Regensburg cathedral palaces" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students highlight his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who has often become tangible when a domspatz musically did not bring top performance.
How do you view this final report as your biographer?
Michael Hesemann: If you make the effort and read the entire 440-page report from front to back, you have to wonder why the name Georg Ratzinger is actually in it.
He is only eight pages dedicated to him, and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of co-defendant or co-consciousness in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The excesses of violence at preschool also occurred outside of its sphere of action.
One can at least accuse him of having learned too late or not taking first hints seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was felt by practically all respondents as - so literally - "redemption", "heaven" and "better world".
For example, the vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, is a very excellent witness, describing him as "warmhearted", "popular", "sincere", "competent" and "comprehensive", as an extremely good-natured teacher, who regularly provided the boys with cakes, cookies and candy and was "always surrounded by grapes of children".
Only a minority complain about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which once led to outbursts of anger.
The fact that he not only banged with chairs and threw the keychain on the floor, but also drew ear figs and all too cheeky guys to the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.
However, in order to save his honour, it must be said that such methods of education were widespread in the 1960s and 1970s, among parents and teachers.
Do you know any such methods?
Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.
I also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.
Compared with what this report is actually about, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence in pre-school, these are, of course, bagatelles.
Then one wonders if it is not more about his familiarity and his role as the brother of Benedict XVI that many media have fallen on him right now.
Many who have never understood him are still zealously working on the Bavarian Pope.
But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!
The media reported a great deal in connection with the report on abuse in the Regensburg cathedral palaces.
Will Georg Ratzinger also be charged with any involvement or cognizance of sexual abuse in the final report?
Michael Hesemann: Absolutely no.
None of the 67 victims of sexual assault claim to have entrusted themselves to the Domkapellmeister.
Not even the parents were inaugurated.
"I never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it," said one affected person, representing the others, "it was all very embarrassing to me."
The real problem with the education of sexual abuse was, and still is, that most victims remain silent out of shame.
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in a professional way.
How do the Domspatzen students evaluate Ratzinger’s role in the abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: A student in question put it this way: "In terms of sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.
I consider it ... also to be really absurd to assume that he ... has opened up more penetrating, clearer, or even more so than to their parents, boarding instructors, trust teachers, etc.
That you talk to him about sex ... - inconceivable."
Thus, the report comes to the very clear conclusion: "The fact that the pupils concerned and/or their environment were entrusted to him in advance could not be confirmed within the framework of the investigation".
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore to be released from any cognizance.
Nor can he be accused of not having prevented or brought to the notice.
Therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these disgusting crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media, there was much of "violence" in the Regensburg cathedral palaces.
The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "Wegschauen".
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that in reporting everything has been mixed and mixed into a huge mix of sexual abuse and violence excesses and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that is an abuse of the report.
There is a clean separation: between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence excesses, and, let’s say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, i.e. also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir leader of the Domspatzen.
All the terrible beating pedagogy, the cases in which boys were harassed and maltreated by sadistic teachers and suffered appallingly, all occurred at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where truly scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he only got to see the boys when they were already in the Domspatzengymnasium.
On this, as the vast majority of witnesses emphasize, the topic of "preschool" was taboo.
One was only happy to have escaped her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.
What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was already discipline, but no sadistic violence.
And the same is true for Georg Ratzinger, where the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even connect positive memories with him despite violence".
At the very least, this is the accusation of having looked away.
However, despite all the efforts, the report was only able to define two periods in which it was reported of the conditions at preschool.
The first time in 1970/71, when he was just beginning to establish himself, and from the events at a school where he did not work and was responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then only again around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears to the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because as early as 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In it, he points out that "the beating penalty will continue to be practiced in pre-school".
Even in the face of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when punitive penalties were long banned even in Bavaria.
Before that, they happened in a legal gray area, as we all know.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where the victims might have been exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded.
But you can't say he'd always looked away.
That's just not true.
It was only in 1980 that the beating penalty at schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today’s educational standards to that time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "falling trick of anachronism", that is, the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards.
The princess is right.
But this does not apply, of course, to sexual abuse, which was abhorrent at all times, nor to what was broken in the pre-school of reluctance and violence against innocent children’s souls, which goes far beyond what was then common.
It’s all terrible and I’m glad it’s finally being reworked.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, i.e., pulling ear-fingers and hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then banned, he also strictly adhered to it.
What picture of his Regensburg era has Georg Ratzinger reproduced in the talks with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?
Did the subject of punitive punishment also come into play?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective that the cathedral pats played only a secondary role.
Nevertheless, I do not deny that he led a strict regiment there.
But this must also be said: without this perfectionism, without the insistence of absolute discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world rank from the formerly nationally known Regensburg Cathedral Paths, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the United States (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With cookies and bonbons alone, one makes out of rebellious boys no great singers and stands before every success, no matter in which field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
What kind of person have you seen Georg Ratzinger talking about her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I have met Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced again and again as wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply faithful and good-hearted people, from whom one cannot imagine that he could do anything even one fly.
I regularly get along with how many former domspats still today, 23 years after his emeritus, keep in touch with him regularly, visit him, read to him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.
Those who do not forgive him to this day that he was once strict with them are therefore clearly in the minority.
Most of the domspats are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing the world of music to them.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, sure, that may be - but also a lovable respecter, to whom they still look up today and whom they worship.
And please, again very clearly: all that is accused of him are methods of education that were on the agenda at the time.
We can be glad that we have overcome this time.
But it is highly unjust to make a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother, a media scapegoat.
The evil intention behind it is all too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published relieves him.
Now the decency would be to leave a 93-year-old man who has gained great merit and without whom outside Bavaria and perhaps even Germany probably no one would know the Regensburg cathedral palaces, finally in peace.
