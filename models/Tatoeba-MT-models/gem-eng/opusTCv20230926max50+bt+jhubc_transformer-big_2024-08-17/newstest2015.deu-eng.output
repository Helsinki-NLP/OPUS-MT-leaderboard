The Prime Ministers of India and Japan met in Tokyo.
India’s new Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in Toko on his first important foreign visit since his May election victory to discuss economic and security policy relations.
Mr. Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic relations with the third largest economic nation in the world.
Plans for stronger nuclear cooperation are at the top of the agenda.
According to reports, India also hopes for a treaty on defence cooperation between the two nations.
Karratha Police Arrest 20-Year-Olds After Fast Motorcycle Hunt
A motorcycle was confiscated after the driver drove it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through bushland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic police officers in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after watching it as it left a gas station on Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
Police report that the driver then ignored the holding signals and drove on Burgess Road before heading off to the bushland, where officials lost sight of it.
The motorcycle as well as a person who corresponded to the description of the driver were later seen at a house at Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
Karratha police accuse a 20-year-old man of failing to observe a hold signal and reckless driving.
He is due to appear before the District Court in Karratha on September 23.
The motorcycle was secured and confiscated for three months.
George Webster charged with hotel rape in Naim and Pitlochry
A man stands trial for the rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read in a hearing of the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of raping a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, on June 7, 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she was "unconscious, asleep, and could not signal consent."
Webster is also accused of raping a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim, Scotland, on 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the hearing date for November 17 at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Reflecting on the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have tabled a bill to establish the organization of trade unions as civil rights.
“Just as unions die, middle-class jobs also die,” said Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat and deputy chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
Therefore, I proudly present the Employee Empowerment Act together with the civil rights icon John Lewis.
This ground-breaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities for discrimination because of the organization of trade unions as for other forms of discrimination – and thus stops anti-union forces.
Supplementing the National Labour Law Act to create an opportunity for workers exposed to discrimination to organize a union representation, to sue before a civil court for justice – and to receive damages or penalties – is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it’s certainly not a radical initiative – at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill suggest is to connect back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks that unions have been exposed to in recent years – in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country – Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand and uphold labour rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that the militarized autocracy of Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
In full awareness that the workers and their unions played a role in creating a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly acknowledged that "the rights of workers to union and common bargaining and action are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler’s fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organize themselves and raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans inserted a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to establish associations to secure and improve working and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and every profession or trade.
Agreements that restrict or aim to reduce this right are null and void; measures aimed at it are unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Commission on Human Rights, from which the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was designed, as adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a worldwide agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors included a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or join trade unions to protect his interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries on how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to establish a union – and that this union should then participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government agencies – should be protected.
After these rights have come under fire in America, it is indeed very wise to re-examine the American ideal, according to which the working population must have the right to unite and to be heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
The story is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the workers’ movement did not limit the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the standard of living of millions of people, work has miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History remembers, and so should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' representatives - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing the ideals that have made America great in the past and fulfilled the promise of democracy.
Judge suspends temporary law that could force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to close
A U.S. federal judge provisionally stopped implementing a law in Louisiana on Sunday, which lawyers say would have probably led to the closure of all five abortion clinics in the state.
This measure, which was brought into law by Bobby Jindal, governor of Louisiana, in June and is expected to come into force on Sept. 1, would force doctors carrying out abortions to acquire a patient admission right at a hospital within a 30-mile radius to their practice.
However, the judge’s decision means that doctors may continue to carry out legal abortions for the time being while applying for such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue to work in accordance with the law while striving to obtain these rights," Federal Judge John deGravelles wrote in his ruling.
Within a month, a hearing will be held for the judge to bring about a more permanent decision for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of rulings against similar measures, and said doctors were thus spending more time to gain hospital admission rights.
"Today's decision means that the women in Louisiana are avoiding a deplorable law that wants them to take their health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, president and chairman of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which had sued on behalf of three of the state's five clinics to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also extended to doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the complaint and had also applied for enrolment rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have passed similar laws, with courts recently declaring such measures in Alabama and Mississippi unconstitutional.
Key points of a Texas law that would have forced most of the clinics remaining in the state to close were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, agree that admission rights require unnecessary restrictions from doctors.
Anti-abortionists hold back from the fact that the measures serve to protect women’s health, although some also welcomed the effects of closing clinics.
Only a doctor who carries out abortions in Louisiana has patient identification rights, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all the other doctors in the state are forced to stop carrying out abortions, this doctor would no longer perform the operation for fear of his safety, the group said.
In their argument against the ruling, Louisiana State officials said they would not punish doctors for carrying out abortions, while their applications for patient identification rights would still be pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates from ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video tribute to their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
For women in rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, and found that only 25 percent were still alive five years after diagnosis.
Research director Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state, the mortality risk during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
SMALL STUDY: New Medicines Could Slow Lung and Ovarian Cancer
The researchers studied the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, pre-existing diseases, and social and economic status also influenced the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer had already progressed at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was lowest.
For those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state, the mortality risk during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers than possible factors for it.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are mostly found in larger cities," she said.
Despite improving telemedical services to counter the distances, she proposed as a possible remedy an enhancement of the service of in-flight doctors to give specialists the opportunity to provide women closer to their place of residence, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said the study showed a poor long-term survival rate in women in ovarian cancer regardless of geographic status and underlined the need for better treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old mother from the Gold Coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret declining homeowner numbers
The decline, along with an increased decline in the number of homeowners under the age of 35, could cause garden centers to lose tens of thousands of pounds a year if today’s young consumers reach the “nuclear age group for garden products,” according to a study by the HTA, as reported in the Financial Times.
The report states that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that people with a home spend on their garden.
The rise of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular method of paving out front gardens for park purposes, and the declining garden size are other factors that threaten the industry, in which an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>5 billion annually are implemented in sales.
In the Greater London area, where the share of homeowners has fallen from 61 to 43 percent over a period of 6 years, the lowest expenditure for garden products per household is mentioned.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that living for rent or small gardens does not mean that people cannot plant.
Guy Barter, chief gardener for the RHS, said: “Container gardeners are very popular with tenants, for example, because they can take their plants with them in a move.”
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden retail trade due to rising home ownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also forecasted an improved market situation for this year due to better weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan led by opposition politician Imran Khan and cleric Tahirul Qadri continues.
In the capital, Islamabad, around 1,000 protesters have stormed the state-run TV station PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said soldiers could have pushed the protesters out of PTV buildings again.
The transmitter stopped its operation for about 40 minutes, but now retransmits.
At the same time, around 3,000 demonstrators tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About a kilometre away, they provided themselves with sticks and stones equipped clashes with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The protesters demanded Sharif's resignation, but he refused.
Meanwhile, the country’s army is calling for a political solution to the conflict, “to waste no time and apply without violence.”
After a meeting at the headquarters on Sunday evening, the military said: "The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state".
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already been cleaning up more frequently.
Opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Prime Minister Sharif of cheating in the May parliamentary election last year.
The protests escalated on the weekend after Khan and Qadri called on their supporters to advance to Sharif’s residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey orders US diplomat for espionage report
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has ordered the country’s most senior U.S. diplomats to provide information on a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said the U.S. embassy and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that those of former U.S. National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden show that Turkey was a major area of activity for U.S. and British intelligence.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report and said all major countries were spying on each other.
An earlier report, which also targeted Germany’s most important intelligence agency, caused much more angry reactions by the Turkish government.
Warning Strike: Drivers Threaten with Consequences for Commuters
The national warning strike of the train drivers on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The exhibition, announced for 18 to 21 o’clock, concerns all transport companies throughout Germany, including long-distance, regional and S-Bahn traffic,
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight traffic.

The chairman of the German Locomotive Leader (GDL) union, Sven Schmitte, said in Düsseldorf.
We expect significant outages.
There is no regional focus.
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight traffic.
Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced it would do everything possible to keep the impact as low as possible.
However, the GDL did not say where it wanted to strike, so it was difficult to predict the consequences in concrete terms.
Magaluf Police Chief Accused of Corruption
On Friday, prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvi<0xC3><0xA0> to the Office of the Prosecutor of Mallorca.
The head of Calvi<0xC3><0xA0> police on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after corruption charges by businessmen and bar owners in the notorious binge drinking hot spot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was arrested after corruption charges against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most bars and nightclubs of Magaluf are located.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvi<0xC3><0xA0> to the Office of the Prosecutor for the Suppression of Corruption of Mallorca on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the corruption allegations and are questioned by a judge together with Navarro.
The national Spanish daily ABC reported that the angry nightclub sitters said the government’s vet economy had a serious impact on their businesses.
“It’s no longer about making money, it’s about survival,” one of the businessmen told the court.
Leave our livelihood out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist performing on 24 men during a Suuftour Fellatio.
The island authorities have since tried to stop the misbehavior of alcoholic holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the infamous alcohol-drinked pub tours.
The Playhouse Club, where the Fellatio incident took place, was forced to close for one year, while Playhouse and the pub tour organizer Carnage jointly have to pay a penalty of €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is especially popular with young British holidaymakers, is also known for several accidents under the influence of alcohol, including the trend of "balconing", where people jump from one balcony to another or from one balcony into the hotel pool.
First Spring Day with Wet and Stormy Weather Conditions Affected Flights from Adelaide Airport
FR<0xC3><0x9C>HLING has given South Australia a wintery surprise, with heavy showers and strong winds that affected flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 9 p.m. another 5mm rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already fallen on the night to Sunday.
The last precipitation was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a casting that began just before 8 p.m. and caused almost 4mm of precipitation in about 10 minutes.
After the winter had taken care of an early dose of spring last week, the temperatures in the city fell again to a maximum of only 15.8°C on Monday.
The inclement weather conditions have probably led to the delayed landing of a flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 7.30 p.m., but was hit by a shear wind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to start through.
Wind surges at this time reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the aircraft had to start through on a second landing and finally set up at about 8:40 p.m.
The flight delay resulted in the delay of some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, Tuesday is forecast to have a maximum temperature of 16°C, with possible showers.
Matthies thinks: High time for great networking
Given the galloping technical progress that threatens to turn our comfortable home into high-tech switchboards, our columnist Bernd Matthies consoles himself with an extremely familiar electronic accessory.
As I write this, my look falls on the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I think: Boah, how retro is that?
But there is a thought behind this: if the cable were not, all the listeners would fly around the house in no time, and that would be much more retro.
Is it in the Ekeltronic (Ekeltronic)?
No, typo: electronic) sector the rule that the world novelty of today is the electric scrap of tomorrow, bought - obsolete.
And if, for example, you still have a tube TV in your living room today, you simply say that you reject television in principle.
Why these considerations?
Because pushing the Ifa on the radio tower this week again shows us our absolute incompetence on issues of electronics.
The layman, who used to blindly master the washing machine and CD player, today does not even understand the purpose of the devices, which are spread out in front of him with unimaginably vain expert speech: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press office.
Yeah, is that okay?
What should you talk about with people who seem to voluntarily spread such quarks?
Basically, for about 20 years, it has been mainly about the fact that we should be able to connect our house.
So that the yoghurt itself reorders, so that the fire alarm tells us on holiday in the Maldives that it is burning in the study room.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we went from the office air conditioning to our soon arrival...?
Yes, this requires air conditioning.
But a dream will soon come true: we will lift our wristwatch, say to her, "Saugen!" - and at home the vacuum robot will start.
Irre.
Everything runs out of nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods are blurring", an industry expert says, you can connect the washing machine with a headphone, the steamer sends the weather report and the data glasses shows how long the pizza in the oven still needs, but nothing useful because we are stuck.
From everyday practice, we also know that when a new-fashioned device is really urgently needed, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
Another reason for this is that the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after spending the summer in air shelters, while rocket and mortar shelling on their communities collapsed during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools in Gaza remained closed while the area recovered from the fighting.
The start of school brought a sense of joy and expectation to the communities in southern Israel, marked by missile-insurance holes, but the signs of fighting are still fresh.
In the southern town of Ashdod, employees of the "Pashosh" kindergarten, hit by a rocket, removed grenade splinters from the walls and sliding walls before students arrived.
“We’re a little scared, but excited,” said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher.
Many children in our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it feels "a bit weird" to suddenly go back to school.
“These were difficult times, and we didn’t leave the house at all,” she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a cease-fire broke out last week, thousands of residents of the border communities, such as Saad, stayed in their homes or left their homes to move to safer areas further away from Gaza and escape the rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the Gaza border where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade, are still reluctant to return.
The Ministry of Education said about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily housed in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a border town in Gaza that is heavily marked by Palestinian shelling.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said "we will make sure that their knowledge acquires and offer you security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire caused an immediate end to the fighting; however, important problems remain unresolved, such as Hamas’s demand for a lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel calls for the disarmament of Hamas and the surrender of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin this month in Egypt.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies this information and estimates that at least half of those killed were fighters, but did not provide any concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including one Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar shells during the fighting on Israeli cities, most in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza area and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools that were converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in shelters and continue fighting, last week’s education authorities postponed the start of the school year.
"I hope the school will be reopened soon so that we can continue to learn, just like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
After election in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl calls into question NPD ban proceedings
In view of the vote losses of the NPD in Saxony, CDU federal vice-president Thomas Strobl has voted for an end to the ongoing NPD ban proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to CDU Federal Vice Thomas Strobl, the ongoing ban proceedings against the NPD should come to an end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD is cutting worse than last time," Strobl, who is also the CDU head of state in Baden-Württemberg, told the "Leipzig Volkszeitung".
This is a pleasing development in the right direction and a development that leads me to the conclusion that the NPD is being fought politically rather than before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD had almost failed at the five percent hurdle in the vote on Sunday.
A first call for a ban on the far-right party had failed in 2003 because constitutional protection at the time also had informants at the NPD's head.
In December 2013, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe after long preparation.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
At Neul<0xC3><0xA4>nder Platz, refugees are now housed in tents.
The headquarters first reception for refugees in Harburg bursts out of all seams.
Now the interior authority has set up three tents of the Red Cross next to it.
The district politicians were informed shortly before - they are not very enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck actions further fuel citizens' reservations and do not give district politicians the opportunity to contribute constructively to the humane housing of refugees," said Britta Herrmann, chairman of the Greens' group at the Harburg District Assembly.
Her party demands that the Harburg district administration currently provide unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
Reasons for overcrowding in the initial admission are the rush of aid seekers - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore stay longer than the regular three months.
House prices have experienced the strongest winter rise in seven years, according to a widely-observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, according to RP data from Monday.
As a result of this increase, the total increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data’s research director, Tim Lawless, said Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two-way market.
RP Data figures show that house prices in Sydney rose by 16.1 percent last year, while in Melbourne they rose by 11.7 percent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which was hit hard by the cuts in government spending and where prices rose by only 1.4 percent over the year.
Mr Lawless went on to say that with the beginning of spring, an increase would now be observed in the properties for sale for the next few months, which would undergo the market "a real test".
“If you look at the continuously high rate of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate, and the continuously low interest rate environment, it’s likely that home prices will continue to rise in the next three months,” he said.
In a statement to the New Press, he contradicts statements made by the Managing Director Peer Medau and attests to him posing "like a commander".
This is not the style of the university, it says.
Thus, the Medau family had already been informed orally about the hiring of the university in mid-June.
The statement that the plans only became known in July is definitely wrong," said Pötzl.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "preconceptions or even decisions", but there are "preferentials".
The expansion of the narrow road up to the castle, which is necessary for access, is also less dramatic than feared by the Medaus.
There was and is not the talk of a nine-metre-wide street.
It is at the current level of 5.50 meters, which is one meter wider than before," explains Pötzl.
The argument of the Medau operators that their free and school-like parking spaces will then only be used by students of the university in the future, does not want to let Pötzl apply.
Parking is not allowed at all, because this can now be solved intelligently as with other public parking spaces.
Think of the locals
The children's crib Bergwichtel, which is located on the grounds and at the front door of which the access to the parking deck would lead, is "not to be affected", according to the university president.
Rather, it should be borne in mind that "this is not only about the nursery, but also about the residents at the entrance to Friedrich-Strib-Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e and the 800 pupils of the neighbouring real school.
So it’s about much more than the particular interests of Mr. Medau,” says Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the parent advisory board of the children's crib, with the expansion of the street would be "lost one of the few natural spots of Coburg", "the reader can decide for himself".
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the State Building Office Bamberg, wants to inform the city councils about the construction development of the university by 2020 "and in this context address the importance of the new development".
Last week, Peer Medau informed the parents of the nursery school about the plans of the university.
Accordingly, the access for the new parking deck should not be via the campus and the Friedrich-Strieb-Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e, but via the Medau-Berg.
This means that the narrow road would have to be expanded in two lanes over a distance of about one kilometer.
According to the Medaus calculations, traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle would thus increase tenfold.
There are about 2,000 vehicles per day.
From the side of the city, they did not want to comment on the project until now.
Glandorf resigns from national handball team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old from the Federal Leagueist SG Flensburg-Handewitt cited health problems in particular for this decision.
I didn't make the decision lightly, it's matured for several months.
It’s time for me to listen to my body’s signals and finish my career in the national team,” the 2007 World Champion said on his Facebook page.
With a record of 167 international matches and 576 goals for Germany, he is thus going into international retirement.
Because the throwback player wants to go on goal hunting for the Champions League winner from Flensburg for a few more years, he is now no longer available to the new coach Dagur Sigurdsson.
Glandorf had a long and good conversation with Icelander, who announced his squad for the international matches against Switzerland on Tuesday.
His ideas and approaches have impressed me just as much as they will inspire my long-time co-players and successors.
But for my club I also want to be available healthy in the next few years, which requires longer regeneration breaks that do not allow the current double load.
The left-hander had to fear his career end in 2012 after a heel infection.
Due to Achilles tendon problems, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Federation (DHB) with a cortisone syringe, which later triggered a strong inflammation.
An emergency operation and two other interventions followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career do not pass by any body without a trace.
I have some health building sites that I can no longer ignore.
After the three infection-related foot surgeries that took place in 2012 at short intervals, I never really got my blood pressure under control.
This includes some other wear-related complaints.
Already at the beginning of the year, I noticed that while I control my head, I can’t fool my body,” Glandorf told Handball Time magazine in an interview.
He would only be ready for a comeback in an absolute emergency.
“When all the knitting is done, I’m always ready to talk,” the two-time family father told the magazine.
However, I can count the years in which I can still play handball by one hand.
I also have to say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I have also become quite humble in terms of my health.
After my career, I want to be able to go at least to some extent.
In addition to the 2007 World Cup title and winning the 2014 Champions League, he won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012, he also won the European Cup of Cup Winners with Flensburg.
German economy shrinks by 0.2 percent in spring
The crises around the globe slowed the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product fell by 0.2 per cent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
This was communicated by the Federal Statistical Office and confirmed provisional calculations.
Consumption alone boosted the economy in the spring, while investment declined.
Foreign trade also slowed down the economy.
Thanks to the strong start-up of the year, a total GDP increase of 0.8 percent for the first half of the year compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the "Münsterland-Mooiste", which led through the Burgmannsstadt for the first time on Sunday.
The Burgmannstadt Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "fietsenfahrer" on Sunday.
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste".
This is the largest bike tour across Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
Over 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for organizing this tour of Münsterland with their registration.
This tour was offered to interested parties in various specialist journals.
We came from Den Helder and drove overnight to participate in this tour.
We would like to get to know the Münsterland in this way as well," the cyclists were happy about the route through the districts of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration in the club home of the Schützenbroderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace trip" through the city over the wall, where the start took place.
Further, the route, which was advertised for three different categories, headed for Herrenholz via Schöppinger Berg towards Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometers with 1175 meters of altitude, 120 kilometers with 1475 meters of altitude and 145 kilometers with 1775 meters of altitude, cyclists proved their good condition.
They were cared for on the way in Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
Main organizer Jos ter Huerne and mayor deputy Heinz Lölfing were very pleased with the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a nice experience for all involved.
The organization went without any problems and there were no negative incidents," Heinz Lölfing drew a positive conclusion from this event.
Unfortunately, not as many participants came as the organizer had hoped, which was probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We will see each other again in 2015 in hopefully beautiful weather on August 30 or during another weekend," the cyclists promised to return to Münsterland and the organizers are planning a new edition.
Konstantin Wecker's ruthlessly honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which has brought Konstantin Wecker, songmaker, pacifist, political activist, ex-prisoner, to paper on 287 pages.
The Munich-born Municher, born on 1 June 1947, wrote his memoirs, each chapter initiated by a suitable song text.
And he’s quite honest: From masturbation as a high school student to shoplifting and drug use, he doesn’t leave out any human weakness.
Also, to show how he himself learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Wide space also includes abstract but all the more important terms: love, soul, ego, being in the now, spirituality - all of which he tries to get to the bottom, in a very philosophical, but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his criticism of society, his political commitment – and also how he not only shaped the music (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
The latter has also approached the ascetic monk Konstantin Wecker, who arises "by subtraction", as he says, "by leaving out all the unnecessary".
Between all the highly spiritual views, however, there are also short anecdotes to the earth: for example, about rackets in a GI’s frequented restaurant or an insane drive, where he frontally targeted a tree.
There, too, he is ruthlessly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me in the arm.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants to Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry auditions for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father and originated from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He attended "many" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, you just heard his voice: "Stop the crash.
Leave your sister alone.
Move! Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were grown up when I was a child - went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket bat.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Much of my life he was this serious guy in the corner reading the newspaper.
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at the time of his father, he did gain an insight into what life might have been like for him.
It's a little brighter now, but they're dark, smoked, deep squid labyrinths with flame hits and smoke and lots of soot.
My father used to just lay down in the tub and then one could slowly hear him start singing because he could wash the foundry off himself.
As I walked around there, I realized that he had done that for years to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him became greater.
Still, Henry grew up as a child without his parents’ love certificates.
My father never embraced me, he never said "I love you."
It was only when my mother went bad towards the end of her life that we began to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Could you stop with the "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
It is still friends with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
This contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, “You need to be radical.
So I went through this fitness thing and also had to do a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's exhausting.
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henry's career change may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut beard.
Since being praised by critics for his Othello, he has been accepted by the theatre.
It followed The Comedy of Errors, and then Fences by August Wilson.
This is a different experience from the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy working life.
He started at just 16 years old when he was working in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage as he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the mid-seventies. "I was the only black impersonator/comedian on television for quite a long time."
He learned in the profession.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, but also learn from 1975 to 1985 how to become an efficient joke-telling machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
As his manager owned the stage rights at the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people “painted black,” Henry performed his comedy there for over five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I kind of wish it had never happened, but I'm not sorry I did.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "year-long award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
By introducing characters that ridiculed and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked in the eighties on an alternative comedy circuit.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show went on show in 1984, and in the 1990s, he was known, among other things, as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
Advertising, documentaries, TV series, and film roles shaped his next decade, but after his 2008 BBC series LennyHenry.tv he thought, "What are you doing next, Len, because it all feels like you're just spending time or stepping a little on the spot."
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 titled What's So Great About ...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him in school and considered him mostly a middle-class domain, whites in tights and a cabbage head in front of it.
So I was very afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should try it.
Don't do it badly if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take a few of the words in your mouth, and then you’ll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry performed 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was thrilled.
I felt like I could do it.
It was almost as if someone had finally put me on my head.
"That's what it's about, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, do some research.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did.
And it was a success.
They seemed to be expecting a car accident, and that just didn’t happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of the errors.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical mistake and Henry instinctively felt he had to entertain the audience.
“A small voice told me, ‘You have to bridge now for 10 minutes while they repair the computer.’
Instead, the stage director announced that the idea continued as soon as the problem was solved.
I walked off the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for that.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, which strengthens the tendons.
It was also good, so it is like a great shield of the gods telling me "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a humiliating voice.
So I'll stay with it.
I really love that.
I love being in a rehearsal room.
Henry, however, still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is steeped in humorous outbursts, while always imitating people.
I have decided not to do a stand-up comedy because I find that this kind of instant gratification from a hall full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you always look for it, you drive it in front of a wall.
I sometimes perform live at Apollo when I feel like it, but overall I don’t give as much as I did before.
I ask him if he will ever do a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps shape a beginning, a middle part and the end of a journey - I don't think I ever want to give up.
Is this his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that’s great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block roads in Yemen's capital
In the conflict between Shiite Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Huthi have called for civil disobedience in the capital Sanaa.
Huthi supporters had occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, a spokesman for the Huthi party said "Ansar Allah".
Access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemeni media report a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper "Yemen Post", Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi had called for the measures on Sunday evening.
Huthi threatened, according to the paper, with a further escalation of the conflict if his demands were not met.
The Shiite Huthis are fighting for more independence from the Sunni-ruled Yemen and calling for the resignation of the government.
The people of the Huthi have been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Around 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the major access roads of Sanaa.
There are always bloody battles with the Yemeni army in the surrounding area.
Kenya registers civil servants to contain "ghost employees"
Kenya has begun to biometrically register all state officials in order to remove "spirit workers" from the government's payrolls.
Employees who did not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, was a government statement.
The government suspects that thousands of people still receive salary payments even after their departure from the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in public service during his inauguration in 2013.
In an audit earlier this year, it was found that at least $1 million ($700,000) per month was lost in payments for “mind workers” and other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid to accounts after a person dies or leaves the public service, reports Wanyama Chebusiri for the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at identification centres in the next two weeks to ensure that their data on biometric registrations is recorded, has been notified in a government message.
Anyone who did not do this without a credible apology would be removed from the payroll, the message continued.
"This approach will significantly contribute to the rationalization of public service by identifying the actual number of officials and also clearing the payroll at both levels of government - thus eliminating the 'spirit workers'," said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary at the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The scandal surrounding art consultant Helge Achenbach will be discussed in court for the first time on November 11.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, in a civil trial at the Düsseldorf Regional Court, are demanding 19.4 million euros in damages from Achenbach and two of his companies, which are in insolvency proceedings.
This was reported by a court clerk on Monday.
The complaint states that Achenbach cheated on the purchase of works of art and classic cars and that Berthold Albrecht charged higher than actually paid purchase prices.
As a result, the agreed commission was also higher.
Achenbach bought valuables for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
He spent 44 years in school, 23 of them as a school principal.
From this time Manfred Richter knows many confessed Petershauseners and Kollbachers from their time as pupils.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always carried by his striving to see people in the student.
The snowmobile is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his home country.
Richter was born in Trautenau/Nordbohemen in 1930, today Trutnov.
At the age of 14, he became interested in the teaching profession after four years of high school.
A year later, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their home.
After a few months in a camp, in 1946 it went to Bavaria - in the freight wagon.
This is how judges went to the Upper Franconian village of Senkendorf.
Teacher training took place in Bamberg.
For this, Manfred Richter had to walk six times a week ten kilometers to the nearest station, take the train to Bamberg, go to school there three kilometers across the city and return in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter got a sleeping opportunity in a red cross home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 students in a dormitory.
In 1951 he passed the first state examination and in 1954, after three years as a teacher, he passed the second state examination.
Since Oberfranken did not have a free teacher position for him, he applied for Oberbayern and came to the school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "Fr<0xC3><0xA4>ulein-Zimmer" was his first "service apartment" in the schoolhouse.
In 1958, he moved to a three-room service apartment in the newly built teacher's house next to the school.
This house bought Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school was dissolved in Kollbach in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach in the school association Petershausen-Kollbach and five in Petershausen.
From the 1968/69 school year, these were combined in Petershausen in today’s town hall.
When the school association Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in the village.
To avoid a setback in the now smaller school, the then rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and so the children and their teachers were able to acquire the current construction from September 1982, which was expanded in 1997 after Richter's retirement.
Manfred Richter praised the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who had a workshop built on municipal costs and during the 1997 expansion of cellars, although this was not eligible under the guidelines for school buildings.
"Bürgermeister Götz was very school-friendly," Judge recalled gratefully.
Throughout his career, Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government representative who responded to a lecture by a school council on law and justice: "You must never forget love." Manfred Richter put what he had heard there as a young teacher.
“You have to give the children two things: roots and wings,” says the 84-year-old.
And he had to learn, "It's not always possible." Whether he means only his students or just his own six children, it's not quite clear.
In any case, Judge's actions were sometimes unconventional.
When students beat themselves up, they did not receive any criminal work from him, nor were they allowed to sit down.
At the expense of the community, Richter had bought two pairs of boxing gloves and had the two counterparts compete against each other, even if there should be a violet.
For the sake of the school, as rector, judges maintained a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
This moved the non-partisan judge after his retirement to run for the municipal council at least as the last on the CSU list in 1996.
But Judge was selected in sixth place and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists stop in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten
If cyclists take a rest on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten, this is in itself nothing special.
On Friday alone, however, the number of resting participants was impressive: the 700 participants of the hr4 bike tour and the accompanying tross enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party in the open air in the Schottener Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "Radling and celebrating on newly discovered roads between Nidda and Kinzig" the participants had met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday and experienced a concert by Van Baker & Band there.
On Friday it became serious: The cyclists took the first stage, which took 60 kilometers via Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and on to Schotten.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had started his bicycle in Bad Vilbel, and the head of the private company Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
To refresh the body and mind, all kinds of good things had been prepared: the rural women from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 plates of apple, Swiss, Streusel and cheese cakes, which wonderfully encouraged the skilled cyclists.
"Such cakes can only bake country women," praised one participant from Aulendiebach, while ordering another piece.
Cold refreshments could be obtained at the beverage stand of the Gei<0xC3><0x9F>-Nidda Turnverein.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained visitors with well-known melodies from operettas and musicals and garnered enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park was relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He deserved it, after all, he has already re-fastened bicycle chains that have already sprung off".
Meanwhile, the mayor and the manager had to work: they were interviewed at the fountain in front of reporter Rainer Janke’s drinking house and took advantage of the opportunity to advertise on the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Tobias Hagen, PhD, who has been on the tour since the first hr4 tour in 2004, was only able to catch up briefly, but he had a lot to do with the technology on site.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated with his employees and the 15-person motorcycle staff of the Hessen police using three telephones and a radio, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants come from the Rhine-Main region," he said, "but also from Giessen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or Taunus, and even from numerous cities in Westphalia, cyclists have arrived.
The number of participants depends a bit on the available accommodation capacity.
In Category I, participants are accommodated in hotels, in Category II, in collective accommodations.
The bikers had a good impression of the resort when they broke up again after an hour and a half: "Good-bye!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved to say goodbye.
After arriving in Schotten, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening the cyclists were required in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Schottener Gesellschaft für Tourismus und Stadtmarketing (GTS), the park had received a beautiful festive atmosphere and of course had prepared treats, such as flame cakes with well-cooled spring whites.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Ho<0xC3><0x9F>feld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his role as board member of the ADAC Hessen-Thüringen welcomed the visitors.
The three were visibly pleased with the "many operations in Scots".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity to swing around in the open air was eagerly used despite the sporty activity on the bike.
Among the guests, there were more and more people who were affected by the good mood as well as the large crowd of cyclists.
On the second day, the stations Birstein, W<0xC3><0xA4>chtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the pedalos - were on the programme for the cyclists.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of cycling, the athletes met again in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey due to suspicion of "conspiracy against the government," local media agencies report.
Police did not comment immediately.
Among those arrested are 14 high-ranking police officers, reports Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government employees, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly setting up an organized criminal association and tapping phone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then prime minister) described her actions as part of the activities led by Islamist cleric Fethulla Güllen against him and other people in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful everywhere over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian people's front must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, head of school in Slavyansk, who visits Jazenjuk’s daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that there will finally be peace here again and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in their future lives.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with the children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
She meets with a proud reputation from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And she has her own front experience.
She began her career with Bain and Co., a global management consultancy, and then moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI, and Pearsons’ media world.
She served as Chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when Pearson’s parent company’s top post went to a younger male colleague.
Their severance was reportedly nearly <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
Their political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, when he sought more private-sector knowledge in Whitehall: she became a cabinet consultant.
Her husband is a former Tory Councilman.
Already in May I described the chairman's task with a poisoned chalice.
Not only does the BBC stand as a huge and complex unit at the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two directions: inward to the first guard of one’s own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outward as a voice of public concern and unrest when things go wrong.
This creates an almost unsustainable duopoly that demands complete comprehensive reform.
But what incoming chairman would risk stepping on everything and taking apart an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps killing himself.
It is a difficult task.
And as if that wasn’t enough, many are also interested in seeing the BBC shrinking – power, money and status overtaken.
As competition approaches and new technologies threaten old, comfortable security, the forthcoming negotiation of licensing fees for the BBC is associated with special dangers.
For the modest sum of <0xC2><0xA3>145.50 a year, the British public is buying into the world’s largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: it says it reaches 96 percent of all households and each of them costs only 40 pence per day.
And apparently the BBC is rising again on the popularity scale: 53 percent support them today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get news headlines on my phone these days and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and remarkable institution.
She needs a remarkable chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas Says Declining Tweet Was Not Authorized
A tweet from Texas Republican Governor Rick Perry's official user account on Sunday contained a derogatory comment about the Democratic District Attorney, who is at the center of a criminal charge against him for abuse of office.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another one of Perry's user accounts, which rebuffed the previous one.
Just sent a tweet from my account that was not authorized by me.
“I didn’t approve of the tweet and deleted it,” the letter said.
Perry's staff did not respond promptly to requests for comments.
Although the tweets went out of Perry's official user account, it wasn't clear who was actually serving the feed.
In the earlier tweet, an unfavourable picture was drawn of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunken driving in April 2013.
Perry vetoed a financial promotion of her office when she refused to resign, leading to an indictment against Perry — who might be a 2016 presidential candidate — before a grand jury this month in Austin.
The tweet's text reads, "I don't always drive drunk with the triple permissible alcohol level ... but when I do, I'll sue Governor Perry when he's talking about it."
I am the most drunk Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not in charge of investigating the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the indictment a political trick.
His high-class team of attorneys applied to the judge in charge of the case to dismiss the charge, arguing that the law with which the most senior governor is in the history of the state of Texas is unconstitutional is unconstitutional.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of state funds at the state’s Public Integrity Unit – which is based in Travis County and in cases of state corruption in Texas – when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto caused a public complaint on the part of a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry’s official user account is frequently updated – and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth at the Iowa Elections during his 2012 presidential candidacy, Perry went on to speculate that he would stop by posting a tweet of a photo of himself jogging near a lake, saying "South Carolina, we're coming!"
Berkeley declares housing market "normal" again
One of London’s most prominent builders pointed out that the housing market in south-east England was “returning” to normal levels.
Homes in the capital were highly coveted and subject to huge price increases, which prompted the Bank of England to set limits on mortgage loans in June due to the widespread fear of a credit bubble.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of high-class construction firm Berkeley, said on Monday: “Since the start of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the 2013 peak,” adding that this offered a “stable action environment.”
The real estate market in London was well positioned during the downturn, as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to information provided by the Disaster Office, prices in the urban area alone rose by 18.5 percent in the past year, far more than the average increase in England and Wales overall.
Average sales prices at Berkeley’s private, low-priced and student offerings rose by about one-fifth last year, reaching <0xC2><0xA3>423,000 at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound has made property ownership in London less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric for a possible "willow tax" before the general elections in May.
London real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report for April, which introduced tighter lending regulations, would also lead to lower market growth in both real estate sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday show a decline in mortgage approval in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling down.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, revised its forecast for the rise in real estate prices in London for 2015 down to 3 percent, based on an already weakening house price awareness.
The volume of transactions in the most expensive areas of London such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has fallen by a quarter year after year, according to the broker WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital for Berkeley is a blessing, as the due amount for futures sales amounts to more than <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion.
Mr Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result, future sales have also remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year to the end of April – almost a third more than the 2007 peak before the crisis.
Annual pre-tax earnings increased by 40 percent annually to <0xC2><0xA3>280 million, sales by 18 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.
In a statement on Monday before the company’s annual meeting, Mr Pidgley said that the revenues for Berkeley in the current year are expected to meet current market expectations.
Analysts estimate the annual pre-tax profit to be <0xC2><0xA3>450 million.
Berkeley shares were fixed at <0xC2><0xA3>23.96 in London trading in the afternoon.
Nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence published by hackers on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence performs at the 85th Academy Awards.
Nude photos of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a “master list” of images of another 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that Lawrence's photos were genuine and accused the hacker of "clattering violation of privacy".
The authorities have been notified and will track all those who continue to post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on the photo sharing page 4chan were allegedly obtained by a gap in Apple’s online storage system iCloud. The alleged “master list” of hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed reported.
It’s not certain how many of the images are real, although Winstead, star from “Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world” also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those of you who look at photos that my husband and I took years ago in the private environment of our house - I hope you're really happy with you," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious" disagrees, however, that the photos were about pictures of her and tweeted "These so-called nude pictures of me are FALL, folks.
Let’s start with the beginning. *Word game intended*.
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a spokesman for pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photos of her.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J".
They decomposed, so you could best describe it, they slowly dissolve like a cardboard box that you left standing in the rain.
Occasionally, a woman told him he was too serious, strenuous, intense, distant, and maybe a bit scratchy.
Then he shook his hand.
He knew Kratzbürstig.
He was stingy, like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this stupendousness was a straight-start affair that had been more promising for a relief of the lonely boredom of his life than usual, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a trembling delicate beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart from a village on the North Island that was even more remote and rougher than Port Reuben.
She had come to the south with an older accompaniment, which Kevern held for her aunt, and which had inherited a plot of land in a damp but paradisiacal valley with the apt name Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leaky, in the bathrooms were still spiders, naked snails had left their marks on all windows and believed that they were all part of it, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like huge cabbage heads.
It was like the house of a children's fairy tale, both threatening and enticing, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the longlist for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had happily sat with Ailinn holding hands on the broken deck chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon, both of which had been mentally absent in the service console, which provided the country with calming music and soothing news, when the sight of their crossed, brown-skinned father had reminded him of an old song of a long-forgotten black stash.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their own aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - nothing was so forbidden - simply not played.
It was successfully obsolescent, just as the word obsolescent.
The general taste was able to do what decrees and regulations would never have done, and how people in books choose the Vom-Tellerw<0xC3><0xA4>cher-Zum-Million<0xC3><0xA4>r-Memoires, cookbooks and romance novels, so they chose the ballads in music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began playing an imaginary piano and singing in a groovy-comic Serenade Ailinn's big feet.
Ailinn didn't understand that.
"This was a well-known song by a jazz pianist called Fats Waller," he explained to her and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done this to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was still small.
His father had played it with his own father, he had said.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it will cost you a penny.
It wasn’t a very fun game back then, and it wasn’t very fun now either.
He knew this was expected of him, that was all.
I had to explain what jazz was.
Alinn had never heard of any of them.
Jazz was not played, even if it was not directly forbidden.
The improvisation was no longer modern.
There was only room for a single “if” in life.
People wanted to be sure at the beginning of a melody where it would end.
And the mind as well.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
Jazz was a musically expressed mind.
Although he had turned 10 years old without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from his father’s half-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn’t have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably couldn’t remember a time when pop singers weren’t black.
Again, there were no laws or constraints.
A conforming society meant that every element of this society gratefully agreed to the principle of group talent - gratefully as those spared from fate.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sports by temperament and physique, so they sang and ran.
People originally from the Indian subcontinent were blessed with electronic talent, as if by nature, and were tasked with ensuring that no family remained without a functioning telephone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewerage; what was left of the Greeks smashed plates.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levante whose grandparents had not quickly left the country as WHAT WAS HAPPENED, WHEN IT WAS HAPPENED - for fear of being accused of fires, for fear even that the flames would consume them next - had been confounded by Labneh- and Shisha-Speifen-Restaurants, who had been intoxicated with fear.
Each according to their abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, it was difficult for Ailinn to understand how the insulting words Kevern had just uttered to her could ever be sounded.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really insulting," Kevern said.
Except maybe for people whose feet are too big.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the huge cabbage-like leaves.
Ailinn still did not understand.
Why would your father have loved something like that?
He wanted to say it was a jux, but hesitated to put two fingers on her lips again in her presence.
She thought he was something strange.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief and blocked Kevern's sight.
There was nothing else to see all over the world except her untamed raven-black hair.
There was nothing else he would have wanted to see.
"If you say so," they mean without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're prepping it for me.
She seemed honestly worried.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Your feet are not so straight.
Maybe your ankles, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
“Your big ankles are exactly the reason you like me,” he tried instead.
I'm a little perverse.
That didn't sound right.
It was supposed to be funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often got into trouble because, like his father, he did not have the soothing charm needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel too.
Maybe he wanted to be, Kevern.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons got red and got up from her deck chair, threw the console over and poured the wine they had drunk.
Holunderblütenwein, so drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In her excitement, she seemed to tremble, like palm branches in a storm.
"And your big head is exactly the reason I'm attracted to you," she said.
Except that I'm not at all.
She felt sorry for him, both for the unnecessary unkindness of his words and the fear that appeared in her eyes when she rebelled against him.
Did she think he would beat her?
She had not told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially the same as here.
The same huge and ice-cold ocean broke down here as there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more dizzying after what had happened to their ancestors as smugglers and beach robbers, moved from pub to pub, always ready to raise their hand against a woman who refused or ridiculed them.
Dickkopf?
They would have shown her a fat fist if she didn’t pay attention!
She was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the unspoken love ballads from the console - she first kissed and then beat.
In Kevern's view, this was an unnecessary refinement, since the crunching itself was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to go through her body.
He got up from the deck chair like an old man.
She also felt diapered, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
That was not the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
She watched him as he walked away from a room on the upper floor, as her companion watched him, a man complained by something he himself had conjured up.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, bent his back, ashamed, defeated, without a fighting spirit - why was this a sight she seemed to know well, if she could not remember a single time she had seen something like this before today?
When she was alone again, Ailin looked at Solomon’s feet.
Several years before the events just told, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for the public mood, worked on a short talk about continued violence at a low and medium level in precisely the parts of the country where the reduction in energy, if not abolition, was the most likely to be expected.
"A lot has already been done, and much more has yet to be done," she wrote, "to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people who have waged a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, where the sweet breath of human kindness has historically been rarely felt despite the high-profile church towers between the hedges.
But some properties turn out to be indestructible.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the lower the passion it continues to awaken.
The population weeps while listening to sentimental ballads, intoxicates itself with stories of overcome difficulties and claims to firmly believe in the virtues of marriage and family life, yet not only does the former rawness hold the rural communities as well as our urban fabric firmly in hand, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and derisory quarrel at home, in the workplace, on the streets.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," her mentor said when he read the whole report.
I suggest that you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask: are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," replied Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Once again, Esme relied on her right to privacy and denial of the statement.
Feminist?
Again silence.
“I don’t ask that,” Luther Rabinowitz finally said, “because I would be against atheism, lesbianism, or feminism.
This is a non-prejudiced workplace.
We serve a prejudice-free society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which in themselves are absolutely acceptable and praiseworthy, can occasionally distort results as you have presented them.
You yourself obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things, which you call "interactive" and "raw," could be interpreted by others as an expression of a natural force and vitality.
If you continue to ride around on what is happening when it is happening, as if it had happened yesterday, it means taking the land its essential life force.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED lettering in Flamingoosa repeated the advice that Ofnow had given to the country in the last quarter century or longer.
Smile at her neighbor, appreciate her partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use her phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written word, but nothing is better than love.
"I totally understand what you want out of it," replied Esme Nussbaum with a calm voice, as she was sure her superior had finished speaking, "and I say nothing more than that we are not yet as effectively healed as we imagine ourselves.
My concern is that, without warning, we may find ourselves repeating the mistakes that are at all only to what is happening when it is happening.
This time, however, it is not the others that we let go of our anger and distrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
In order to indicate an angelic patience.
“You go too far,” he said, “if you call actions “errors” that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
They also go too far if you talk about them omitting their “worship” and their “distrust” to “others.”
It should not actually be necessary to remind someone in your position that in understanding the past as in protecting the present, we are not talking about "us" and "others".
There was no "we" and there was no "other".
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
“Of whom, if we are honest with ourselves,” Esme dared to inject, “no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I'm not complaining to anyone.
Whether it was done badly or well, what has happened has happened.
That was then.
There is nothing more to be said about this - we agree.
And just as no fault has to be assigned, no guilt has to be repaid if such a repayment is appropriate and if there is a way to repay it.
But what does the past serve if we don’t learn from it?
The past serves to make us forget it.
If I can say anything about it -
Luther Rabinowitz collapsed his pyramid.
"I will consider her report," he said, and released her.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was driven over by a motorcyclist, who, as passersby described, had driven on foot in a sort of "brutal rage".
There are coincidences.
Lesotho Military Member Says No State Strike Is Planned; Prime Minister Remains in South Africa
Official military officials in Lesotho argued that they had planned a coup d’état to overthrow the government and said they were going against police officers accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and announced that the country's army had surrounded its official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The prime minister brought his family to neighbouring South Africa after reporting of assassination threats.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said there was no coup d'état de facto, but the military responded to the threat posed by "political fanatics" whose armament was imminent by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of Lesotho's defense forces were acting after receiving several intelligence reports that inside the police were acting some elements that actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were about to do devastating damage," he told Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action had made the impression of a overthrow.
"Even though no one has claimed to have torn the government by force itself, all reports agree that Lesotho's defense forces' activities so far show signs of a coup d'état," he said.
Lesotho military officials said on Sunday that the troops were retreating to their barracks and the situation in the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the leadership during Thabane’s absence.
Thabane said he believed he had become the target because of his attempt to combat corruption in the country.
There have been great tensions in Lesotho since June after Thabane suspended parliamentary meetings due to the clashes in his unitary government.
He said his actions would not have undermined the government, in spite of accusations that were otherwise eloquent.
Production in the Eurozone on a 13-month low
The increase in production in the eurozone slowed to the lowest point in the last 13 months in August, according to a closely observed study.
The final Markit Purchasing Manager Index of Manufacturing Industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, according to a level of 51.8 in July.
An indication above 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders declined and factories experienced break-ins at a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures will be received before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
Markets expect the bank to have a clear plan for dealing with a hesitant recovery in the eurozone and for the threat of deflation at an inflation rate of just 0.3%.
There is speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further information over the course of this week as to whether he is considering a quantitative relief for the eurozone, according to those made by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
“Although small growth is better than no growth at all, the slowing effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become more apparent to manufacturers,” said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the second largest economic nation of the block, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a child of concern, as well as the decline of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Evidence that growth incentives in the key industrial mechanism Germany, Spain and the Netherlands are no longer taking hold is also not reassuring,” Mr. Dobson said.
The decline in industry is likely to fuel the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economics expert at IHS Global Insight, said, “The best thing you can say for the August-based purchasing manager index of the manufacturing industry in the Eurozone is that after that, the sector continues to grow.”
He added: "Producers in the eurozone are currently obviously finding life quite difficult, as the current heightened geopolitical tensions - particularly with regard to Russia and Ukraine - are increasing uncertainties in the still difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly impacted the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and are likely to cause some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said it would be “always more likely” that the ECB would eventually have to initiate some type of QE, “although we suspect this will be limited.”
The Hell Decade of the Survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children involved in it still suffer today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death at the atrocities in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the horrific siege of the school of Beslan, in which 334 people died, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatic Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, it seemed like the worst of evil.
The tragedy united the West and the East in disgust, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death at the atrocities in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, even though the memory of this terrorist hell will haunt them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that is now haunting Ukraine - and in which children like them die - is now coming to an end.
The girl who was photographed trying to climb back into the school sports hall
She was photographed and famous by Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov when she only tried to climb back into the school sports hall after a mine exploded.
Completely confused, Aida looked for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were considered dead, but they survived.
“A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn’t,” Aida said.
My legs were flooded with blood.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier took her to safety.
After a series of surgeries, she thought she was completely healed, but said yesterday: “Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I'll have to go back to surgery.
Some garnet splinters are still in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist to help people how she was helped by doctors.
“This tragedy changed my life, but it didn’t break me down,” she says.
“That happened to me, and you can’t change that.
Once a year I always go to the sports hall to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little, and dreamed of going to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says the siege will always remain a part of it, even though the memory gets a little weaker every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in the UK and everywhere.
When I see the photo of me climbing back to school online, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster, and help prevent it from happening again.
The boy who flew through the ball-shaft, in the opinion that his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians go to school at age 7) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
As a seven-year-old, he said, "Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she was going to die.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearing that she might be dead, he fled and saw a crying infant on the way, grabbed it by the hand, and fled through a ball of hail.
His father Vladimir, who closed his son in his arms outside, said: "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In reality, Tamara had stumbled outside and suffered leg injuries in the hospital, assuming her son had died.
After her reunion, she said, "I cried for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and embraced me.
Damir was later flown to London (from the now disbanded News of the World newspaper) to receive the title of a Barnardo's Children's Champion from then-Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say it's going to get worse in my memory.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that’s not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I'm not thinking about myself.
I remember those kids I played with in the yard and they didn’t make it out there.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the sports hall.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially at the toy store, where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in an upstairs open car.
But now he is afraid of places like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune he and his friends suffered.
This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from the atrocities," Damir said, who worked last week as a volunteer in a monastery.
I want to help so much.
I want to go to the police one day and hope that they will take me to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and walk around, and this silence lasted for many months.
She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir.
The people in London were crying when I told our story.
I understood at that time how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and the opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London, and how Damir and I helped.
I remember how Damir wanted to eat Borschtsch and they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember playing with waiters in a restaurant, Damir shot her with his water gun, and they ran away and played with him.
And that was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British so willingly shared our pain and supported us.
She said, "I always think that this world has not improved in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war continues now, and every day people die, and I believe that many children were killed and still are killed.
They are just like our children.
I think that for many of the war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know how these people feel, the whole horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that is so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and calm boy, he is not at all aggressive or angry.
For example, he is not looking for revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the past atrocities.
I know he doesn’t like to remember it, but he has six close friends from class and they occasionally go to the sports hall and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember him sometimes lying on the sofa, turning his face away from us for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember throwing away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, bigger than me, handsome, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and got on my legs, I looked around, and saw hell around me, with body parts lying all around.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could not possibly have survived in this hell.
"I remember calling to him, 'Damir, run, run away,' but I was also so sure he hadn't heard me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And so life goes on for us, unlike many others.
Georgij Ilyin, 17 years old
The boy whose terrible image after the siege became the symbol of the abomination of Beslan
Trost: The Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the 2004 siege, on the right a picture of Georgij today
His blood-stained face was drawn by fear as he ran for his life while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of Beslan’s barbarism.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dropped him off for his first day of school before she rushed to take her older son Vladimir to university.
“I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there alone for three terrible days,” she recalls.
Not all alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgy managed to survive.
The closer that date approaches, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don’t think it’s been a long time, I mean it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days always follow me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgij wanted to go to school that day, and he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of crying Georgij in San Marino.
Georgij does not like to see the picture, and it is hidden in the bookshelf at home.
I understand this, but I also think that people all over the world feel our pain thanks to this picture.
Georgij says today: "It is important that such a thing can never happen again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People keep investigating such tragedies and never learn the truth.
And now they are investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused him?
This world is becoming something terrible.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because when you ask people, no one wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years is nothing to do with such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget it a little bit.
It attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was scared every day.
I was thinking of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That’s why I always go to the sports hall as September 1 approaches.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It’s hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I don’t feel like a victim, this story is now a part of my past.
I won't forget it, but I'm not sorry.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and attended a medical college in Vladikawkaz.
I will be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn’t allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen.
Georgij Fanijew, 20
The boy who survived even though he was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgij Fanijew was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was trapped in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb, which was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It is truly a miracle that he was not killed.
“We feel like it was yesterday,” says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as an intelligence officer, but could not do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me, it's nothing I've left behind.
I'm older now and people are saying that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say, that's not true.
"In 2006 I worked with psychologists and actually felt a little better after that, but I can't forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - the year after - was the first and only time I went back to the sports hall.
I lost consciousness.
I will never go back there again and please do not ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgij Fanijew today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is tremendous and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don’t like to think or talk about it and they never asked me about school.
I am physically well.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can walk well now.
But because of my health, I couldn’t study at the FSB’s Intelligence Academy in Saint Petersburg, as I wanted to.
I sent in my documents, including the medical ones, and they replied that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, "I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should know nothing about it, and of course they should not suffer.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He is in my soul, worse when the anniversary comes closer.
I will go to the celebrations to remember.
I know Georgy won't go.
It has to be even more intense for him because he was there and I wasn’t.
I was waiting for him at home and couldn’t help.
I am so grateful to God that he has been returned to me, and here in Beslan all are drawn from it.
It stays in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It’s hard to accept that if something so unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't participate because of his knee.
He has been operated on several times, he can run, but he can’t do any sport.
I would say that he has overcome the horror by 50%, but you can never completely overcome and forget that.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege and that only exacerbates my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were expensive to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could give me, but my heart cries out for the dead.
I know of families where new children were born, but also of widows who have never married again.
It’s hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don’t want to.
I will never forget how my heart leaped in me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is very close to our country now and I can hardly believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can we fight now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that in Ukraine many children have already been killed and many more are being killed.
If only we could seize and expel all these rebels - as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The baby that was carried in safety so grippingly by a special deployment command
Rescued: Aljona Tskajewa is brought to safety (left) by a Russian Special Operations Command.
It is now ten (right) and does not remember the atrocities at all.
The world held its breath in 2004 when the baby Aljona was carried into the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let them go, but held back in their cruelty their 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar in the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous carnage.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried and has a little girl with his new wife Swetlana, whom he named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, now ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl, neighbors say.
“They are now a big happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children,” says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.
Man accused of overtaking girl on pedestrian crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man is on trial for driving over a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Steward is accused of driving a girl on the transition in Pittenween in East Neuk.
The indictment states that Mr. Steward controlled his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, contests the accusation before the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC initiated the trial for January.
4 Tips for Better Underwater Photos and Videos
If you would like to take photos or videos underwater, there is a selection of devices.
The most affordable option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are available for about $300.
I took these photos at a family party with multiple cameras, all available at a price of under $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other compartments are tightly closed.
Also set your camera to the photos or videos you want to record.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and recording modes that optimize the exposure time for the dark underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to what depth your equipment is functioning.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Look in our purchasing guide and reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Take multiple shots - because many won't work.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD that allows you to compose images, action cams usually do not.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see this underwater, and the right image setting is a matter of luck.
So make a lot of recordings.
If your camera has a series mode that makes a series of shots with slightly modified exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light gets dramatically worse, the further you move away from the surface.
If possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in a pool, lake or sea.
This also allows you to bring more color into your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also good advice on land, but it is all the more important underwater because of the poor lighting conditions.
It’s especially important if you’re working with an action cam: these devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means you need to get closer to your objects when they’re supposed to fill the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort whose character changes things, even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS.
As an anaesthesiologist, he devoted his career to saving the sick both the agony of the disease and the agony of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, was an MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that diagnoses and diseases are important to doctors, while the patients are mostly concerned with something completely different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
“I didn’t feel it,” he wrote in May of this year.
I had trouble picking up.
As he struggled with flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he was making impatient accusations against his wife Juliet.
"I'd rather do everything right now than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt quite unusual and worried for no reason.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to perform an X-ray examination of his chest.
Only two weeks ago he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray examination was available.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the breast skin, i.e. the skin that covers the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers have lung cancer, not all lung cancer sufferers have been smokers before.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber building material, which was once considered a "miracle" but has now been recognized as fatal.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be easily ignored.
Asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the industry voluntarily committed to stop using it.
Even where it was still used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric – plumbers, construction workers, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazardous material from another time, it hardly seems to be worrying today.
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is experiencing the climax of a mesolthelioma epidemic today.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease than from road accidents.
Annual figures of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in the UK
The reason we are now experiencing the deadly effects, although asbestos has been illegal for years (1999 all asbestos types have been banned), is that a mesothelioma only develops after decades.
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to former workers in the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is often still, present in the homes we live in, the offices we work in, the schools we learn in, and the shops we shop in.
And therefore, mesothelioma knows no class barriers, financial limits, professions or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not a shelter.
Parliament buildings are asbestos-infested.
Even in hospitals where we are supposed to be healthy, this deadly carcinogen has already been identified as the starting point.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was also not a plumber.
In fact, it was hard for him to imagine where he might have come in contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I was training for six years," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and gatekeepers - use the tunnels.
One wonders how many of my peers will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he could at least partially answer this question.
"Of the four doctors trained at Guy's Hospital and who have been suffering from mesothelioma for the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last one who still lives."
How many of us will still be sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48.
When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55.
This was an unusually long survival period.
Fifty percent of all mesothelioma patients die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends fatally.
So we can only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us will still get sick?”
Britain’s leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, estimates that between 1870 and 2050, if the asbestos epidemic in the UK is expected to end, a total of 90,000 of the disease will have been killed.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die like this.

A brief look at the files of the courts, to which the affected often turn because of claims for damages, shows how far the scourge of mesothelioma is already widespread.
In June of this year, Marks & Spencer admitted, for example, that Janice Allen had been negligently exposed to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations – one of them the flagship store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 when she started her M&S career.
Now she has two children in her twenties.
"Before this," she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought that would affect me.
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos does not refer to a substance, but to a group of six minerals.
The name derives from the word "asbestiform", a description of the fiber structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings today.
It has been used for roof panels, floor panels, pipe insulations, boiler insulations, even for brake pads in cars.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but is nevertheless considered by the EU and WHO as a "great health risk" with possible death consequences.
However, brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crocydolite) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "there is clear but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high mesothelioma rates."
An employee of Marks & Spencer was exposed to asbestos at the flagship store in Oxford Street, London.
Janice Allen may not have seen herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Peto’s work suggests that her story is by no means unusual.
He presented a study of those affected, showing that "a substantial proportion of mesothelioma was probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment without known exposure by work or at home."
Most of these contacts are based on the “normal use and aging” of our buildings.
It looks like no one can assume to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people might have been unknowingly exposed to the substance even in the heart of the government.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipelines behind Parliament's committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be stirred up by something as harmless as "strong air movements".
Members of parliament are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it looks like the opposite.
While the Executive Board of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace received a "clean health certificate", it is now undisputed that <0xC2><0xA3>1 billion of work must be spent over several years to renovate Parliament, modernize electrical installations and remove asbestos, and that after the 2015 general elections, MPs will probably meet in the nearby Q-conference.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the respective provisions."
No one knows if this mismanagement will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
A person who has never been able to accurately determine contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott suspects he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints were decided positively,” he says, “but I can’t prove it in my case.
It’s so hard to remember all the places you’ve worked and the data.
What he still remembers is the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he got such a kind of fever.
He was 45, and had surgery just late in the evening.
Suddenly I had chills.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I didn’t think I could make the trip home anymore.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain came from the breast skin, the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He didn’t go to work for a month.
Surprised doctors took X-rays of his chest and used pleuratheths to remove fluid from the lungs and test it in the lab.
However, his complaints remained undiagnosed.
His health improved slowly, and he returned to his workplace.
However, from time to time the symptoms returned, often after exercise and heavy breathing.
In 2011, a patient named Abbotts came into his practice with similar symptoms and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now Abbott did not associate this with his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in that case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again and his family doctor brought his CT scans and X-rays to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt ill for the first time, a probe equipped with a camera was introduced into the cave between the rib and the breast skin.
I am an optimist.
I usually just keep going,” he says.
Honestly, I didn’t worry so much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year: "It was told to me that it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis of Mesothelioma
Suddenly Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom advised him to take a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often insulated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now sick.
And so Mesothelioma now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who switched from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did), were most likely in contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that over several decades after the war, hospitals for patients may have been life-saving, but life-threatening for treating doctors.
It is still being removed today.
Students put their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
And it’s not just about hospitals.
Because of its fabulous insulating and flame-retardant properties, asbestos has been widely used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls.
Schools as well.
In fact, many people have probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Across the country, in thousands of chemistry hours, students have turned their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
On websites, the topic of asbestos in schools is now often addressed.
And meanwhile, such innocent items in our homes as floorboards or shed roofs have by default contained asbestos.
“It’s an industrial poison that’s contained in large parts of our properties,” notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy’s Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that occurred to an affected woman was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful how you tear off your garden sheds.
The effects of diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, are immense.
“It takes a while to process that,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to move on, but I realized I couldn’t focus on what I was doing.
I spent two weeks in practice.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to see another Christmas.
With the greatest difficulty was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was with all the information he had to deal with.
“It was very hard to take all of this in,” he says.
“I asked my doctor, ‘How long do I have?’
I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to see another Christmas.
That's it then."
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life-sustaining mechanism – the breathing itself – that causes deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of the smallest fibers.
When the asbestos is swirled up and the fibers are inhaled, they can settle in the breast skin, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the breast skin and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem arises with inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers," said Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax doctor who moved to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
Just the hospital that Andrew Lawson suspects has exposed him to asbestos is now ironically a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training at the hospital.
Once the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, “they are pushed from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
By nature, it has been invasive from the beginning.
The usual options for other cancers do not work so well with mesothelioma.
For example, the effectiveness of an operation is hotly contested.
Some say it is worth a try.
Treasure denies this.
"You can't cut out the breast skin," he says.
They don't come around with the knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer "does not respond very well to chemotherapy," which "shows effect," but does not heal.
“Sometimes there are long-term survivors,” Treasure says.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After contacting Mesothelioma, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and counseling office for those affected four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, Cancer Center," he cheerfully introduced himself to calls.
"He was very positive," Abbott says.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles lasting four months, and his life was expected to extend by only one month.
“I was desperate,” he says.
I wanted to give up.
However, Lawson managed to "make things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, heart-thorax specialist at Guy's.
“We had an advantage because I didn’t have to be referred, I just called and got an appointment,” Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to receive a referral and wait for the approval of the treatment.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma sufferers to be able to experience the best available therapies.
But when these treatments inevitably fail, many sufferers are faced with another financial concern – about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health," Morgan says.
But what changed in the 1960s is that it was recognized that even a very low burden posed a health risk.
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually filed their case, but it wasn't what Morgan calls a "full compensation," as Lawson couldn't prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact at Guy's.
However, after investigating his death, a Guy's spokesman confirmed that "the asbestos fibers in the affected basement area were removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
In fact, for mesothelioma sufferers who seek compensation, it is a huge problem to associate the deadly asbestos contact of a company or a workplace – usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those who resist claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response to this, there have been clear new legislations this year that make it easier for mesothelioma sufferers to file compensation, even if their former employers are no longer available.
The law has established a <0xC2><0xA3>350 million fund funded by the insurance industry for anyone diagnosed after July 2012 to be able to prove contact, but no one can sue.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80 percent of what a court could have promised them in a normal compensation process – about <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
Approximately 300 successful applications for the programme are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan, like so many mesothelioma sufferers, thinks that <0xC2><0xA3>350 million was a “very good job” in the insurance industry.
“This is a deal by insurers for insurers,” he says, suggesting that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if time had not passed and mesothelioma sufferers could find the companies and sue them normally.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pensions, also admitted that the law was “not perfect.”
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that in the face of seven deaths, quick action is needed every day.
"People are suffering so much and need help today," Penning said during the second hearing of the Mesothelioma Act in December of last year.
Graham Abbott has been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their first consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation, which, unlike Tom Treasure, he expects a positive effect.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy – a triple therapy that allows Lang-Lazdunski to present a five-year survival rate of up to 40 percent.
Abbott felt strengthened.
“Of course, that’s the most important thing,” Abbott says.
This is always seen in patients.
There's something that keeps you going.
When you give up, you get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
Aftercare scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just turned 50.
This is not life-threatening.
This is life-ending.
Again, Abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
Now no trace of the tumors is visible anymore.
But the process is physically and mentally very strenuous.
You have to think about practical things – about the money when I’m no longer, for example, or show my wife how the boiler time setting works.
If you get bad news, you will be negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
“It’s hard for parents,” he says.
It’s hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I had a disease that I wouldn’t grow old with.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and rude.
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for mesothelioma sufferers, such conversations are not pervaded by hope, not by a trace of hope for survival.
The disease brings (as well as ultimately for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim security.
As Andrew Morgan says, “Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.

China denies Hong Kong right to government election, protesters swear retaliation
On Sunday, despite the increased calls for democratic reforms, the Chinese parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong electorate.
This approach is likely to fuel the long-proclaimed protests in Hong Kong’s business district, while activists set the stage for planning and mobilization within a few hours of the announcement.
The Chinese People's Congress' decision allows Communist leaders to reject all non-peking candidates.
“This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry,” said legal expert Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing had promised.
The people of Hong Kong have been lied to.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, vice general secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the admission of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong government would be too "chaotic".
Since 1997, when Britain returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to let its residents elect the presidency of the government from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision of Sunday as a democratic breakthrough because there is a direct right to vote for Hong Kong citizens, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership keeps the course firmly in hand by a closely controlled Beijing nomination committee.
According to a new clause, only candidates "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong" are to be admitted.
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most public protests in Hong Kong have taken place for several years.
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers threatened to shut down the financial district if Beijing does not allow a real universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of Hong Kong’s government headquarters within hours of the announcement.
At the demonstration, the organizers said their movement has reached a new stage of civil disobedience and they are planning protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any details, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online announcement, the organizers announced that the movement "considered the occupation of the Central District only as a last resort, an action that should only take place when all the dialogue opportunities are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to say that today all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing’s announcement for days, and security measures were tightened in front of the government building on Sunday, including police forces and barricades.
The unrest is exacerbated by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The influx of people from the mainland strengthens the competition for products and services.
Moreover, the fear is growing that Hong Kong’s values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticized the Occupy Central Movement’s demonstrations as they jeopardized Hong Kong’s business operations – the lifeblood of Hong Kong.
"The protests they're talking about could cause major economic damage depending on how many people are involved in it and how long they last," said legal expert Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We don’t want to raise fears that Hong Kong will be out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China’s state-controlled media also recently reported on the democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organised an unofficial referendum on the electoral rights in which 780,000 people participated – more than a fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the region’s history.
The tradition of school graduation balls in the United States is now being transferred to universities, where freshmen performances are offered by private aircraft.
We look forward to responding to this demand and offering the UK’s first luxury travel service for students of today.
In order to make a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transportation options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service has a security division.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to cut their belongings in a dangerously overloaded car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury this year.
A company spokesperson said that no new bookings have been made since the service had just been introduced, but added that “students would book the service in the next few weeks.”
The company also announced that, despite the tuition fees of <0xC2><0xA3>9,000 per year, it expects a market for this offer.
Students today are very different in their expectations and demands from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago – it’s more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do just that.
However, the National Student Union criticized the service as being lifted.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the NUS for Higher Education said: “This offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students who start their studies this month face a crisis of living costs, as the available grants in the form of loans and scholarships do not keep pace with the rising bills for the simplest livelihoods before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds for something as simple as arriving in the student home.
Feminists Criticize Racial Question and Police Behavior According to Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants raised their hands in the air and sang, "Hands up, don't shoot," while waiting for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, due to the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
In their experience, white feminist commentators put the gender before the race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequalities.
However, while tensions in the Middle West increased and received attention throughout the country, Perez saw that white women’s responses revolved 100% around the race.
Compared to the responses of black women shortly after the August 9 shootings, the personal essays with titles such as "Thoughts to Ferguson by a White Woman" and "Feminism is not just about the oppression of women" came relatively late.
But for Perez, that was an important change.
“I don’t think there are many people in feminism who are talking about whites and privileges in such a high-class way,” she said.
People felt pressured to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnicized that they have to express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light problems that black Americans face every day, but are not considered “women’s topics” in the cultural space.
“I can post something funny on Facebook about myself and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere,” Mitchell said.
When I post something about how colored people in their own country are under siege, silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to speak publicly about a relationship, but not about public safety?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender, and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of separating the issues cleanly; they live in the combined reality every day.
While white women now connect the issues of race and gender in the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that her predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the rationale was almost always the rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
White women had to be involved in the story to justify the lynching murder.
For Hattery, the split between white and black women came to the point where white women campaigning for women’s suffrage, such as Susan B. Anthony, analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the fight for suffrage could only be successful for one group: women or blacks.
"They made the decision to advocate for women's suffrage, and the right to vote for blacks should come later," Hattery said.
When one remembers such things, one becomes aware with power why colored women do not trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took another decade for white women to organize against the lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, Mitchell says.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist responses to Ferguson’s questions—police behavior, racial discrimination—is a mirror of the time when white feminists played “catches” with the problems black women have been dealing with for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms take the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to control conception?" asked Mitchell.
Second-generation feminists who build their careers on the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now trying to understand what that means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after Michael Brown was shot and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, columnist of the Guardian, calling for more protests by white Americans on the subject of racism.
“I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason for understanding a danger inherent to the body — and opinions about the race that are distinctly different in public polls — will lead the change,” Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for a rather intersectional feminism, in which racial as well as gender issues are addressed, some of her comments on the racial issue in America are baffled.
Christina Sommers, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks to Ferguson stand in contrast to their previous criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently imposed a small program, My Brother’s Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were annoying reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that comes to the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. Border Police picked up nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the country’s southwest border this year, the issue of immigration reform is also coming back to the surface – this time as a women’s issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a re-consideration of the topic as an essential women’s theme, they only need to publish the stories of immigrant women.
“They speak for themselves,” Mercado said.
When the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women accompanying them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
“These stories find an afterthought in women’s organizations,” she said.
"Schweine-Haus" in Ipswich is for sale
The image of a house for sale was removed by real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a large pig that had made it comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has a bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
The details included a picture of the living room of the house - one of which was also a pig that had his head laid on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said the pig in the photo was the owner’s pet.
"However, the photo was mistakenly released and has since been removed," a company spokeswoman said.
In the House Exposé, Connells described the former assembly house as a "unique single-family house with a bedroom."
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on promotional material.
Home sales were of interest on social media when some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW city of Harvey is home to a new millionaire after winning the lottery
A lotto player from Harvey is up this month
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth continues, with a lucky winner receiving nearly $1.1 million from the lottery draw on Saturday.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey pulled the jackpot for the second time in five years in the draw of the first division, after $1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner still has to report.
Steve Forward, the store owner, said the profit was due to conversational material in the small town in southwestern Perth.
The city is not talking about anything else, and everyone is pretty excited.
We thought that such a gain could occur.
Eight WA winners have celebrated wins in the first division last month, a due conclusion for a few happy weeks for players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August, after a couple from Belmont just a few weeks earlier had achieved the $7.5 million mega win.
The winning couple had been playing for twenty years and said the win allowed them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
The Harvey millionaire is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of nearly $85 million.
Leonidas asked in the Gladiator Arena
Not only the gladiators were in the mud at the first Rheinbacher Römertag in the amusement park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract well over 1,000 visitors yesterday, who defied the rain showers and autumnal cold and let themselves be completely enthralled by the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful array of depictions, performances, games, exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their significance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial fighting force of the gladiatorial school "Amor Mortis", which used every rain break to demonstrate its robust martial art in the soft sand-prepared arena.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and knowledgeable presenter and successively sent his men into the ring for heroic combat in various gladiator genres.
First, the "provocators" were on the row with rectangle shield and short sword as well as the leg rail on the left leg and the arm rail on the right arm.
This was followed by the "Essedarii" with a chest shield, a short sword and a bulge, as well as an iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
Particularly impressive was the appearance of the "Retiarius", who started against the "Secutor" with throwing net, trident and dagger, and after a short fight pushed the boy to the ground.
Then the swords metallically joined each other, the shields created, and the vortexes flew surging through the arena, that a fear and fear could become for the health of the gladiators.
But the imposing Summa Rudis, the muscular referee, had an ever-attentive eye on them.
"We wanted to revive Roman everyday life and make the culture of the Roman period experienceable," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer "The Friends Circle of the Roman Canal", the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, an "Oppidum Romanum", a Roman city, as Deputy Mayor Claus Wehage noted in his greeting, became an "Oppidum Romanum" for one day.
After all, the Romans have not only brought war and conquest to our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous structures that we still admire today.
Remains of these were also to be admired during Roman Day, such as "Aqueduct marble" from the eleven-meter-high and 1400-meter-long Roman Canal Bridge, which was once located at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus Society once faced the water and energy supply and now, and Managing Director Petra Fricke knew: "We are still benefiting from the knowledge of then".
This is also confirmed by diploma surveying engineer Ralph Heiliger of the "IngenieurteamZwei" from Rheinbach, who presented surveying instruments of the Romans such as chorobat, groma or dioptra.
The Römervilla in Blankenheim presented sketches and models from the excavations in 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocauste, the warm air heating that once heated the Römervilla.
Impressive also the footprints left by Wolf and Fuchs two millennia ago in the footsteps of clay before they were burned.
In 2011, the Office for Soil Conservation at the Landesverband Rheinland had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the North Commercial Park in Rheinbach.
Covering walls of an economic building with a deer for drying grain and for milling have been found.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural estate, explained archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of finds from these excavations presented her in a glass display, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels, and parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century AD, until the invasion of the Germans in the then Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser suspects.
The children also dealt with the Roman windmill game, similar to today’s mill game, or they wrote their names with metal handles on wax boards like the Roman students.
At the stand of the Römerthermen Zülpich, the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, make glass mosaics at the stand of the glass museum Rheinbach and use a heavy wheat mill made of stone at the stand of the natural center Eifel Nettersheim to grind the flour for a flatbread or a cereal.
With the original, faithfully recreated Roman travel car drawn by two cold-blooded men, the visitors drove through the amusement park and also passed the impressive state of the Municipal Gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Roman project weeks".
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also contribute to the Roman year 2014, which is to commemorate the death of Emperor Augustus 2,000 years ago.
Together with the home and history clubs as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verein, the Partnership Association and the Oberbachem play club, thematic hikes, a lecture, cooking evenings as well as guided tours for school classes are offered and are reminiscent of the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legionary will tell of his work on the trainy Wachtberg, will present plants as living monuments from the Roman era and will offer a fun lesson in international understanding between a group of Wachtberger "Germans" and drawn Romans.
The Adendorf Primary School devotes itself to the theme of the Romans as part of a project week.
With the Roman Week, the numerous, often but no longer visible traces of the Romans in Wachtberg are to be made experiential again.
In the Wachtberger Town Hall, a small presentation will remind you of the discovery of the Berkum Matron Shrine in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic is straining West Africa's economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are lost – and international companies are at a distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is a serious blow to West Africa’s economy.
The harvest rots in the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are wiped out - the virus has difficult added to the region.
Some international companies are already at a distance.
“The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one,” African Development Bank chief Donald Kaberuka said in a statement.
Liberia is the hardest hit.
“It’s a total disaster, we’re losing a lot of money,” says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells Monrovia clothing on the second largest market in Liberia’s capital.
The only thing on the market is who wants to buy food or something to disinfect against Ebola.
Liberia has been hit hardest by the virus, and more than 600 people have been killed by the virus alone.
Recently, the health authorities declared that the disease had penetrated every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1,500 people have already died, and thousands more have died.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
Everywhere in the resource-rich countries, companies are suspending their operations.
Foreign companies such as the steel group Arcelor Mittal are withdrawing their employees, several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions.
Local traders and farmers also react: Only a few merchants still leave their home towns to buy supplies.
In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, among other things, the cocoa and coffee beans that are important for export rot in the fields.
The farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Food is getting scarce
“People will travel less and less,” says Phillipe De Vreyer, a Parisian expert on the economy of West Africa.
For example, the man who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables prefers to stay at home.
The population therefore gets to feel the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food is getting scarce.
In the markets, the supply of staple foods such as rice is declining.
At the same time, the region, which is heavily dependent on international companies, is threatened with image damage - with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies are basically avoiding the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French think tank Iris.
It is crucial how far and how long the virus will continue to spread.
Investors may feel “that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus to invest,” warns Hugon.
The disease also affects the strained state budgets of states
The disease also affects the already strained state budgets of the affected states.
The rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets will be heavily strained by the high spending on the health care system and, in addition, by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank already promised to help the health systems of the affected countries with $60 million (€45 million).
The effects are also felt in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed so far.
The oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta has not yet been affected.
But elsewhere, many people are already staying at home for fear of infection.
Reservations in hotels are also significantly reduced.
Sagittarius celebrate their 50th anniversary
The Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September.
The Schützenverein Tannenwald is preparing for the 50th anniversary of its founding from 12 to 14 September.
It is planned on Friday, September 12th, a big entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker".
Saturday is the big Böller shooting at 6 p.m.
Then in the big party tent is the evening of the mood with the "Stoapf<0xC3><0xA4>lzer Spitzbuam".
Blaskapelle takes care of the music
Highlights on Sunday are the Feast service and 9.30 a.m. in the parish church and the large fortification at 2 p.m.
In the afternoon there is also the price distribution of the Federal and Gaussian shooting.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 ladies with their dirndls.
Festkapelle is the Blaskapelle Berngau.
The patronage was taken over by Mayor Wolfgang Wild and Secretary of State Albert Füracker.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when the association for "social entertainment by means of exercise in room-studded and small-caliber shooting" was founded on 21 March.
The Nazi regime had caused the dissolution of the association in 1937.
It was not until 1964 that 19 young men found themselves again, who on April 30 at the inn Lukas raised the "new" Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau from baptism.
Karl M<0xC3><0xA4>rz and Adolf Ried led the club as patrons through a difficult start time, in which it was mainly about finding a club venue and installing the shooting operation.
In the autumn of 1965 the Schützenverein started in the inn "Leininger" with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sports shooters, now organized in seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga.
The club's records were broken every year and the magic limit of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
Just as the performance of active shooters has increased, the number of members has also developed positively.
After the club room "Leininger" no longer meets the requirements of a modern Schützenverein, the then board of directors, led by Johann Rinn, decided to create a future domicile in the basements of the new "Landgasthof H<0xC3><0xA4>rteis".
After a work of 2700 hours, on May 8, 1988, Pastor Strasser granted the ecclesiastical blessing for the new shelters.
One of the great highlights in the history of the club was certainly the 44th speed skating, combined with the solemn consecration of the new rifle flag in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary.
In 1995, a Böller Group was established.
Josef Schmalzl became Böllerreferent.
A major challenge for the "Böllerer" and for the association as a whole was the orientation of the Bavarian Böller Meeting 2005.
In many hours of volunteer work, the members of the association last year modernized the rooms and the shooting facility in the Berngauer Hof and thus updated the state of the art.
Eleven teams in round competitions
You can also see the sporting achievements of the Schützenverein.
A total of eleven teams are currently participating in the round competitions: six air rifle teams, one air pistol team, one sports pistol KK1, one youth and two AH teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann rose from the Gauoberliga (highest league in the Schützengau ANB) to the district league 1 in the 2013/14 round.
The second team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has risen from the Gauliga Nord to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to shooting, events such as Bockstechen, Faschings- und Königsball, club excursion and Christmas party have a tradition.
The patrons are also present at the festivals in parish and community.
Tony Stewart suffered an accident when he returned to the racetrack
Tony Stewart's return to the racetrack ended about halfway through his race at the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart drove against the wall for the second time after his right front tire burst into lap 172 and ended his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team chief Chad Johnston said his 14-member team was disappointed, but is now focusing on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
“I wish we had a better bet and a better result for him,” Johnston said.
We go to Richmond and hope we can do better there.
Stewart drove into a wall earlier in the race on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to have the right side of his car repaired.
"I went in today with quite good hopes for a good result," said Johnston, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the tractor and the team had packed and was ready to depart.
Stewart dropped out of three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver at an ashtray race in northern New York State.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the chase.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had stepped onto the road during a race to confront Stewart.
The authorities announced on Friday that the investigation into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been made as to whether Stewart should expect an indictment.
The three-time champion was received with great applause when he was presented before the race.
After a start at 12th position, Stewart had advanced to the first 10 shortly after and was temporarily in fourth place.
After a restart in round 122, Buschs
Car with No. 18 out of control after exiting curve 2 and collided with Stewart, both of which drove against the wall.
Stewart continued, but fell back to 21st place.
Dance-happy young people wanted
Just try: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and director Lisa Neitzel (from left) look forward to fellow contenders.
Like many other clubs, the jazz groups in TV Jahn also create full-day lessons at the secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have strongly decimated themselves.
Now, more and more young people are looking for a sport that is healthy and fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, a former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits", there are only nine children.
"Three in the group of eight- to twelve-year-olds, six in the group of twelve- to 15-year-olds," the 20-year-old says.
With more actives, the whole thing would be much more fun, "you could dance completely different choreographies," she says.
If you want to dance, on Thursdays between 5 pm and 6 pm or on Fridays between 5 pm and 6.30 pm, you can sneak into the training session at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistra<0xC3><0x9F>e 9, without obligation.
“Training regularly starts with a warm-up program,” the coach says.
After that, various choreographies are practiced.
JazzDance has the characteristic that there is no fixed form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore to classical music to sports and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, the conviviality is not too short either.
"We're going to eat, watch dance movies, and we've stayed in the dance room," says Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can make friendships, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development.
For those who don’t like jazz dancing, they can also get into one of the other TV Jahn offers.
On Wednesdays, children and young people can sneak into the lessons in the areas of children’s dance/jazz dance, bambini ballet, video clip dancing and hip-hop.
The dance coach is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to dance on Mondays and Wednesdays.
If you fancy discofox, slow waltzes, Viennese waltzes, rumba, cha-cha-cha and tango, you can stop by and join us.
Bulgarian prison guards protest nationwide
Hundreds of prison staff from all over Bulgaria have organized a nationwide protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which were recently changed.
Higher salaries are also on a demand list to be discussed with Interim Minister of Justice Hristo Ivanov.
Officials have been protesting symbolically against the new working hours for a month and are calling for a return to the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite the meetings between the union of prison staff and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the National Bulgarian Ratio (BNR) reported.
The negotiations are ongoing, said the Director-General for the implementation of punitive measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov to the BNR.
The protest of the prison staff is expected to be supported by members of the Union Union of Staff of the Ministry of the Interior.
Ukrainian army has abandoned Luhansk airport
In eastern Ukraine, the pro-Russian fighters are still on the rise.
After heavy fighting, which allegedly involved Russian tank battalions, the Ukrainian army today, Monday, abandoned Luhansk rebel stronghold airport.
At the same time, the army said that seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn personal consequences from the heavy defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top army leadership without mentioning details.
Pro-Russian separatists shot down plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government forces, pro-Russian separatists have, according to their own account, shot down another fighter aircraft and two military helicopters.
In addition, around 100 soldiers were injured or killed in fighting in the Donetsk region, according to the insurgents on Monday, Russian agencies said.
Coast Guard ships sunk
The insurgents also claimed to have sunk two boats of the Ukrainian Coast Guard for the first time in the Azov Sea.
The Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of his ships were under attack near the port city of Mariupol on Sunday.
Seven border guards were injured, a spokesman in Kiev told the station 112.ua.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media blamed Russia for the incident.
The separatists also reported having brought several villages in the Donetsk area under their control.
Diplomatic offensive in Minsk
Today, the Ukraine Contact Group meets in the Belarusian capital of Minsk.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, an envoy of the separatists from eastern Ukraine should also participate.
In advance, all actors used their performances to publicly announce their claim.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia due to the planned deployments in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO adheres to the founding agreement of the NATO-Russia Council of 1997.
The NATO chief, however, accused Russia of "a severe breach" of the agreement.
“Today, we have to face reality that Russia does not regard NATO as a partner,” Rasmussen said.
From documents and statements of the Russian side, it is stated that "they regard us as opponents".
Stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced that it intends to strengthen NATO’s presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Readiness Action Plan" to be decided at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as this is necessary," Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have officially agreed on new talks to settle their gas dispute.
The negotiations are scheduled for next Saturday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak said on Monday.
A decision by the European Union is still waiting for it to send a representative to the talks.
Because of the dispute over the price of gas, Ukraine has not received any fuel from Russia for weeks.
Recently, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger had communicated between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also disrupt gas supply for Europe.
Europe receives about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, a large part of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel Says Power Word: Toll Will Come "Clearly"
Now the chancellor clearly acknowledges this.
However, it is not a cover letter for all the complicated details.
Persevering concerns from the CDU against the car toll have increasingly outraged the CSU.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken a powerful word for the introduction of a car toll after persistent resistance from her CDU.
"To be clear, it is in the coalition agreement and it will come," the party chief said Monday after meetings of the CDU's top committees in Berlin.
Merkel did not decide on a detailed model for the time being.
In the black and red government program, "certain parameters" are mentioned.
Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made "a proposal, and it is now being worked on".
However, the NRW-CDU insists on its no toll on all roads.
Merkel stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble (CDU) is also constructively involved in the deliberations for a bill.
In addition to the topic, he also talked to Dobrindt about other possibilities to activate more private capital for investments in infrastructure, such as broadband expansion.
Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble had left a "mirror" report unannounced on Sunday, his house testing its own concept to compensate highway investors with tolls - after the 2017 election.
CSU chief Horst Seehofer warned against developing toll concepts against the leading minister in the cabinet.
CDU Federal Vice-President Armin Laschet reiterated his objections.
"The coalition agreement never assumed that all the county and federal roads would be demolished," said the North Rhine-Westphalian CDU country president.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced to speak again about the issue.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the CDU-Landesverband Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
Background are fears that a toll will affect small border traffic to neighbouring states.
Seehofer had demanded coalition loyalty because of the toll criticism from ranks of the CDU.
The Left considers the plans to have failed in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks Maut is dead," said party leader Bernd Riexinger of the "New Osnabrück Newspaper" (Monday).
Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette duty on all German roads, which is scheduled to start in 2016.
However, according to the coalition agreement, domestic car owners may not be additionally charged.
Therefore, they should receive a full compensation for the toll via the car tax.
However, under EU law, the model must not disadvantage foreign drivers because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder is often misdiagnosed
A Briton says she thought as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost her entire youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from Charcot Marie Tooth Disease (CMT), a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
About 23,000 people in the UK are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, an unsafe gait, and curved toes.
Sick people also suffer from numbness or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed she was suffering from Friedreich-Ataxie (FA), a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in a wheelchair before she turned 18 and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is 51 years old today, said: “As a child, I knew that I couldn’t do the same as the others.
I was constantly falling down and everything took me longer.
I could never ride with the other kids roller skate or skateboard and was often taunted in school because of my way of walking and running.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13 after several operations to relieve her Achilles tendons and stretch her feet, she entered her medical records when her doctor left the room and read that she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I had been curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home looking for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA society," she said.
When I got an answer, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair at 18 and die at 25, and in between would slowly lose all my skills.
I did it all on my own and planned my own funeral.
She said when she turned 17, she realized that her abilities had not diminished as much as she had imagined and questioned her doctor.
He just stood up and hugged me and said, "My love, I don't think you have that, otherwise you'd already be in a wheelchair."
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, their CMT was detected.
“When he told me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner,” she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT Awareness Month to draw attention to this disease.
Staffsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether has been working as a fireworker since the closure of the former troop training ground
For almost ten years, no more shootings have taken place on the former troop training ground in Münsingen.
Nevertheless, deadly munitions still appear every month in the heart of the biosphere area of Swabian Alb.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be blasted on site.
A deafening sound echoes at the blasts over the heart of the biosphere area.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot fell on the Münsingen troop training ground, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since then, the 6500-hectare area has been the core of the Swabian Alb Biosphere Reserve, which is open to hikers and cyclists on 13 designated routes.
Tax burden on business people in Washington area increases with economic recovery
A recovery in the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax rulings for companies in the country rose slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, according to a newly published study last week, and the companies in the Washington area formed no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia area jointly paid $27.6 billion to state and local agencies in 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent compared to 2012 revenues of $26.6 billion.
The state and local tax burden of the companies increased last year by 4.3 percent to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 percent a year earlier, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after the several years of declining rulings in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes rose more than local taxes, by 4.3 percent, according to the study conducted by the Ernst & Young Service Agency with the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district’s tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland’s revenue comes from corporations.
Virginia earns the lowest corporate tax revenue by 28 percent.
Much of the increase in tax revenues is due to a recovery in the company’s property values, the researchers say, which led to an increase in property taxes by 3.7 percent this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While much of these profits came from major states such as California, New York, and Texas, the process also seems to apply to the Washington area.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid over $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 — an increase of 4.2 percent over the course of a year.
But the apparent recovery in real estate values is not as effective in increasing state and local tax revenues in Maryland, as real estate taxes amount to just over one-fifth of corporate tax returns.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay nearly half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes.
"In Maryland, much of the property, especially in the tax area around D.C., is either owned by the government or by non-profit organizations that do not pay property taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, managing director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland, for example, is forced to rely much more on income taxes in order to provide the same services that other states offer.
The recent recovery in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the real estate market
Company revenues also seem to recover, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes on state organizations of $2.3 billion compared to $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland raised $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend is heading in the same direction, the local tax burden for companies does not increase evenly in all three locations.
The rate of increase in the district was 4.3 percent on the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported an under-average tax rate of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax rate in all three areas with 6 percent (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and the district is relatively high 9.975%.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that lower state and local corporate taxes are required in Virginia and overall there is a better tax climate than in Maryland.
The study did not examine the district.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbors.
North Carolina has passed laws to lower its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to achieve its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the state’s corporate income tax rate to 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be better off, and they therefore pay more state and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen – a transitional structure according to which most small businesses are organized – in the District, Maryland and Virginia rose 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, a significantly faster growth rate than corporate taxes overall.
The researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes across the country are likely to continue this year, with a 6.2 percent increase in general multi-agency tax revenues for the state and local governments in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
Nevertheless, the Washington area could be lagging behind if the federal government’s spending cuts affect the labour market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also in China a popular combination.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt’s partner city in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight connection between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt’s partner city of Guangzhou – that is the urgent wish of the officials in China.
“We would be very happy if a German brewery would settle in our city,” said Li Yiwei, vice-party secretary of the South China metropolis, visiting an SPD delegation in his city this week.
Over and over again, the official of the ruling Communist Party of China came back to this concern of the twelve-million-metropolis.
Guangzhou, also known as Canton in Germany, is one of China’s richest cities, Li.
Therefore, people also had the purchasing power to afford German beer.
The Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Sch<0xC3><0xA4>fer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he would be looking in Germany for a possible partner for the project.
"It doesn't take much for beer: good water, grain and joy of life," he added at lunch with the party superior in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already exudes Mr. Li, he flattered the host.
Then the Guangzhou-based official came up with a shepherd's gull - but with red wine, which was served for the meal.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brewing.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German purity law.
More business
A second desire of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice-Party Chief Li.
Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier, but cancelled in 2012 for economic reasons.
“It would be worth it again,” the local politician said.
"Business traffic between our two cities continues to grow".
Currently, travelers would have to take the detour via Changsha in Hunan province, Li complained.
The administration of the province of Guangdong, whose capital is Guangzhou, also hopes for the flight connection.
The vice governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, put this wish to the fore in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," replied Sch<0xC3><0xA4>fer-Gümbel - Chinese Deputy Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate connoisseur of Germany, nodded in agreement.
Well-kept partnership
Guangzhou’s lousy vice-party chief hopes he will be able to visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already at the Main, but not yet in this function.
He came into office only this year after his predecessor had been promoted from office for corruption charges.
Local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to leave.
The action against the Guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the party and administration, which is fiercely enforced by Head of State Xi Jinping.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his party career, which is highly unusual in the Communist Party of China.
Before taking office in Guangzhou, he served as a top official in Fujian, where the automaker VW built a large factory.
Frankfurt has officially entered into more than a dozen city partnerships.
The connection to Guangzhou, which is 9,000 kilometers away, is one of those that are maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
With its economic power, the South China metropolis on the Perl River is almost as strong as all of Hesse.
The next year, it wanted to reach a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, Li reported.
Joan Rivers family "squeezing their thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since being admitted to a hospital in New York City three days ago; however, her daughter was hopeful today that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her illness.
“Thank you for your continued love and support,” Melissa Rivers said in a statement.
We're all pushing our thumbs.
Her mother, according to sources, was hospitalized on Thursday after an emergency for cardiac arrest at a clinic on the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, at Mount Sinai Hospital.
Doctors deliberately keep them sedated and under close observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which is still described as "serious".
The reactions came from many sides, including in the form of overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
More stringent environmental standards will apply to cars and vacuum cleaners that are now available on the market.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will receive a label from September 1st, on which the buyer can at a glance recognize central data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, in the pollutant class "Euro 6" sharper nitrogen oxide values apply.
In addition, there is more money for the scaffolding builders: they receive a nationally uniform minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon to buy Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information had reported on Monday morning: The online retailer—and video producer, and a host of other things—buys the Twitch video streaming service for $1.04 billion (970 million US$).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely believed that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked like the sale of Twitch to Google’s video service was decided for a cool billion, and the collaboration seemed natural as well.
Twitch, founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service – a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to release their favorite pieces in games, a “YouTube for live games,” according to an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which Besserwisser gives the (mostly older) games a touch of secret science theatre, are already very popular on YouTube.
It’s just that YouTube is often called when you want to describe Twitch, so the news that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch was recorded a bit bored, a textbook example of an established tech company that buys a potential competitor.
It’s a mystery why the deal with YouTube didn’t come about, as the company reportedly was willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know about it right now is this statement from Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: “We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster.”
Another secret is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who explain that they prefer to do sports rather than watch them, it’s hard to understand the attraction that assumes watching others while playing rather than even taking control consoles in their hands.
It’s one thing to look at a friend at 3 in the morning as she sneaks through Resident Evil, and something completely different, watching a spinner shoot him in the head 20 times in a row in Call of Duty.
You can watch all these games right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so watching without your own control over the perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the fast-tracks in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronics age complete entire games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as a game or humor virtuoso is not involved, his Twitch channel is probably not that interesting.
But what do skeptics like me already know about it?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic peaks.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money from it?
It’s hard to imagine Twitch being as elegantly integrated into Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Twitch could have easily swallowed.
But Twitch has something every company would like: thousands of young men who are advertised as advertisers.
As the chairman of Twitch, Shear said, Amazon and Twitch “believe both in the future of gaming,” and the medium shows no signs of shrinking, not even – swallowing – as a spectator sport.
There was a lot going on at the Hüpfburg at the Burggartenfest on Sunday evening.
The organizers’ concept was right.
Despite the heavy rain on Saturday evening, an estimated 1,200 music fans attended the open-air festival in the Burggarten.
At times, the entrance had to be stopped.
“That was annoying,” said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel l Light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem have formed the name Amula.
Because the Open Air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten should radiate brightness during the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes on its own anyway.
This was evident early on Sunday evening, when the first visitors opened up to the Open Air.
A celebration for all generations had been promised by the organizers.
And they succeeded.
Salzwedeler, but also guests from the nearby and further surroundings, had made themselves comfortable around the supply stands on the Burggartenwiese.
They followed the first live performances, tipped their feet in the beat, enjoyed cool drinks - in short: pure relaxation and enjoyment were trendy.
And that across the generations.
While some lulled on blankets on the extra-carved white sand at the beach bar, others laded at a quarter of wine in the wine shop, the young man was teasing at the bouncy castle, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But even when making children’s make-up, in the truest sense of the word, the volunteer helpers had to do all their hands to become master of the urge and to conjure imaginative creations into the small faces.
The larger ones used the kicker tables or participated in a skateboard workshop, which the Goodfoot crew of Salzwedel set up.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 5.30 p.m. he bragged to the visitors, especially families looking for the wide and dry.
But the attractiveness of the feast did not break it.
“There were more people than expected,” said Ron Sem, who spoke of a “success all along the line.”
That’s why there’s nothing wrong with a repeat of the big party next year.
Although the content and size of the event still need to be worked on, Sem made clear in a first balance sheet on Sunday compared to the popular vote.
He said the entrance had to be stopped in the meantime.
Apparently, the security company was booked with too little force.
As a result, some who had already paid no longer came to the site.
The response was very good.
In a first cautious estimate, the Salzwedeler co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors who were strolling in the Burggarten.
There were problems with sound engineering.
The hip hop band Blocks<0x60>n<0x60>Rox broke off their appearance.
The technicians were unable to create a semi-reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel because of a tire pan.
“They will be there next year,” said the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula-Open-Air was more than successful in terms of visitor numbers.
And in bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes, which are still forgiven at the first time, but have to be eliminated at the second edition.
Also on the social network Facebook, the organizers have to put in criticism.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you just expected more," Melanie Meier said on the event page.
“Unfortunately, you have taken on a bit,” says Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others don’t see the initial problems so closely.
I think it’s very good that some people not only talk stupidly, but also really try to put something on their feet.
Hat off!" writes Stephanie Jen<0xC3><0x9F> to the amula.
The organizers now have a year to address these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's landmark shrinks
This, as expected, is not the case.
Rather, the ready-to-use component is waiting to be used in the striking structure.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: Almost 50 years after the construction of the TIRA space observation radar, the shell, the so-called radome, is completely renewed.
The new radome will be slightly smaller with a diameter of 47.5 meters than the old one.
The size remains a world record.
The last step to complete the new case is the cap replacement
The upper quarter of the old case is cut off and removed with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new case is set up.
If the weather is in play, the action will be staged at the beginning of this week.
Participant in the Ice-Bucket-Challenge
Isabelle Roberts of Great Britain screamed so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she violated the bone structure of her face.
This ice bucket challenge was painful.
A woman was taken to the hospital after screaming so much at the Ice-Bucket Challenge that she threw herself out of the jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from the United Kingdom was shaking so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she violated her facial structure.
“The water was so cold that I screamed, and while I was doing the deed, my jaw just stopped,” she told The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but it didn't work, the jaw was hooked, and then I realized something wasn't right.
My mother and sister saw this too and almost made themselves in the pants before laughing, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from the UK was hospitalized to reintroduce the jaw after participating in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an internet sensation and thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Will the Burgvereine be back in a row soon?
Last but not least, there was always a dispute between the two Wolfratshauser Burgvereinen.
Now the Boards are thinking about possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Burg, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshauser Burgfreunde, led the project in Guédelon, France.
A year ago there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfreunde Wolfratshausen.
To date, the views on how to deal with the history of the Wolfratshaus Castle and a possible reconstruction seemed to be very different.
Now the two camps are moving towards each other: Talks about a common approach will soon be held.
The board members Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) confirm this at the request of our newspaper.
"I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we could sit down once," Sjöberg reports.
In his view, all the members of both clubs could pull back together in the future.
Thus, visible successes can be seen more quickly.
While the Burgfreunde had in mind until recently a reconstruction of the castle on the Bergwald, the "development and experience" of the site is at the forefront of the Burgverein around Sjöberg.
Herbert Piffl, second chairman of the Burgfreunde, was very pleased with the call, according to his own information.
Since Dimbath's death, he has been in front of his castle friends.
A new chairman will be found at a general meeting in mid-September.
According to the 74-year-old, the club currently has around 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we initially let the club activities rest out of respect". This "thinking phase" was necessary to "consider how it could proceed".
According to Piffl, the new chairman should then enter the conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, the Burgfreunde could also make themselves a current mood picture within their grouping.
There is currently no candidate for the presidency, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find themselves" He himself does not want to run because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer wanted to work on the project "but very much would like to continue working on it".
The different points of view in terms of reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffls in the near future.
He honors Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, well-advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an airlock.
Due to the high participation of the population as well as by volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I was also skeptical at the beginning.
But over time, I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to push the project forward. A "self-employment feature" could be created for the Flö<0xC3><0x9F>erstadt.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project could be financed by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"I personally do not want to throw the idea of reconstruction overboard", he hopes that the Burgverein may be moving somewhat in this regard.
Their goal of documenting the story first is "important and good".
After that, you could keep looking.
Clever Ways to Save on Uni textbooks
As the cost of university textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 per year, fast-second-semester student Matt Schroeder considered a clever savings idea.
He invented a loan system for books for students of higher semesters and offered a nominal compensation to delay the resale.
"My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a chick-fil-A cookie," said Schroeder, 19, who attended Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college board announced that students spend on average more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and study materials, but that there would be different cost reduction options for students.
Online shops and creative approaches such as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
Renting textbooks is becoming more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much cheaper price than buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookstores, said the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books were rented in college books last spring semester, Neebo’s vice president, Trevor Meyer, said.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased in campus books, according to the National Association of College Stores.
Here's the one-off for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books cost online only a third of the price for which they are available in the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" by Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be purchased from the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buy used
If you don’t mind the notes of other or normal usage traces, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is needed on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a second-hand edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, advised students to ask their professors if previous expenses were allowed.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant to the seminar work.
In such cases, older expenses can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest expense.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, Half.com from eBay Inc is a popular alternative to used books.
Rent
Renting textbooks is worth considering if you treat them fairly well, remember to return them and you don’t want to keep the books after completing the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Find out about the rules of the business where you rent, including the penalty fees that may apply to writing notes, underlines or traces of use.
Pay attention to tenants: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-books
E-books instead of conventional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time from wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg, and Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers, as many classics today can be downloaded for free, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Definitely look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon attend Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for pricing books, as you can be so sure to find the right textbook.
And before an online order, you should check, so Gault, whether the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson on the hard way.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery time and eventually paid the full price in the college bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" didn't turn out to be a cashier
Sylvester Stallone's "The Expendables 3" recorded less than $30 million of his $90 million budget in the U.S., while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" recorded just $12 million of his $70 million budget.
The Cameron Diaz-tailed film "Sex Tape" only grossed $14.6 million at the opening weekend, while children's films such as "Dragon Taming Made Easy 2" also disappoint in revenue.
An article by Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that the lack of quality in the films themselves could be the reason for the children’s films.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year" so far for children's films and described "dragon tame easily made 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy sequel.
However, when it comes to films for a slightly older audience, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic rating for each summer movie launch, which was shown on at least 2,000 screens between Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and the current year.
The results are based on the opinion of cinemagoers and film critics and suggest that this year’s film hits are equivalent to those of last year.
Some commentators believe that the evolution is due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney’s soon-to-be-released Jungle Book movie, told Hollywood Reporter: “I think the times are changing.”
We have to accept this and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash-out results of Hollywood productions, Netflix recently generated revenue with streaming content of $1.2 billion, almost twice as much as last year, in which revenue was $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on filming comics and predicting a “core meltdown” of Hollywood.
In light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that its gloomy prophecy may well contain a true core.
However, due to the potential box office hits expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline in checkout results as simply “cyclical” and told Hollywood Reporter: “Next summer will be the biggest summer at the box office ever, and nobody will worry about the business anymore.”
When the 2nd table tennis district class was removed a few years ago to tighten the league division, this has been a step in the right direction.
The German Tischtennisbund has now added an additional 3rd Bundesliga to the programme.
As a result, those who have not ascended have descended.
Göttingen’s highest-class team Torpedo has avoided the descent in the Oberliga relegation, but will only play fifth-class in the coming season.
Torpedos ladies remain fourth-class despite their grandiose march into the Regionalliga.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony League, as well as the boys of the SC Weende.
The SG Lenglern and the Torpedo Reserves will take place in the new Verbandsliga, and Göttingen clubs will no longer be represented in the Landesliga.
For the ladies, the TTV Geismar plays in the Verbandsliga, the torpedo second in the Landesliga.
What looks like a better district class is now the new district league South.
TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and TTC will take place here.
In the district league play as regional representatives Dransfeld and SC Weende, in the district class of TTC II, Red-White, the Bovender SV II and the teams of TTV Geismar II and III.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are part of the game.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen start in the district league.
With nine teams each
The SC Weende sends his girls to the small district league.
The SCW boys' district league squad - which is still launching Torpedo II - is also not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Bovender SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two Göttinger Kreisligen start with nine teams each.
In the West Staff are the Red-White II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
In the Eastern Staff there are, among others, Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen.
The women's circuit consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the Osterode district, where there are no more women’s teams at the county level.
What is striking is that none of the six 2nd circular classes will reach their desired strength, and here the innovative and agile circuit board will have to think about it.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend there were protests by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport for an anti-Nato march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the local city hall to hold a so-called counter summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the developments on the weekend and spoke to demonstrators who travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers fled the Blue Mountains
Two young bush walkers were brought to safety with the rope winch after being trapped overnight in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
The 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man set out for their tour shortly after Sunday afternoon in Govett’s Leap in Blackheath.
Concerned relatives called the police at about 8 p.m. when the two had not returned home.
A search crew from local police and rescue services broke up and the couple were found near the Bridal Veil waterfalls at about 11 p.m.
The girl had injured herself on her knee and the man had fallen and had hit his head.
Rescuers stayed with the couple overnight, and they were flown out on Monday morning.
They were delivered to Blue Mountains Hospital in a stable condition with an ambulance.
Anti-government protests in Pakistan are escalating
The approximately 1,000 demonstrators were pushed out of the PTV building by soldiers, said Minister of Information Pervaiz Rashid.
The transmitter resumed broadcasting after about half an hour.
PTV director Athar Farooq said the protesters equipped with sticks had damaged devices in the editorial office.
The dead or injured were not reported.
Protesters demand the resignation of the head of government to whom they accuse election fraud.
Police said about a mile away from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s residence there had been clashes with security forces of some 3,000 demonstrators on Monday.
According to hospital records, a police officer was injured.
Over the weekend, at least three people were killed and more than 500 were injured as protesters tried to advance to Sharif’s residence.
They demand the resignation of the Prime Minister.
The powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict on Sunday evening, after a meeting at the Army Headquarters, "to waste no time and to use it without violence."
The statement further stated: “The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state.”
The escalating violence has raised concerns about military intervention, which has already been more frequent in the past.
The protests led by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri have been ongoing since Independence Day on August 14.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had called on their supporters on Sunday to stand out.
“We will not go back without forcing Sharif to resign,” Khan said.
Qadri said the same thing.
Khan accuses Sharif of winning the parliamentary election last May through fraud.
Qadri calls for the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government should reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are deployed to protect the government district.
The protesters had initially peacefully held out in front of parliament until Khan and Qadri called for them to advance to Sharif's residence on the weekend.
Hütteldorfer after second season win in third place of the table.
With the 2-0 over Grödig, a bitter week on Sunday has come to an amicable end for Rapid.
"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate low with the Out in the Europa League on Thursday.
"The success experience was incredibly important," confirmed captain and goalkeeper Steffen Hofmann, who advanced to third place with green-white.
Schrammel-Traumtor brings Rapid to the winner’s road Rapid has shown the correct reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki with the second victory of the season and goes into the national game break with a successful experience.
“We wanted to show a positive response,” said defending champion Thomas Schrammel, who, with his magnificent lead volley from the sixteenth corner in the 14th minute, set the course for victory.
“I thought I’d get all the frustration out of Thursday and put it under the latte,” the 26-year-old said smiling.
When Schrammel met in a Bundesliga match on 13 Novmember 2010 for the last time, it was still for Ried.
The first champion in the Rapid-Dress will therefore remain in his special memory.
“For me, this is something very special, I’m from the rapid offspring,” Schrammel said.
Due to the short-term pelvic injury of Mario Pavelic, Schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and also did his thing very well there.
He has enough experience that he can also practice this position in a mirrored way.
He has earned the goal, he has already done a few assists this year," praised Barisic.
Team shows character Schrammel also delivered the flank to 2:0 by Hofmann after about an hour, which finally made the decision.
The guests could have written about it.
“Thanks to God, we’ve had some luck today,” Schrammel remarked, who pointed to the breakdown of performance and result over the past few weeks: “The results haven’t been right, but the gameplay has always been good compared to last year.”
Barisic even said he had been "better in many games before than today" - against "the strongest team that played in this season at this stadium".
The first three points since 26 July have therefore proved that the team structure is intact despite the setbacks: "Today my team has shown that it has character".
For him no less gratifying: "That we have finally played to zero again".
Much work during the national game break Also the fact that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger there are several failures to complain about, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their start-up debuts, make the victory even more valuable.
"You must not forget this," warned Barisic, who has lost players in the past three days with Behrendt and Pavelic, "who have been very stable lately."
The national game break must therefore be used to "leak wounds and increase a bit in the physical area," said Barisic, who has five U21 selectors in his ranks.
One to which the break seems to be particularly convenient is Captain Hofmann.
He breaks up for the team, goes over pain.
At this very difficult stage, he has shown that he is a very important player for us,” Barisic said.
Hofmann not only gave the game to Rapids before his 68th minute exchange, but also scored the second goal.
For the 33-year-old who completed his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first hit out of the game since November 2, 2013 (4:2 via the Admira).
Hofmann: "Don't believe that everything is good now" "We've probably had a bit of luck too, but at some point the luck must come back to us as well.
Now it was high time," Hofmann said.
Of course, he insisted on concentrated further work: "You can't always see this in black and white.
We haven’t played as badly in the last few weeks as we’ve seen.
But we must not believe that everything is good now.
He could not deny the importance of his role for the team.
It's a very young team that I can help a lot at the moment.
At certain stages, they stick to me,” Hofmann said.
Grödig coach Michael Baur had little to blame for himself and his team.
He regretted the quick match "from the Magic Gate category", as well as the regular goal of Nutz in the 40th minute, which had been wrongly dismissed by referee Kollegger.
The only accusation I can make to the team is that we were not concrete enough towards the goal in some phases.
We have had too few degrees.
Interior defender Maximilian Karner saw it similarly: "It started just as badly, but then we found it clean and even made a goal.
On the whole, there would have been more in it.
Under this rock there is calm
We showed a powerful tribe at our puzzle edition of the summer series "My Piece of Rhöner Glück" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants still exist in the county, the specimen shown is the "Gei<0xC3><0x9F>ruheiche" above Unterwei<0xC3><0x9F>enbrunn.
A bumpy footpath leads up to the approximately 600-year-old oak.
It passes by couplers, basalt stone piles and basalt stone lakes.
A little below the quarry from Bauersberg, a kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, there it stands.
Vital looks like the natural monument, it protrudes beyond the other trees of the surrounding area and, with a circumference of over eight meters, resembles an American mammoth tree.
A small Buddha on a tree stump indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
However, despite intensive research, there were only indications of the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has also consulted the Bischofsheimer Archive and asked older people from Unterwei<0xC3><0x9F>enbrunn to find out what they think of the Gei<0xC3><0x9F>ruheiche.
The result of his research remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
Thus, until about 80 years ago, the goat herders were said to have driven their animals from underwhite well to the tediously ridden and stone-free meadows.
At the foot of the tree, the animal keepers exhausted from the ascent are said to have rested.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because in the meadows, goat herds are actually grazing again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider further found out.
When entering the stone accumulations, however, caution should be exercised, because the basalt warmed by the sun is also a popular place for crucifixions.
A hiking trail leads from Unterwei<0xC3><0x9F>enbrunn to the tree, which is a bit hidden.
Further paths are signposted, ascend the direction Hochrhön and invite you to an extensive hike.
Where is the water castle?
However, a water castle, which is sought during our next task, is rarely found at altitude.
The reflection in the trench already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historical buildings in the county that could fit the building counterfei.
Where is our "piece of Rhöner Glück"?
My piece Rhöner Glück

The most beautiful photos will be published.
After weeks of thawing, Italy’s Prime Minister and acting EU Chairman, Matteo Renzi, has passed the nomination of his foreign minister Federica Mogherini as head of EU foreign policy last week against strong conservative opposition at the EU Special Summit, becoming the successor of British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers how the pro-government daily La Repubblica reproduces the vocation of his Mogherini, who is also a favorite in the government team, as strengthening the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost for his "reform package" in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes to calm down the left-wing party base that is constantly running against him, because Mogherini is assigned to this – albeit rather in a moderate manner.
Contrary to the conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Poland nominated as President of the Council, Donald Tusk is, according to the prevailing opinion in Rome, thus establishing a political balance.
At the same time, the EU’s chief diplomat will be Vice-President Juncker.
The remaining approval of the European Parliament is considered to be secure.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) an "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica is spreading optimism that the Mogherini, who has been tried for almost two decades in leading party offices and known for their ambition, will be able to face the "enormous challenges".
The native Roman woman is married and has two daughters.
She began her political career in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (Left-Democrats), which in 2008 merged with the Catholic Centre Party Margherita into today's Social Democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth (European Young Socialists) for three years.
With the election of 2001 in the Party Council of the Left Democrats, she entered into high party politics, working in the Foreign Policy Department, whose leader she soon became.
It occupied traditional focal points of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, was announced by studies on NATO deployment in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a contingent of troops, maintained contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and the Democrats in the United States.
Since 2008, she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, where she is an expert on defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became Prime Minister in February 2014, he appointed Mogherini as his Foreign Minister.
If the PD again has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the more than 40 percent of the party’s votes in the EU elections in May, then, as noted in PD circles, Federica Mogherini has a share in it.
The reservations in Brussels, the new EU foreign agent has too little diplomatic experience, so if there is a lack of substance, the PD is countered.
In Brussels, especially Poland and the Baltics, distrustful and realistic accents of Mogherinis on the crisis in Ukraine are being pursued and defamed as a "Russia-friendly course".
It advocates the pipeline South Stream operated by the Russian company Gasprom, through which Russian natural gas is to be transported directly to southern Europe, bypassing Ukraine, which also serves the energy security of Italy.
After Renzi took office as EU president in July, Mogherini travelled to Moscow for her first state visit.
Photos they showed with Putin at the shake-hands were taken with outrage in Brussels, as well as inviting the Kremlin chief to a Milan economic summit for October.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among them is an apprentice who has already completed another training in the company before.
In the future, the new employees will work in four training professions: electronics (three trainees), mechatronics (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All trainees come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg vor Wald, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd and Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees previously visited primary and secondary schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainees of all ages as well as the instructors will go to a team-building event to Oberammergau, where among other things, a full-day hike and rafting on the Inn are on the programme.
The company has 435 employees throughout Germany and 950 employees worldwide.
The number of trainees distributed over all years is 27.
The socialists in France should “hold their mouths and put France in order,” said Francois Hollande’s main ally.
Mr. Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "their love" for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet reform has been met with disapproval by the vast majority of the French.
The president deserves everyone’s respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay by his side," he said with great applause.
The prime minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite fierce demands for a easing of the regime on the part of Emmanuel Macron, the new economy ministers.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande had urged his fellow socialists to show themselves "united" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, scattered sand into the gear in which she appeared at a meeting of apostates of socialist MPs and criticized the Socialist Party for taking the French "faith in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, mocked the socialists’ constant trench battles and said they couldn’t imagine the new Valls government going through for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls also has none, they are forced to form a new government if the old one has not even survived a summer.
"And the new one won't survive autumn or winter either," Ms. Le Pen told supporters.
She reiterated her party’s call for a dissolution of parliament and said she was confident to emerge victorious in early elections and was ready for the government.
The ruling party of France suffered a defeat in the March municipal elections and the right-wing National Front was ahead of the May EU elections.
A poll in the Sunday Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of the French believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of falling into several rival factions before the end of the 2017 Dutch term.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and record unemployment rates.
"There is a small window of opportunity, but public opinion must quickly feel that things are changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could deteriorate further.
Norwegian Cruise just before a deal with Prestige Cruises of $3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise provider in the world, is leading advanced negotiations to acquire the competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion, according to industry experts.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to Prestige Cruises’ luxury cruise ships and its wealthy clientele, while competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could already be announced this week, the sources said on Sunday and warned that the talks could also end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous, as the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a spokesman for Apollo declined a comment.
The Miami-based company Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue in 2013 was $2.57 billion, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which jointly operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenues for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry totals around $29 billion and in the coming years is expected to do so due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging markets such as China and India.
The companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice for these new customers at the cruise providers.
Prestige Cruises applied to the U.S. regulators for the IPO in January 2014.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder in the company since an $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was formed in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise provider owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino mixed company under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went on the stock exchange in January 2013.
Genting held 28 percent of the shares, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP a 8 percent share in the company at the end of June, according to regulatory authorities.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise have, according to the original application documents for the IPO of Prestige Cruises, more than 82 percent of the passenger capacity of American cruise ships.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China on the day after the election decision.
A peking group swung near the Chinese flag.
On Sunday, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress passed a framework law allowing only two or three candidates for the 2017 leadership election in Hong Kong.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be staffed with peking loyal members.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition Democrats to be admitted to the election, prompting pro-democracy activists to face their threat and paralyze Hong Kong’s financial center with Occupy Central protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong; and China’s party leadership fears that the calls for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper in which China’s dominance over Hong Kong was outlined in June, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the Special Administrative Region, where hundreds of thousands marched into the city’s business district and organized a sit-in there.
Li’s survey is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The Deputy Chairman of the Legal Commission of the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun, and the Vice-Director of the Hong Kong and Macau Offices of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be consulted during the day.
Student activists announced that they would meet in Hong Kong in the afternoon in front of the top office.
Until the final phase of the 150-year-old colonial government in Hong Kong, Britain did not foresee any democratic elements.
Putin urges Kiev to host "statehood talks" with eastern Ukraine
According to Russian media reports on Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded that the Ukrainian government halt the fighting against the separatists in the eastern part of the country and immediately start negotiations on the "statehood" of the apostate region.
His spokesman Dimitri Peskov later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the territory of eastern Ukraine under the control of the separatists would become a part of Russia, but that its status towards Ukraine would have to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin’s appeal to the Kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents, however, fits the strategy he has been pursuing since the start of the riots five months ago: aid for the separatists in taking territories and pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed region of Novorossiya factual independence for an alliance with Russia instead of with the West.
In an interview with the state television channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to reconquer the separatist-held territories in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were captured in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently referred to the occupied territory as "Novorossiya" or "New Russia", a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary heyday of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the course of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on Oct. 26 and while government groups attack civilian communities in the areas held by separatists, hope for early peace talks "are trapped in their illusions," Itar-Tass reported.
"We need to start discussions immediately, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organisation of society and the state status of South East Ukraine, in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said Putin’s reference to statehood must be seen in the context of greater autonomy, which has been discussed for months by the Kiev leadership to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern territories the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
It is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, “because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine.”
The Kremlin spokesman’s clarification to correct the “wrong interpretation” of Putin’s remarks underscored Russia’s leadership’s claim to dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East as opposed to the direct annexation of Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulty annexing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and polls from the pre-conflict period yielded a broad majority for remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomats on international forums would empower regional governments in Ukraine to negotiate their own trade agreements and foreign relations, thus giving the Kremlin de facto control over an area that connects the Russian state area with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, which was annexed five months ago, is the home port for most of the Russian Navy, as well as an important trading port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov area in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, in his speech to the inauguration on June 7, proposed that Ukrainian legislation - after re-election - should consider additions to the constitution, which would give the respective territories greater control over their finances and the status of the languages.
But his notion of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose armament and incitement is accused of Moscow.
Putin’s last call to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders on an equal footing followed a further advance by the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks crossed the previously peaceful region along the Azov Sea into eastern Ukraine.
The Russian-backed separatists took control of Novoasovsk, according to fears of Ukrainian security officials, the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region up to Crimea.
For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations have been underway to secure Mariupol, a steel industrial port with 500,000 inhabitants located between Novoasovsk and the narrow access to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels and called for urgent action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are about to reach a point where there is no going back," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not decide on concrete actions, the leadership called for the drafting of further sanctions against Russia to enter into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovajsk after two Russian tank columns and 1,000 soldiers entered the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, said Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council Reports on Saturday in Kiev.
The first likely 63 Ukrainian soldiers trapped by the Russian invasion of Ilovajsk were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers who had been captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Nude photo scandal surrounding Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten didn’t make a hell of his anger over hackers who allegedly stole nude pictures of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and a Who is Who of the Hollywood A-Promises.
The film city is in a state of excitement after a series of unequivocal photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence have appeared on the Internet in a hacking scandal surrounding celebrities.
The hacker in charge probably has 60 nude photos of Lawrence, Star from "the Tribute of Panem" and of superstars, including models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne reportedly also made private photos public due to an iCloud gap.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Most nobles who had engaged to Grecko last month said to Confidential, "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, currently in New York, reportedly told a news website that the hack was “harmful” and that those affected felt “injured.”
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots in which she lies on top without in a pool.
Palmer's films include "Love is Invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available yesterday for comments on the hacked images.
A representative of Lawrence' said to TMZ, "It's an abominable violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: “Posting hacked images from a cell phone is nothing but selling Hehlerware.”
Legally speaking, the redistribution of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Yesterday, cyclists, joggers and hikers participated in the 8th Cycling on the Gro<0xC3><0x9F>e Feldberg and thus supported the association "Help for children with cancer".
The tour, which was a torture for one, was an easy training for the other.
But in one thing, everyone agreed: it was fun.
Thomas Studanski probably slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberurseler Brauhaus took the bike to the Feldberg yesterday.
For the good cause.
He can easily put away the small muscle cat, especially since he had personally brought a valuable insight to the 8th Cycling on the Gro<0xC3><0x9F>e Feldberg in favour of the association "Help for children with cancer" (Frankfurt).
It's a great thing.
"I know now that I can do it - fine!"
Small pimples on the go in the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been off...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Oberurseler Stadtparliament, many of the 718 participants were tormented yesterday in the morning rope to mountains and came close to exhaustion, but happily arrived on the plateau.
Others, on the other hand, found it easier to overcome the distance between Hohemark and Feldberg for about 11 kilometres.
Norman Die<0xC3><0x9F>ner, for example.
The Green Politician from the Circle Day - red dress, red bike - made at the start something on understatement ("Every lot of professionals, there's a destination!"), but then turned out to be half a professional on the mountain and went through the destination after 45 minutes without breathing.
He also went through the track in a slide, as did Nina Kuhn, a press spokesperson for the city of Oberursel, who had set out together with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg-Radelen" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This is about charity, we are happy to be there - we would have made an exit today anyway," Kuhn said.
Along the way they met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had gone down to Oberursel in the morning, to tighten up immediately afterwards.
In the morning at 9 a.m., the Frankfurter Florian Zierz had swung himself into the saddle at home, "made" the Feldberg twice, and then rolled home with fun.
Also had fun "Free-Toni".
For the head of the Oberurseler Kultkiosks, cycling tours over the Feldberg are easy.
He had scored 40 minutes with his 6.5-kilometer race bike.
It's a crazy event.
For this purpose - I like to be there," said Andreas Balzke.
The well-trained Mainzer says of himself that he is an "ambitious racing cyclist".
He has to be, because he was on the road with the "Fixie-Rad", these are also racing bikes, but without circuit...
The fact that it was easy to climb up even without a bike proved not only the 20 hikers who climbed up to the summit via the White Wall and the fox dance, but also a jogger who pulled behind a car tire with weights on a cord.
Bergwacht doctor Professor Volker Lischke, who, with his team, equipped with all-wheel-Bully and Quad, ensured safety, said: "I know him from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sled trail, only that he pulls the sled himself". So the man is, to a certain extent, his own sled dog.
The 718 participants – and thus as many as never before – had been sent in groups on the track in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30 a.m.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 a.m.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers set off.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the "Radeln auf de Gro<0xC3><0x9F>e Feldberg" association, gave the starting commands and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year, he hopes that he will be able to block the route to the Feldberg up to the safety of the participants.
