Gutach: Even more safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 meters away from each other: On Tuesday, the new B 33 pedestrian ramp has been put into operation in Gutach at the village car park - within sight of the older town hall traffic light.
Two plants so close together: intent or shield citizen strike?
Gutach’s mayor answered this question clearly yesterday.
"The town hall light was installed at the time because it secures the school path," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser traffic lights secure both cyclists and bus passengers and the Bergle residents.
The plant officially commissioned yesterday was important for the crossing area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
We have the museum, two churches, the spa park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area <0xE2><0x80><0xBA>Grub<0xE2><0x80><0xB9>.
"In the case of the high traffic and pedestrian volume, another traffic light had to be produced for their safety," Eckert said.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of the Offenburg Landratsamt.
"According to current measurements on the B 33, about 12,000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach every day, of which about ten percent are heavy-duty traffic," Arnold emphasizes.
Therefore, the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary: "Security is simply taking place here," says Arnold.
A total of four traffic shows had been carried out, a roundabout was also planned, but because of the narrowness in the crossing area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstra<0xC3><0x9F>e was again discarded.
According to Arnold, everything was tested in the location selection of the traffic light poles: "We have equipped the means of a transporter loaded extra for us with particularly long logs, whether these vehicles can drive out of the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without bending the traffic light poles".
The 15,000 euro traffic light system itself is the "most modern thing on the market at the moment," Arnold explained.
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs that shine so brightly that the lights of the drivers can be clearly seen, for example, even in the case of low sun.
And it is also economical: the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technology of the new plant: it is equipped with two radar sensors.
When the pedestrian presses the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is free, immediately green comes for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be terminated.
“If a group or disabled people walk across the street, the green phase is extended, so everyone is safe on the road,” Arnold explained.
Of course, the driver has to think along as a partner here and watch the road.
This was not the case yesterday: hardly showed the traffic light for pedestrians green, a top-class vehicle rushed through - in bright red.
Josef Winkler has been writing about the needs of his childhood and youth from the soul for more than 30 years.
The catastrophes of his Catholic village-child - the speechlessness, the slope to raw violence and blunt sexuality, the narrowness and joylessness - have often been described by the Carinthian poet.
The Büchner Prize winner is mainly known as a prose author, theatre texts are rare in his work.
Gerhard Fresacher presents a collage of prose texts for his performance "Weather lamps on the tip of the tongue", which can now be seen in the garage X at Petersplatz.
The theatre maker, for example, combines elements from the autobiographical novel "Der Leib<0xC3><0xA4>igene" (1987) with prosaminiatures from "Leichnam, belauerdend his familien" (2003).
On the largely empty-roomed stage - important prop: a smashed sofa, on which the impression is copulated and masturbated - the eight-headed ensemble hangs itself through the text material.
Director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance surpasses the template with a wealth of directorial touches, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play.
Especially the actresses come up with the sometimes somewhat questionable scenario implementations.
They are touched hard, dipped in water with their head, tucked on the wall with their evening robes.
Forced into cellophane or boar, they stick to dangerously high studs by staging, either monologize them loudly or lie completely silently on the stage floor.
However, the text hardly conveys itself in this strained way.
The best moments have the evening when singing - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to folk songs.
Only towards the end comes the overturned performance somewhat to rest, and Winkler’s straight-forward absurd humor flashes up.
A black box in the car?
U.S. road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that finds its place in the dashboard of each car.
The devices that record every kilometre driven and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the state planning offices to revise the outdated system for financing U.S. roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups and advocate for the government to use the small boxes to record the kilometres driven – and possibly also where they were driven – and then use the information to calculate tax returns.
The tea party is horrified.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
But while Congress cannot agree on a course of action, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently examining how they can switch over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per mile driven.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a must for our country.
“It’s not something we’ll only possibly use,” said Hasan Ikhrata, CEO of Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plans to record the miles driven by all California drivers in the state starting in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for this is here.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded from the taxes, is bankrupting the U.S. taxpayers at the warhead.
In America, however, there is not as much thought as before.
Cars consume less fuel.
The state mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 eurocents per liter) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax even by one cent at high fuel prices.
“The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, an expert on traffic legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system.
“This is the most meaningful option in the long term,” he said.
Bureaucrats call it a mile-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea resonates with urban liberals, because the tax could be used, for example, to influence driving behaviour in such a way that congestion and climate-damaging exhaust gases are reduced.
California planners are using the system to develop strategies to achieve the state’s ambitious, legally-announced goals for climate change.
But Pennsylvania Republican Bill Shuster, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also motivated by the idea of having drivers pay for the distance covered.
“This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, Vice President of Policy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers who, in a 2011 report, asked Congress to move toward mile-based billing.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a $90 million expensive pilot project that would have included 10,000 cars.
However, the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the advance and thus responded to the concerns of rural MPs representing people who often have to travel many miles on their way to work or to the city on a daily basis.
Nevertheless, several states and major cities are moving in this direction on their own.
The most engaged is Oregon, which currently recruits 5,000 drivers for the country’s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering this.
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transportation ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is currently investigating how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment, drivers were skeptical about the idea that the government could track any of their movements.
“Concerning Big Brother and things like that was a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and profit management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
People didn't want it.
When the test started, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to turn the tachographs into adult surveillance devices.”
There is no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to capture data about the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that allows the state to capture the miles driven, but not exactly when and where.
So, Khan said, the public would also be calmer.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company originally did not start to help states tax drivers.
Rather, their goal was to gain a foothold in an emerging car insurance market where drivers are expected to pay based on miles driven.
But the devices tested by it are also interesting for road planners, because they do not work with GPS and only provide limited information, which is regularly uploaded by modem.
“People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded,” said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
Major mistakes were made in some of these public pilot programmes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers a range of choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they choose no device at all and instead pay a flat fee based on the average miles driven by all residents of the state.
Other agencies hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more features than with fewer.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a tax-paying device that also allows parking fees to be paid, insurance only has to be paid for miles driven, and speed data is collected from other vehicles in real time, thanks to which drivers can avoid traffic jams.
“Automobiles would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system,” the city’s planning document states.
However, some traffic planners wonder whether the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction maneuver.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials said Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by increasing fuel taxes.
An additional one-off fee or annual fee could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little gasoline, so that they also pay a fair share.
“There is no reason for surgery if an aspirin is sufficient,” said Randy Rentschler, the Commission’s head of legislation and public affairs.
When we do, hundreds of millions of drivers worry about their privacy and numerous other things.
King's Field: Small Team Strikes Wacker
The volunteer fire brigade managed their autumn main sample despite staff shortages with bravour.
Only eleven men took part in the exercise.
Department commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the estate pen in Burgberger Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e in his acceptance of the exercise.
A short circuit is said to have been created during sawing.
Due to the resulting fire and smoke development, two people were injured, but one of them was still able to send an emergency call.
After the first review of the situation by Hans Kammerer, two Wehr respiratory guards made themselves ready to enter the building.
After a short time, it was possible to find the first person and lead them out into the open.
The second person had to be carried.
This was not so easy, as a narrow staircase was also to be overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stables for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood and straw balls in it.
There were also electric machines for woodworking.
The first extinguishing attack took place via the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was carried out via a superfluous hydrant about 100 meters away.
Three extinguishing attacks could now be carried out.
A hollow jet tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer also discussed what to do with little available staff.
In the event of an emergency, support will be provided by the day-to-day operations group Königsfeld.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies important
During his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, President Guido Wolf was also informed in Titisee-Neustadt about where the workers of tomorrow come from.
In the Hochschwarzwald funding centre, he worked with the senior managers of the vocational schools as well as the district gymnasium and the parents’ board chairmen on this important question.
"Education is an important location factor," stressed Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma-Schule, which presented the connected school project Bildungszentrum Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation between the funding centre, the district gymnasium and the vocational school centre in the forest city.
He also praised family friendliness in the county.
"It is important not only to keep an eye on the family phase, but also the phase of caring for relatives due to demographic change," Wolf explained.
He also stated that more and more employees took care of the care and care of their relatives.
“Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship,” Wolf said.
But no one can afford to lose qualified workers, he said.
Another, particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
“For those who have already learned about the region’s benefits during their studies, their acquired knowledge and skills often help the regional economy to strengthen the region,” the country’s president said.
Because only if sufficient training places were offered can the need for skilled workers be met.
In his opinion, the district’s location advantage is its advantageous location in southwestern Germany, close to France and Switzerland.
On his journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he also experienced the efforts already made to expand public transport.
“Stay persistent and ensure that public transport improves,” he told the local police.
Experience a fun afternoon with music
For 15 years, the Kaul family has been inviting the Dietinger seniors to coffee, cake and afterwards to a vesper.
In the past, the elderly were accommodated in the resting place.
Meanwhile, this afternoon takes place in the nursing home of St. Josef.
The locals were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later there was sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich had a conversation with popular melodies.
The more than 100-year-old natural stone wall as the front demarcation of the old schoolyard to Kirchstra<0xC3><0x9F>e, which is in front of the renovation, is to be placed once again on the renovation cost plan of the city of Br<0xC3><0xA4>unlingen.
In the days before Kilbig, during the first works of the renovation of the front schoolyard, a small angular wall was installed, for stabilization and static relief of the more than one hundred years old natural stone wall with balustrade.
According to Alexander Misok of the Br<0xC3><0xA4>unlinger Stadtbauamt, the further procedure is to include the Landesdenkmalamt in the planning and to create a renovation concept for the old wall.
After that, a cost calculation will be carried out by experts, who will then be put on the table for the municipal council to decide and determine the further procedure.
A decision on this is expected to be made in the coming year.
After the renovation, paving and tree planting of the old school courtyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, in the foreseeable future as a follow-up measure, the remediation-needing boundary wall must be renovated from the ground up and placed on new substructure.
The historic, one hundred-year-old boundary wall of the old schoolyard to the Kirchstra<0xC3><0x9F>e, is mainly due to water and frost damage, since there is no drainage, need for renovation and has an arch inclination forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones testify to weather damage, but the wall is not currently at risk of collapse.
A sturdy wall is a prerequisite for a schoolyard used by students, which is done by the current fastening work.
Originally, the schoolyard renovation was planned even in 2008/2009, but high unscheduled expenditures brought a shift.
An important word in the historical school wall renovation, which has even been used for filming, will be spoken by the state memorial office.
If specifications come from this site, then the city of Br<0xC3><0xA4>unlingen hopes for grants from the monument protectors.
The students of Br<0xC3><0xA4>unlinger Primary School, who are now being taught in a well-renovated old school building with a new aula, can soon use the old schoolyard.
<0xC3><0x96>zdemir to receive jazz training in Stuttgart
Cem <0xC3><0x96>zdemir, Federal Chairman of the Greens, has now also engaged in the ongoing discussions about the future of the music universities in Baden-Württemberg.
"I think it's wrong to give up the holistic education at the Stuttgart Music University," <0xC3><0x96>zdemir told the "Stuttgarter Nachrichten".
Jazz and classical music belong together at the jazz venue Stuttgart.
This contradicts <0xC3><0x96>zdemir, who is considered a favorite in Stuttgart for a direct mandate in the Bundestag elections on 22 September, the Green-Red state government.
On the basis of an expert study, this requires a reorganisation of the five music universities in Baden-Württemberg.
Afterwards, the Jazz and Pop degree program will be transferred from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim.
U.S. border: "Super-tunnel" discovered for drug smuggling
On the border between Mexico and the United States, investigators have discovered and shut down a “super tunnel” to drug smuggling.
As the U.S. customs authorities said, the more than 500-metre-long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, rail rails and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were arrested, eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine confiscated.
The tunnel had not yet been used.
“These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig under the radar,” said U.S. District Attorney General Laura Duffy at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where one end of the tunnel had been discovered.
Duffy told the drug gangs: “If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make that a huge waste of your dirty money.”
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a long-term fight against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Constructed by experts
Due to the elaborate equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The track system was equipped in such a way that electrically operated cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, the access is located in a building that is 80 meters from the border.
According to authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters into the depth to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters in height and 90 centimeters in width.
It would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration to the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine discovery.
The third, a Mexican, was arrested for confiscating marijuana.
All three are facing the maximum sentence of life imprisonment, officials said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels have been discovered, it said at the San Diego press conference.
This is the first time cocaine has been found in such a tunnel.
Cocaine is usually smuggled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels.
This shows the "desperation" of drug gangs whose traditional routes have since been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the drug-trafficking DEA in San Diego.
They would do anything to get to the United States.
No details were disclosed to the detainees, at least one being Mexican.
You must expect prison sentences of up to ten years.
2014 will be Geisinger Fest Year
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
The return of the first documentary mention is getting closer and closer.
When the year comes to an end in just eight weeks, the anniversary year is on.
Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen were first mentioned together in 794.
In churches, a document was made, in which both places are mentioned.
On 15 March there will be an official start to the anniversary year, and as Geisingen currently has no hall, this opening event takes place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in Kirchen-Hausen.
As part of the anniversary, several events are planned in Geisingen, as well as in church houses.
Church houses will be held in July on a festive weekend from 18th to 20th July the 1250th.
Celebrate the return.
On Friday with a festive act, on Saturday and Sunday with a party around the Kirchtalhalle.
On this festive weekend is also the church-house church festival.
City Music Director Rudolf Barth has written an order composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which will be performed on three dates.
On 21 June together with the Sonnwend celebration of the Black Forest Association, on 12 July in the arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of city music in the new Festhalle.
This will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date is on the last weekend of September, 27 and 28 September.
A new chronicle will also be released on the occasion of the Geisinger City Jubilee.
"It should be a chronicle not only of Geisingen itself, but a printed work about the geising of today, which consists of Geisingen, Kirchen-Hausen, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," said Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And today’s geising also celebrates its 2014 birthday, in 1974 today’s spaceship was completed with the incorporations.
The new chronicle will then be presented on 21 or 22 November at the new Festhalle in Geisingen.
2014 is also another year with many anniversaries.
On February 8th, Strohglonki will start with a evening of customs on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the Harmonie Gutmadingen will be 90 years old and will have the banquet on March 29th and then celebrate the district music festival from May 1st to 4th.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen turns 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the Polyhymnia Leipferdingen Musikverein turns 150 years old and celebrates this as part of the Fountain Festival from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a certificate of donation, which is owned by the monastery of St. Gallen, in 764.
The certificate was made in churches (houses), which at the time was a courthouse.
Both communities are therefore mentioned in the same document.
The reason to celebrate this 1250-year-old in 2014, in addition, the municipal reform is also 40 years behind.
Council takes a view of rail systems
Should the railway crossing "Am Hirschen" be converted in a complex way to increase road safety?
Yes, the local councils have decided.
Schiltach has to take in 220 000 euros for this.
Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year.
In particular, safety at rail crossings should be increased - there are regular collisions of trains with other vehicles nationwide.
If the municipalities agree to the conversion measures, they must participate with a third in the costs, the rest sharing the railway and the federal government.
Schiltach's city builder Roland Grie<0xC3><0x9F>haber explained to the municipal council the peculiarities of the "Am Hirschen" crossing.
There, the city plans to build a bulge at the level of the tunnel mouth west of the railway track.
There, too, larger vehicles, such as those transporting longwood, could be on the road without having to block the tracks.
Grie<0xC3><0x9F>haber therefore proposed to construct a required support wall so that the city could widen the subsequent road at a given time to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was controversially discussed in the municipal council, as some councils questioned the need for road distribution: Thomas Kipp, with his statement, brought to the point of the critics’ sentiment: “Do we have to take so much money into our hands because of so few vehicles?”
Mayor Thomas Haas objected: The railway crossing "Hirschen" is regularly used for long wood transports.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is partly transported over this route, because the vehicles up to 20 meters long could not use the route on the H<0xC3><0xA4>berlesbrücke, because they could not turn into the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a diversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is closed, Haas argued.
Since it is to be expected that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels would have to be rebuilt and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing "Am "Hirschen" could also have an important traffic significance for a longer period of time.
The councils agreed to investigate what costs would cause the planned widening of the road.
Nevertheless, the majority agreed to the conversion of the railway crossing with the proviso that the necessary support wall will be built in such a way that the city can expand the subsequent road towards "Bahnhofstra<0xC3><0x9F>e" if necessary for meeting traffic to around 5.5 meters.
The conversion of the railway crossing at the Gerberei Trautwein, on the other hand, could lead to a completely different problem, which concerns the access to the strongly rising "Geroltzh<0xC3><0xA4>user Weg".
The administration had examined the reconstruction plans of the railway from the engineering office Breinlinger, as it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzh<0xC3><0xA4>user Weg would then be possible without further delay.
The investigation came to the conclusion that it cannot be ruled out that the slope conditions of the road could cause longer vehicles to sit.
The responsibility for this again bears the city as a road construction load carrier.
Therefore, the conversion could lead to liability disputes.
Since both the wood removal and the bending in the current state of development worked, one should not agree to the conversion of the railway crossing, Haas argued.
At this point, too, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the transition is significantly lower than at the other rail crossings, because there is a good visual connection directly next to the stopping point center to which there is a good visual connection.
Even trains from the central station would have to be slowed down at this point to such an extent that no collision would threaten.
The majority refused to accept the conversion of this railway, as the city of Schiltach would have to "bade out" the problem of sitting vehicles, according to the councils, as the railway could withdraw from responsibility after completion of the construction work.
The committee considers it unproblematic the conversions at the railway crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach", for which crossing agreements have already been made with the railway.
Esa Decides on Large Space Missions: Missions for Billions
Remote planets, gravitational waves, or black holes – European space agency experts now have to agree on two major projects they want to launch in the next few years.
There were 30 suggestions to choose from, five are still in the race.
Far worlds.
More than 1,000 planets at other stars have already been found by astronomers.
Whether there are lives on at least some of them, no one knows.
The selection is difficult: Should you look for gravitational waves?
Or rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or travel to Earth-like planets and perhaps discover extraterrestrial life?
These questions are currently being asked by the European Space Agency (ESA).
For their program "Cosmic Vision", they are looking for ideas for two large space projects that will make the research a decisive step forward.
The budget for such "L-Missions" is approximately one billion euros each.
The launch is expected to be in 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were debated, five of which have now come to the narrower election.
Numerous committees are reviewing the proposals, scrutinizing the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision will be made by the Scientific Programme Committee.
A total of four major questions have been selected by Esa, on which the missions of the Cosmic Vision program, initiated in 2007, are to find answers.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes in the formation of stars from large gas clouds – and thus also the formation of planets that orbit these stars – are still in the proverbial darkness.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
In order to answer this question, the Space Telescope "Cheops" will launch in 2017, with which 500 already known planetary systems will be examined in more detail in our vicinity.
However, the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
Using larger instruments, astronomers could map Earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and thus search for "biomarkers": gases that are considered an indicator of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question, too, should ultimately give an idea of what conditions exist for the emergence of life.
An important role plays the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation it emits with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be investigated by way of example.
With the "Solar Orbiter", the Esa has already approved a mission of the M-Class (there the budget is about half a billion euros) for this question.
The probe is expected to start in 2017 and monitor the surface and activity of the sun closely.
Of great interest to the researchers are also Jupiter and its moons.
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system.
Esa is the first of the three L-missions of the Cosmic Vision programme.
"Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is set to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, it reaches Jupiter and is to study the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymede.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to investigate whether the natural laws known to us are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also deviations that could show physicists the way to a new theory under which all known laws of nature can be united.
How did the universe come into being and what does it consist of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the Big Bang.
In addition to our common matter, which consists of stars, planets and living things like us, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and clusters of galaxies together, and dark energy, through which the expansion of space accelerates.
So far, the researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first fractions of the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of.
With "Euclid", the Esa has already approved an M-Mission here, the launch of which is planned for 2020.
Using a special telescope, the probe is intended to examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time across the entire sky, thus enabling conclusions to be drawn about the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection process.
According to many experts "E-Lisa", the best chance of obtaining an L-mission permit, has a sophisticated concept for detecting gravitational waves.
Physicists understand changes in the structure of spacetime that Albert Einstein predicted nearly 100 years ago.
They have not been proven to this day.
Elisa could do that, the scientists hope behind the project.
The mission provides a detector consisting of two or three probes, which is stationed in space.
Unlike plants on Earth, it could also detect gravitational waves that formed during the Big Bang, thus providing new insights into the formation of the cosmos.
Four more proposals compete for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which is to explore black holes among others, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which is to detect and investigate Earth-like planets.
There have already been proposals for sample reconnaissance from Mars, for exploration of the moon, Venus and asteroids, as well as for solar physics.
Snowden ready to “cooperate” with Germany on US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the U.S. intelligence agency, has stated that he is willing to travel to Berlin and testify before the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not give any answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where this asylum has been granted to discuss the statement with him in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbele, he writes: “Even though the outcome of my efforts was demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a breach of loyalty and tries to criminalize political expression with a threat of punishment, in which no defense is possible.”
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the American government to drop the charges against him.
The indictment filed by the U.S. Department of Justice includes espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is willing to talk to German representatives, we will find ways to make that happen.”
The relationship between the US and Germany is strained by the claims that the NSA had intercepted Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cell phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for intelligence, said it should take the opportunity to hear Snowden as a witness, if possible, “without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States.”
Ströbele, a Green MP, posted a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele explained that, according to former NSA employee Snowden’s lawyer, he could not return to Russia if he left the country.
When Snowden says in Germany, he needs an assurance that he is “safe” there, according to the MP.
Snowden explained in his letter that he saw himself face to face with a “serious and ongoing” persecution campaign that drove him out of his home country.
However, he was touched by the global response to “my act of political expression.”
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking politicians – including in the United States – have described the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a public service.
In his letter, Snowden makes an offer of cooperation to the German authorities “when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved”.
Frontier Airlines raises fees for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for passengers who wish to store hand luggage on their flights.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for a piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even if it was read in the announcement on Wednesday that passengers should keep the whole box.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat remain free of charge.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if the fee was paid in advance, and $100 for travelers who only paid at the airport.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee aims to move travelers to take care of the payment in advance.
“We don’t want to calculate that amount,” she said.
Airlines began charging fees for the first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers who tried to avoid these have therefore put as much as possible into hand luggage, which means that the luggage compartments above the seat are often overcrowded.
Fees are a way to get passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee isn't really about making money.
It is about the most loyal customers of Frontier, who would have clearly expressed that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline’s website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may be allowed to take a piece of luggage with them for free, but the next person may have to pay $100 for a similar piece of luggage.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's website and check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers would be informed of the fee before they arrived at the airport.
Frontier’s new carry-on fee will only come into effect in the summer, there is no exact date yet.
Passengers often complain about luggage surcharges and other charges, but airlines like to resort to them.
They argue that the transportation of luggage costs money and passengers should pay for this service if they wish.
Many on Wall Street consider the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, most leave the fingers of fees for hand luggage so far.
Spirit Airlines Inc. was the first to charge for hand luggage three years ago and then Allegiant Air, also a low-cost airliner.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who carefully follows the additional fees.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the hand luggage charge Spirit spends $50 million annually.
Sorensen, who previously held a leadership position with Midwest Airlines, has recently flown with Spirit and was curious about what he would expect at the airport if passengers were faced with the company’s unusual carry-on fee.
“The boarding process was one of the smoothest I’ve experienced in my aviation career,” he said.
I was expecting to see teeth grinding and hands-on discussions on the flight path.
“The plane was full,” he explained, “and the boarding was running as lubricated.”
Frontier also follows Spirit on the $2 required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company stated that passengers who bought lemonade or juice should keep the whole can and coffee will be refilled for free.
Water is still free.
US Airways had briefly tried to demand money for soft drinks in 2008, but reversed this seven months later after passengers complained and no other large company had moved in.
Frontier’s move to charge for carry-on baggage when passengers don’t buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative aimed at redirecting customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz $10 to $25 per ticket sold.
This provides all companies with an incentive to move passengers for direct purchase with them rather than via an online travel agency.
Frontier has gone the farthest in this area.
In September, the company began to award only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were cut once again to 25 percent of the route.
A flight booked with a third party with Frontier over 1000 miles brings customers only 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve seats exclusively for direct purchases on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base based in Denver, but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
Revenue declined by 9 percent and flight capacity decreased by just under 13 percent in the first quarter, as reported in the financial report published Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc..
Republic has tried to get control of Frontier’s finances as part of the sale of the company.
Words come from the Bible
More than 40 women visited the last women’s breakfast this year in the evangelical church community of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the church house was "Proverbs from the Bible" and "Mediocre readings from the Middle Ages".
Zita Köhler, the chairman of the church council, addressed the Bible proverbs after breakfast in a lecture.
“Speech words contain wisdom, rules, or warnings,” she said.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding Bible passages and explained the meaning.
She called sayings such as, "The eye of wood is watchful, as scales fall from the eyes, to cast an eye upon someone, to whom the Lord gives it in his sleep, to wash his hands in innocence."
Several times the speaker also advised her listeners what the saying was.
The medieval sayings were accepted by the church council of Christel Dehner: All good things are three, making blue, and provoking something.
She explained the meaning and origin of the expressions she called "bridges into the past".
In the end, a Tombola was released.
The prizes were covered on a table and were humorously described before being handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors to the breakfast round were also mayor candidate Roman Waizenegger.
Learning instead of unemployed: Pilot project for unlearned people in tourism
Today, a pilot project for the tourism industry starts on the Mecklenburg Lake District.
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency, 49 women and men who already work as unskilled in the industry will be qualified to become specialists for hotels and restaurants over the course of three winters.
"New to this is that the six-month courses end with degrees," said Carmen Wiechert of the employment agency Neubrandenburg.
The benefits are varied: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would acquire trained professionals who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The project also includes the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
The NSA declares that an “internal error” and not hackers are to blame for the website’s crash
The shadowy National Security Agency said late Friday that an error had paralyzed their public website for a few hours and not hackers, as claimed online.
“NSA.gov was unavailable for a few hours tonight because an internal error occurred during a planned update,” the spy agency explained in a message sent by email.
The problem will be fixed this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) is not true.
In the early evenings, online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was not accessible for at least six hours and this is still not available for some users.
Earlier, a NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency’s sensitive internal network was “in no way compromised.”
Secret information is not in danger, the spokesman said.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralyzed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
Cybertactics are relatively simple and attacks do not serve to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The formerly super-secret NSA, whose nickname was once No Such Agency (No such agency), is now in the bright light of the public eye and looks after the revelations that have become known in recent months about its extensive surveillance program at home and abroad subjected to sharp criticism – a result of the secret NSA data published by disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden and stolen.
The growing controversy surrounding the intelligence service fueled initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyper operation.
The number of people without a job fell slightly in October by 22 to 1,307.
Although the quota was 3.1 percent better than last year and also better than in September, “we would have hoped for more,” says Monika Felder-Bauer, deputy head of the agency for work in Sonthofen.
Many companies have so far responded to attitudes.
One reason for this is according to Felder-Bauer: "We have hardly any skilled workers in the trades, in health care and in the care of the elderly".
As a result of the seasons, job offers for staff in the hotel and restaurant industry have also been opened again since September.
The winter season begins in mid-December.

Profit losses on Bombardier after decline in delivery figures and orders
Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday after falling orders and deliveries for aircraft in the third quarter as well as contract problems in the railway sector.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not publish flight test data for its all-new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information on whether the aircraft could go into commercial use according to the ambitious schedule next September.
The maiden flight of the test aircraft one and a half months ago followed only three further launches so far, which makes it questionable whether the test phase runs as planned.
The results remained behind the forecasts and led to a fall of over eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his rating of “outperform” to “sector perform” on Thursday in view of the fact that the stock has a limited price potential in the next one to two quarters.
“We were expecting weaker aircraft deliveries to the greatest extent possible, but we are clearly disappointed by the margin development in the transport sector,” Doerksen said in a customer letter.
We believe Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the aircraft test program progresses.
However, if new orders are not announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft line will be able to catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.
But until now, binding orders for the CSeries have been moderate at 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see if the company’s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new jet aircraft are true.
Currently, there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 binding orders at the start of commercial use of the jet.
The company management also assured analysts and the media that the program was on schedule on Thursday.
“The test aircraft has not stayed on the ground longer than expected,” Beaudoin said at a conference call, adding that during the aircraft’s service life, ground tests and software updates had been scheduled.
Every manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to take a first flight and then add a revision period, whatever we did.
This happens throughout the entire flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to launch in the next few weeks, the rest shortly after, the company said.
Nevertheless, analysts remain skeptical whether twelve months after the maiden flight, the first customer can commission an aircraft of the CSeries.
Bombardier said it is reviewing the commissioning plan (EIS) and will update it in the coming months.
“The slow progress of the flight test – even if it obviously corresponds to bombers’ internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning is shifting to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter, with the end of September 30, Bombardier’s net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, of $172 million, or 9 cents per share, the previous year.
The adjusted profit per share is 9 cents unchanged.
Sales declined slightly and fell from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer says it delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a drop of 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order backlog in the aerospace industry amounted to $32.9 billion on September 30, and remained unchanged as of December 31.
“In the field of aerospace, the results were within our specifications, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing,” Beaudoin said.
Sales in the aerospace industry fell by 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest railway manufacturer, announced that revenue in this segment has risen by almost 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The order backlog in the transport sector amounted to $32.6 billion on September 30, and was thus slightly increased compared to December 31.
The profit margin in the area of transport was affected by settlement problems in some major contracts.
According to management, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trade on Thursday, the Bombardier stock dropped by 8.5 percent and stood at 4.83 Canadian dollars, after it was also announced that Google’s finance chief Patrick Pikhette will switch to the board.
Brazil’s Embraer SA, the world’s third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bombarder’s closest rival, reported a 10 percent drop in quarterly earnings on Thursday.
USA: Shooting at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown man fired shots at LAX airport on Friday morning (local time).
While the airport management told Twitter that the gunman was in custody, the Los Angeles Times reported that the man was dead.
A security guard was also killed.
The media also reported several injuries.
US President Barack Obama will be constantly informed about the situation, White House spokesman Jay Carney said.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3 eyewitnesses reported seeing a gunman with a gun in one of the departure halls, as several media reported.
A traveler told CNN that many people had been looking for protection in panic.
Travelers would have cried and children would cry.
Among the waiters panic broke out, many had hidden behind chairs for fear.
He has heard two shots, says a traveler from the Los Angeles Times.
An employee of the security agency TSA has suffered a gunshot wound to the foot.
The scene was “like in a movie.”
After that, he himself was taken to a security area, the man reported.
The shots are said to have fallen near a security control area.
Airport building evacuated
On television pictures, you can see how many ambulances and police cars were driving in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were taken out of the building to safety.
Users posted photos of a special operations command and a gun lying on the ground.
According to the airport management via Twitter, the incident began at 9.30 a.m. (local time).
The access roads were blocked, which, according to CNN, resulted in a long setback.
Until landings, air traffic had been temporarily suspended, it was said.
However, several aircraft were also seen on CNN at the start.
Terminal 3 is primarily served by smaller U.S. airlines.
Los Angeles LAX Airport is one of the largest airports in the United States.
Cocaine-dependent lawyer warning drug boss of police investigation must go to jail
Basharat Ditta, 42, shared information on underworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction might come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court
A well-known criminal, who warned a drug baron of a major police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug addiction could be exposed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations into his drug trafficking activities after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, nicknamed "Bash" by criminals, was arrested in his home in 2011 after police monitored Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous drug trial.
Officials watched Scarborough deliver three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a dinner of the bar.
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly consumed Class A drugs after traces of cocaine were found in his hair, wallet, and credit cards during tests.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain unauthorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were monitored by police during a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were later arrested after police secured <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine and <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash in a series of home searches.
Ditta, 42, passed on information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction could become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for the law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found and convicted at Liverpool Crown Court in two counts of obstruction of justice after a three-week trial.
He admitted possession of cocaine during a previous survey.
The lawyer was arrested after police found out in their investigation against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta’s house and put the drugs under the lawyer’s trash bin with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove.
Shortly after delivering the drugs, Scarborough regularly telephoned with Ditta, who was at dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, got the drugs and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
In court, it was revealed that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of cocaine after class A drugs were discovered in his hair, wallet, and credit cards during tests.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied taking cocaine and said he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client, claiming that their discussion was subject to the “lawyer’s secret.”
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was taken from him.
At the police interrogation, he stated that he was operating an office under his private address as well as in the workplace and that clients would call him at home for legal matters.
In court, it was announced that he had called key players in the drug trade, some of whom he had previously represented, for significant arrests and informed about what the investigators knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said, “A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that you don’t break the law.”
Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a criminal defender, as he has been too involved with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not just that of a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies drugs to his lawyer.
Part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the lawyer of these people.
But that went far beyond the boundaries of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He acted against the police investigation as far as possible so that they could continue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta thus discredited his profession.
He was too close to certain clients, particularly Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta dismissed any wrongdoing, claiming, “If I were a corrupt lawyer who I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, I wouldn’t wait 15 hours, but I would do it immediately.”
However, after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police Department said: “Mr. Ditta has taken the step from a criminal defender to a criminal the moment he started buying drugs from organized criminals.”
His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organized crime who commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public trust and confidence.
Ditta has lost this confidence and is trying to hide behind the facade of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases for possession of cocaine and obstruction of justice, which underscores our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We will find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to the conspiracy to trade heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other people involved in the drug trade were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself stating that his dream job was to represent clients in the death cell in America, his ultimate guest at dinner being Mohammed Ali, and inequality of opportunity was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary work of church music
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of his 160th anniversary, the Dunningen Liederkranz is framed by two services with the "German Fair" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which delighted the audience in the spring of this year, at the end of the anniversary year, the song wreath will enrich two services with the performance of Franz Schubert's Deutsche Messe.
On Saturday, 26 October, this extraordinary Mass will be held from 19 during the evening Mass in St. Martin’s Church Dunning and on Sunday, 27 October, from 10:15 am at the church service in St. John’s Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title "Songs for the Celebration of the Holy Victim of the Mass", D 872, is a spiritual music work by the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of its creation.
The exhibition will be presented as part of the services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the brass group of the Musikverein Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Haslach: Skepticism is becoming more and more confident
With the elections to the parish council in 2015, for example, the pastoral unit Haslach (SE) will change fundamentally.
There is only one parish council for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday, the bodies from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
There is nothing to be changed about the diocese’s fundamental decisions and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
In the course of the day it became particularly clear: the skepticism towards the new is reluctantly but increasingly a confidence.
From the conceptions and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council, the highly constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main officials of the pastoral team reached.
On the basis of a presentation, Regionaldean Georg Schmitt explained the newly established guidelines for pastoral care units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg.
After that, SE Haslach as a church community will form a public law body that will enter into the rights and duties of the six individual churches.
There will only be a joint parish council and a foundation council in which the parish council is represented.
At least two elected members are to be represented from each parish, and so-called community teams are formed in the six parishes.
Your task will be to promote church life in the place in the future.
When asked about the finances of the individual parish, there was then considerable need for discussion.
The innovations provide that accumulated funds in the parishes are retained for purpose.
On the other hand, the liabilities are transferred to the whole community.
Especially with regard to the large planned investments, the obligation of which then meets all parishes, there were great concerns.
"Even in the past, only projects that could be managed by the individual parishes alone have been invested," relativized Haslach's parish council chairman Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a joint body for five parishes was described by Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the body in the pastoral unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
They had set themselves the task of "getting one, staying five" in 2006 and had to find that this is not so easy at all.
The committees of the Haslacher Seelsorgeunit then set out to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish council and the practical work of the community teams.
The draftings will be made concrete in further meetings and decided in a further joint meeting of all six bodies in the coming spring.
In the end, parish council Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the pastoral unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf, electricity becomes more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorf must adjust to higher electricity costs.
As the Managing Director of the Stadtwerke, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed to the S<0xC3><0x9C>DKURIER, a four-person Pfullendorf family will be charged 70 to 90 euros in additional costs per year.
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEG conversion from 5,277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This surcharge is re-established every October by the four operators of the major power lines.
These figure out the additional costs they will be incurred from the energy transition, which they can charge through a surcharge over the electricity price.
The municipal works Pfullendorf form the last link in this chain.
The company’s supervisory board had even assumed a higher turnover in its forecasts, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now the concrete figures would have to be calculated before the Stadtwerke could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We expect a rise of 1 cent plus x," Bias said, with the number more likely to be close to the 2 cents.
Traffic light on permanent red: Pay attention to waiting time
Sometimes a light just doesn’t turn green.
The contact loop in the road does not respond, or the light sign is defective.
What to do - drive in red?
If an affected person has waited long enough for a red light and the crossing is free, he can continue, explains Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting time must be "appropriate", which can be interpreted differently on a case-by-case basis.
Becker advises to hold out for at least five minutes before starting from a malfunction of the traffic light.
However, those who continue the journey despite red light must be aware that they are fully indebted to an accident caused by it.
Those who wait less than five minutes may not wait long enough, Becker warns and refers to a decision of the Oberlandesgericht Hamm.
In the negotiated case, a driver had ignored the traffic lights after about three minutes of continuous red and had to be responsible for a negligent red light violation.
The traffic light was not defective, but jumped on green a little later.
He was spared a driving ban because of the special situation - but not the fine.
City Council welcomes solid budget
Whenever it comes to the budget at community council meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The municipal bag in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and debt has not been known to the administration since 2005.
In this sense, the 2012 financial year can also be booked as a complete success.
This was evident in the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget at around 7.6 million euros over one million euros was higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget is also around one million euros above the approach with about 1.8 million euros.
The surplus is mainly due to higher business tax revenues and the municipal share in income tax.
The wealth balance was also clearly above the planned values.
Instead of the planned 1.5 million euros, it was 2.5 million euros last year.
"This is essentially due to the higher supply from the administrative budget," Rothmund said.
Since less investment has been made in the financial year 2012 than planned, the supply of reserves has also been higher.
Overall, the general backlog was increased by around 2.1 million euros to a total of 4.9 million euros now.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"You don't just shake such a work out of your sleeve," Gerster praised with regard to the annual accounts.
He and the local councils were visibly pleased with the good numbers.
It may sound paradoxical, but these very good numbers could soon cost citizens a lot.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality has been able to dispense with high rates in the past.
However, according to Gerster, subsidies have often been cut by the country.
There are prerequisites for these grants from various compensatory stocks.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities that apply for grants must have certain rates.
"We need to look at the issue of leverage, as investments are coming up for which we would like to have grants," Gerster said in a statement.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter in the choir for 60 years
At the age of 60 as a singer, Hubert Wermter’s history at the men’s singing club C<0xC3><0xA4>cilia is almost twice as long as that of the autumn festival, in which he was solemnly honored.
Hubert Wermter was on stage as usual in the colours of his male singing club.
Even after 60 years, singing with the now more than loved choir still makes him great fun.
Wermter was also active in the association, including 28 years as a member of the committee.
He received several awards for his commitment and loyalty to the association: Jörg Kohr, pastoral representative on behalf of the C<0xC3><0xA4>cilian Association Rottenburg-Stuttgart, presented him - since the choir is also a church choir - a certificate of association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His singing colleagues handed him the certificate of the German Choir Association as well as an engraved tin plate.
In addition to the honour, the 31st autumn festival took place in familiar tracks: with the MGV Betra, the Liederkranz Salzstetten, the singing department of Baisingen and the local music club, the full-maringers had loaded a colorful mix of different choirs and singing styles, which entertained the around 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as "Im Weinparadies" and "Lustig, her brothers".
In honor of their honorary singer Hubert Wermter, they prepared a small stand - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The men's singing club Betra also sang classical choral songs such as "J<0xC3><0xA4>gerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Wit, far away" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "When you pass through the valley".
With his mixed choir and his women's group - the "impulse choir" - the song wreath Salzstetten ensured the women's quota of the festival.
With the Neapolitan folk style "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus, the mixed choir kidnapped foreign countries, while the "Impulsschor" also resorted to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singing department of the Baisinger Sportverein came with "What is the Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied" back to home territory, where the Vollmmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical degree.
For the children there was a small side program - "Oma Hanne" aka Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a Kasperltheater and read a few stories that the children did well at lunchtime.
Children's dreams come true
The kindergartens and daycare centres in the Zollernalbkreis receive mail these days.
In cooperation with Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, the Schwarzw<0xC3><0xA4>lder Bote wants to support the facilities in the realization of their building and beautification wishes.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
All kindergartens, day care centres and nurserys from the entire Zollernalbkreis can participate in the action.
If you have a building or beautification request for your facility, you can apply with this one at the Black Forest messenger.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the Action Kindergarten construction site.
A jury, consisting of representatives of Schwarzw<0xC3><0xA4>lder Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, selects three wishes from all submissions.
What are the prerequisites for participation?
The wish should be realized with construction material worth a maximum of 2000 euros and on a (action) day.
In addition, the winner himself must take care of many hard-working builders.
What about the day of action and the helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of Sparkasse Zollernalb.
It will be delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, clubs and of course the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan press outraged over controversial media law
“We are in a frightening situation and one may ask oneself: what prevents Parliament from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?” read the paper, which considers the bill unconstitutional.
“The law is draconian and very punitive and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of Capital Group, which also includes CapitalFM, one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal “will always be biased because it is an extended arm of the government,” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya’s position in the global economy.
“I hope the President will listen to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament,” he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government takes “the media effectively into a squabble” by the new law, while The Standard, Democracy and Freedom of Speech in Kenya, writes that “had suffered a severe blow” and called the draft “draconic”.
The passing of the law is one of a number of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping centre in September.
The Kenyan media attracted the anger of the authorities because they released footage of security cameras showing the units sent to the crime scene allegedly robbed the luxury shopping mall.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by ordering two journalists and a leading media representative to interrogate, even if the subpoena was withdrawn after the media shouted.
According to the new law, media houses can be occupied with a penalty of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to one million as well as the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “even a single penalty can push most radio stations into bankruptcy.”
In addition, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya’s description of “lively blogosphere.”
If they silence the media, politicians can do whatever they want without punishment.
“No one will ever know,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist with the nation who calls the Kenyan media a key control factor in public life.
“If you leave politicians themselves, they lead the country into bankruptcy and us back to the time of hunters and gatherers,” he said.
In the past, Kenyan lawmakers have already taken on public trouble.
In May, they voted to reverse the cuts ordered by the National Remuneration Commission and reinstate their strong salaries of about 532,000 shillings tax-free per month – they are among the highest in the world.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream comes true for FC
Due to the importance for the city and the football club, the official inaugural celebration for the artificial turf sports ground did not lose anything despite the cold weather and rain.
A more pleasant ceremony had probably been desired by everyone last Saturday, but Peter did not want to play along.
So all those had the oversight that came without an umbrella or could not hold one for any reason.
This was the case with the musicians who framed the ceremony, as did some speakers.
Nass therefore also became FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
First of all, he thanked Mayor Walter Klumpp, who was strongly committed to the implementation of the project, the municipal council, the companies involved and the members of the association who took part.
Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The rustic retirees moved 400 square meters of paving stones for the new paths.
This remarkable honorary commitment also paid tribute to the MP Karl Rombach.
Further greetings were given to the municipal sports committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South Baden Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation for the club’s youth department.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that recurring weather-related influences in the spring and autumn added to the original lawn so that it could not be played.
Already 15 years ago there were the first considerations for solving the problem, when the idea was to build a third place at the grounds of the football club or at the real school on Lake Saline.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, thoughts emerged about the construction of an artificial turf sports ground, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Concrete plans were taken up two years ago when the FC took over the Schabelstube in Erbpacht, promised a cost participation of 100 000 euros for the construction of the square and the country approved funding of 104,000 euros.
The municipal council decided in October 2012 to take over the remaining €356,000 in total costs of €560,000, Klumpp summarized.
The construction of the 68-by-108-metre artificial turf site began on June 4.
During the construction phase lasting over three months, 3000 cubic metres of earth were removed, half of which was used for the installation of a dirt bike track.
The Union and the SPD continued their coalition negotiations on internal and judicial issues.
In addition, the competent working group met in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, it is about direct democracy, parliamentary bribery and the Federal Police.
In the morning, the Working Group on Migration and Integration also wanted to continue its consultations.
Among other things, it should be about dual citizenship, in which both sides have opposing views.
The SPD wants to end the coercion for German-born immigrant children to opt for one - the Union rejects a double passport.
On the subject of transport, which is not on the agenda for the meeting this Friday, the SPD underlined its “no” to a car toll required by the CSU.
A vignette is a "flat rate for multi-driving and thus ecologically counterproductive," said the SPD negotiator for the topic of transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
There was a threat of traffic jams on rural roads, which are already major accidents.
The introduction of a toll for all cars would also be a first step from Pronold’s point of view.
“There is a risk that compensation for Germans will be removed at a later date,” he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing hair wave on the open-air stage

Drivers seriously injured in accident
In an accident on Thursday evening, a 37-year-old car driver from Aachen was seriously injured.
According to police, a 41-year-old from Müsch was traveling towards Grefrath with her car on the Kempener Outer Ring at around 21.15.
When she wanted to turn left onto St. Töniser Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e, she oversaw the 37-year-old’s oncoming car.
The drive saw collided.
The Aachener suffered serious injuries and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment.
Constancy: Blockage after accident at the Sch<0xC3><0xA4>nzlekreisel
The accident occurred, according to police, when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza drove out of town on the left lane of the two-lane Reichenaustra<0xC3><0x9F>e on Thursday evening, around 8 p.m.
Shortly before the roundabout at Sch<0xC3><0xA4>nzle, he noticed that he was on the left-hand lane towards Stromeyersdorfstra<0xC3><0x9F>e and switched to the right lane.
This brought about a collision with the BMW of a 23-year-old Konstanzer.
Also damaged was the VW Passat of a 19-year-old driving behind the BMW.
A total of around 15,000 property damage occurred, the police said.
The roadway had to be blocked during the accident, it continued.
Vienna Airport cancels passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
There will be no more announcements like this at Vienna-Schwechat Airport in the future.
A large part of the loudspeaker penetrations are thus lost - the noise level should be lowered so significantly.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As Airport spokesman Peter Kleemann told Radio Wien, the Vienna Airport follows an international trend with the cessation of announcements that affect individuals.
Among other things, airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai are already giving up the noisy calls.
The omission of these announcements – on average, around 200 personal calls through the loudspeakers in one day – is intended to make things quieter at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in the experience that these individual statements have been perceived relatively little, but at the same time all other information about changed flight departures or departure times is going down a bit here," Kleemann said in a conversation with the radio station.
Highlander games on the Kaltenhof
In addition to the tractors, there is a second competition at the agricultural autumn festival at the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7, the Highlander Games will start at 1.30 p.m.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they are Swabian in the Kaltenhof.
Teams and individual fighters compete in the disciplines of tree trunk throwing, horseshoe throwing and water buckets.
The tree trunk is four and a half meters long and weighs 25 to 30 kilograms.
"It doesn't matter at all," explains organizer Peter Saile.
The trunk has to be thrown off vertically, is supposed to overlap once and then just come to lie down.
This is assessed with most points.
When throwing horses, it depends on the target accuracy.
Eight meters away is thrown on a plock.
Skill and strength must be demonstrated by the participants in carrying water more than 50 meters.
Time and amount of water in a bottle are measured at the end.
From each "Clan" or team, two are then allowed to participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition will receive prizes.
You can train from 10 a.m.
A suitable dress is desired, for example, the competitors can compete in the Scots Rock.
Swabian dress is also allowed.
For the "outfit" the jury still gives a few bonus points.
You can register up to one hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish Swabian Highlander games and the tractor-pulling, which begins half an hour earlier, there is a lot of action on the festival grounds on Saturday.
In the evening, the wind music lovers will come at their expense.
At 7 p.m., the Biraböhmische Blasmusik from Schömberg will host the big evening of entertainment.
The chapel plays beautiful polkas and marches.
Their repertoire also includes emotional waltzes and a rich big-band sound.
The Heinz Koch, known as the singing host and black sausage baron, will be among the gutters for a while.
In Dornhan he has already appeared at the Christmas market and at the Fools' guild.
On Sunday, the Leinstetten Music Association will be hosting an early shopping session, from 2 pm the Bauernkapelle Böffingen will be a guest, and the "Oldies" will end the party.
The Stoppelackerparty with DJ Ralf is already opening on Friday.
On Saturday and Sunday, other program points include the classic car and tractor meeting, exhibitions of companies on the topic of agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sundays include the corn maze, the artisan market and sheep shearing.
Especially for children there is a petting zoo, straw hill castle, tractor driving (under guidance) and tractor surfing.
The organizers are the multi-purpose hall of the Förderverein, the ski club and the tractor friends "Zündk<0xC3><0xA4>psele".
Milk and egg alternatives at a glance
Vegan diets require plant-based alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Purified tofu with plant cream is, for example, a quark set.
The Vegetarian Federation will also be calling the World Vegan Day on November 1st.
On the occasion of the World Vegan Day on November 1st, the German Vegetarian Federation proposes a number of vegan alternatives:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, let yogurt replace with soy yogurt.
Instead of milk, soy, oat, almond or rice milk can be used.
Remarkable plant cream replaces conventional whipped cream.
There are also plant alternatives to eggs.
For example, half a crushed, ripe banana can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
50 grams of apple or a tablespoon of ground flax seeds plus three tablespoons of water are also suitable for this.
Instead of using egg, for example, the dough is loosened with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder, a tablespoon of food strength and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But even 50 grams of soy yoghurt or silken ofu can fulfill this purpose.
According to Vebu, about 800,000 people in Germany are currently eating vegan, i.e. purely plant-based.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, students from Black Forest High School met the American city of New York.
After eight hours of flight, it immediately started to the Brooklyn Bridge, over which the heart of the city, Manhattan, was reached on foot.
Here was already a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which is a special attraction in the evening light.
Due to the time shift, the students were almost 24 hours on their feet, but true to the motto "The city doesn't sleep" the day was decided at Times Square.
Despite Shutdown, on the second day, the Statue of Liberty could be reached by ferry and climbed on foot.
Then the financial center around Wall Street was moved to the 11th of September memorial.
On the third day, students from the Empire State Building’s 373-metre-high viewing platform were able to gain an overview of the fascinatingly large city while enjoying the view.
After that, the bustle of the streets of New York passed through the Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity for a short stay in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived in their host families and experience everyday school life at Weymouth High School.
Also this year, on the name day of St. Hubertus in the parish church of St. Marien on Hülsbergstra<0xC3><0x9F>e, a Hubertus mass is celebrated.
St. Hubertus was the legend of a rather ruthless hunter who was converted by a vision and later appointed Bishop of Li<0xC3><0xA8>ge.
The hunting horn blower group of the Jagdreiter Westphalia under the direction of Brigitte Kluth is playing on parforce horns (natural horns in the mood It) according to old, originally French melodies.
The windblowers wear riding clothes because they mainly accompany riders, horses and dogmen on tow hunts musically.
The festive fair will take place on Sunday, 3 November, at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed store shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to linger and come back.
One that wants to make the name of the program.
According to Lexikon, Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu is a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself in the sense of having experienced or seen a new situation before.
In the case of a visit to the café of the same name at the stop in the district town of Kleve in sight to the Rhein-Waal University of Applied Sciences, it does not have to remain in the pure Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu feeling.
After all, the café with the beautiful name has exactly that goal: to make an actual stay not only mental, but tangible, always repeatable.
Because it's fun and just beautiful.
A glance into the interior of the stop 8 gives the viewer a good feeling as soon as possible.
The state-of-the-art but not cool café ambience looks like a place to feel good.
Here, the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top spoils the guest with a variety of coffee or cocktail varieties.
In addition, there are delicious cakes or individually coated fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already made a name for themselves before the opening of the beautiful café at the stop as a gastronomer: in Kranenburg they led the "Art Lounge".
From moving to Kleve at the store, the pleasant café lovers are hoping for more audience.
And last but not least, the university.
“We do not have a specific target group,” emphasizes Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two young students here would like to address just as much as the seniors and all the age classes in between.
Speaking of coffee lovers.
The friendly owner couple is behind the coffee enjoyment.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in a wide variety of variations.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is the expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the cappuccino drinker.
"That's a baguette - that's my thing," she tells the NRZ.
There were also two events in the bright café.
Better said one.
Because the harbour festival took place outside - the Café Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the Ringelnatz evening.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds found.
But not everyone's thing.
Perhaps that’s why Daniel Büttner isn’t a huge fan of event evenings: “You can’t do it all right.”
And with an event, I always address only those who are interested in the special event.
That’s why events will be the exception for us.
"We want to disrupt normal operation as little as possible".
Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu also stands for reliability.
In terms of the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the store in Kleve.
The street, which is becoming more and more a gastronomic mile.
To the delight of many Klever, the guests from near and far and the students who discover the gastronomy and thus also the Café Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu for themselves.

A day of thank you at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th Stiftungsfest to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, had gladly come.
In the club room of the restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker everyone enjoyed the harmonious cooperation in the name of music.
Traditionally, the Foundation Festival is always the right festival for honors.
The special award "Singer of the Year" was welcomed this time by the writer Rolf Wagener.
"Not only have you written a lot for us, but you have also done so many rounds for us, for our heartfelt thank you," said the chairman of the choir Erich Schlotmann.
This year, the awards for participation in the performances and choir samples by means of activity speeches went to the choir director Dieter Schulze with 44 participations, followed by the honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and last year's "singer of the year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participations each.
5th place is listed as Artur Brückner.
A special thank you was given to the team of Vereinswirtin Ange Pier-Ribbert, who had once again conjured up a menu of the top class and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets with his regular choir samples every Tuesday at 7.45 p.m. in the club room.
"New songs are always welcome," Schlotmann said.
UN Announces New Goals for Combating Poverty
The United Nations is now starting to develop a set of new targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals for poverty reduction announced twelve years ago.
In the run-up to the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing “sustainable development goals” to replace the 2015 Millennium Development Goals.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world political leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit that the time had come to “think beyond national interests.”
“I am pleased that the member states have agreed to embark on a process to reach universal, sustainable development goals,” he said.
“These goals will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will not be afraid to implement this mandate given to me by the member states in order to realize our vision of the sustainable development goals based on the success of the Millennium Development Goals."
Even though the SG Achim/Baden has been without a win for four days, there is still a good mood for the handball overligist.
Coach Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about this at all.
Everyone is still fully motivated in the matter.
But I hope we finally win again.
"Because I don't know how such a victory tastes," Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the third league reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet torn out any trees, Malmon raises his index finger in advance.
I have trained a lot of players in the A-Juvenile.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
"It is also important to wait to see if there is any reinforcement from the first," explains the SG-Coach.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must definitely increase compared to the previous performances.
Above all else in the cover work and in the changeover game it happened enormously last time.
Chances must also be improved.
Therefore, I hope that my players finally got their heads free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the state founder and first president of Mozambique, to vote for peace calls during a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace again, we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, Managing Director of an investment company.
Fearing the future of the country, she exchanged her business clothes for a T-shirt with the inscription “We demand security” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday at the Independence Square of the capital.
For almost two weeks now, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst fighting since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially supported by White-ruled Rhodesia and later South Africa’s apartheid government in an effort to destabilize the country’s independent government.
After the peace treaty of 1992, she became an opposition party.
Analysts consider it unlikely that the country will fall back into a full-blown conflict, but recent events have troubled foreign investors and locals.
A lot is at stake for the fast-growing economy, as the discovery of huge offshore gas deposits and coal storage facilities in the northwest could bring investment of over $50 billion in the coming years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the US into the country.
The ruling Frelimo party, since 1975 the dominant force, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government has provoked recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of Renamos, on October 17.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Reno bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, Renamo's spokesman told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability.
Speaking to AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama considers himself a “loser” who “will use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government.”
Both Frelimo and Renamo emphasize that they want to avoid war.
However, concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo abandoned the 1992 peace agreement.
Against the FT, he stated that he meant that Frelimo no longer respects the agreement.
“Our vision is to resume negotiations, seriously,” Mazanga said.
Past talks between the parties have contributed little to resolving the tensions fueled by a series of clashes this year.
“We have two adult men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who bump their heads,” said Joseph Hanlon, an Open University lecturer and Mozambique expert.
None of them are good at negotiating and none are willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is pushing for electoral reforms, has already stated that she will boycott the local elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by an abusive movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamo’s electoral success has been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, the Movimento Democr<0xC3><0xA1>tico de Mozambique (MDM), founded by a former Renamo member, is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation comes when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country’s democracy.
“He doesn’t want multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to give up the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but she has made trouble-making attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south connection.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, which lies a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, where Beira, the port, mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale used to export coal.
In June, Rio interrupted the use of the railroad for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the line.
Mazanga responded reluctantly to the question of whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
“Renamo wanted to warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
The instability has increased the frustration over the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people were already worried about corruption, slow progress in development and a recent wave of kidnapping.
“People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems,” he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, said people just wanted stability.
“No one is interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads again,” he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends as “models of life,” says one author.
Thor’s stories showed that “brutal power has no chance against clever tricks,” and the Artus legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
However, many of the myths are “far too wild, too offensive, and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools,” which is why Crossley-Holland advocated a “careful selection” of age-appropriate works.
“I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have been proposing this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that among authors and teachers who are “excessively didactic,” children would be “completely turned off,” because in entertaining stories the messages would be “underwhelmed.”
Crossley-Holland, who has translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, stated: “You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as much as possible.”
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult writer who writes for adults and an adult writer who writes for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything has to be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be sublime, revealed by history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing rather than telling.
Hansjakob moves again in Freihof
100 years ago Heinrich Hansjakob moved to his retirement home in Haslach, on Sunday his last years were brought to life in the "Freihof".
The many spectators were thrilled by the extremely entertaining scene play.
From the arrival to the granting of honorary citizenship to his death, screenwriter and Hansjakob actor Alois Kraftzcyk had designed a fun piece that received much acclaim under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explained connections and bridged time jumps from youth to near retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob comes home to his children’s heaven, to his court.
And then began the scene play, in which Alois Krafczyk once again shined in his parade role as the great son of the city.
Stilecht performed with the two-pants and "Schwarzw<0xC3><0xA4>lder Füchsen" by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
He was not only received by the audience with much applause, but also his sister Philippine welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to put herself into the role of the sister and gave her immense life in mimics and gestures.
Between the individual playing scenes, the Mühlenbacher Bauernkapelle played suitably selected pieces of music and thus rounded off the performance.
In order to award the honorary citizenship, Haslach’s mayor Heinz Winkler then gave himself the honour, who, together with a part of the city council, made his appearance in the representation of the then official H<0xC3><0xA4>ttich.
Their anticipation then made the three-king singers, who prompted Hansjakob to shout: "Ah, how beautiful, there will be youth memories of my own three-king time again."
With their song "O Jesulein" they enjoyed the audience in the Freihof as well as the Storchentag children with their loud "Out, Out".
Hansjakob had expressed his criticism of the official church at the time, as well as his concerns about the outgrowths in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of war.
In the home ground, behind his chapel on the fire at Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A restless spirit had finally found its rest and had gone home forever," it said at the end of the scene play.
There was a lot of applause and a lot of praise from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The hope of the Neckar giants is growing
The chances of the league remaining the sport-defunct Ludwigsburg Bundesliga basketball players have increased.
Because if there is a wildcard procedure, then there is now one competitor less for the Neckar Giants.
The basketball project Hamburg Towers does not apply for a possible back seat.
“We will not participate in the Wildcard process,” said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been setting up the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic city since 2012.
However, a first breath was not heard from Ludwigsburg.
“We didn’t deal with the Wildcard process until it’s clear that Düsseldorf doesn’t get a license,” said Neckar-Riese boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper.
Until 23 May, Aufsteiger Düsseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the arbitral tribunal and prove its economic suitability for the Bundesliga.
Until now, however, the Rhinelanders were denied the license twice.
The arbitral tribunal is the last instance.
Haigerloch: Church of the Lord of the Rings
As a contribution of the city to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city’s cultural and tourism office dedicates the last of its this year’s public themed guided tours on Sunday, October 27th, to the Evening Meal Church.
After visiting the Atomic Cellar Museum, the Haigerlochs were to be considered after 1850, when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The crowning final point is a visit to the N<0xC3><0xA4>ndmahlskirche.
There, the leaders are told the story of the construction of the church and gain insights into the development of the evangelical community in a thoroughly Catholic area.
Last but not least, the church also overlooks the evening meal painting created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is an original reproduction of the famous Milan model of Leonardo da Vinci.
Meeting point for the second half-hour guided tour is at 3 p.m. at the Atomic Cellar Museum.
Tickets are available at the ticket office of the Atomic Cellar Museum.
For questions and information, the tourist office of the city of Haigerloch is available.
Snowden could also say in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum case.
Representatives of the Federal Attorney General could either ask questions in writing or personally meet the 30-year-old in Russia.
This was reported by the Interfax agency, citing unspecified circles familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be resolved intergovernmentally, it said.
An exit from Snowdens from Russia is practically excluded.
"In this case, he loses his refugee status," the agency quoted her source as saying.
Because Germany is an ally of the US, Snowden threatened extradition there, it continued
Long breath pays off
Six men's teams competed for the winner's title at the club's tennis tournament.
In the end, the endurance of Team Maier/Bronner decided on the last match.
The tennis department of Sportfreunde Rohrdorf had received a dream weather for the tournament of local clubs and friends.
The fun of tennis was at the forefront of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the schedule, with everyone playing against everyone.
Played in double mode with a long set of up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes duration.
Anja Schlichter leads the tournament
The tournament management was in the proven hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament went into the decisive phase.
The favourites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were exactly the same as Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of SG Rohrweiler), so the last two matches had to make the decision.
At the award ceremony, Carmen Müller was finally able to hand over the hiking cup to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the finish line.
The second place was the double Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmicic.
The bronze staircase reached Rainer and Bernd Maier of the Asphaltreicher team.
At late afternoon sun and coffee and cake the successful outcome of the tournament took place.
On the last weekend of August, the Schwarzw<0xC3><0xA4>lder Freilichtmuseum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is once again firmly in the hands of children.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturday and Sunday, August 24 and 25, as part of the summer holiday program to a colorful children’s and family festival with numerous participations and events.
“Big and small can learn different old crafts on both days,” the press release states.
Whether making soaps, turning candles, felting or making ropes, there is something for every age.
The children are helping regional artisans from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
In the museum workshop is also processed.
During the construction of cuckoo pipes, water wheels or circling, the young guests can prove their craftsmanship.
Lots of fun also promises the many old games, such as push cart races or stilt races.
Speed and coordination are required here.
For all small detectives, the open-air museum offers a guided tour of the museum on Saturdays and Sundays, at 12 a.m. and 2 p.m. respectively.
On an off-road tour, the children must guess which stories correspond to the truth or are still lying.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a carriage ride with Black Forest foxes.
Not only horses, but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens can be found on the site and admired.
In addition, all children can look forward to the Clown Otsch on Sunday, who will be driving his scraper with the museum guests from 11 a.m. onwards.
In the meantime, Hermann Büttner is cozy and fairytale.
The storyteller takes the little guests to the wonderful world of fairy tales at 11, 13 and 15 o’clock.
In addition, the children’s costume dance group from Gutach will perform traditional dances at 11.30 a.m.
Furthermore, on both days from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., numerous craftsmen such as the broom binder, the seamstress, the spinner, the weaver and the baker can look over her shoulder in her traditional work.
Until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors to the open-air museum can expect a varied holiday program.
In a small New Zealand town, Burt Muro is regarded as a lovable chew because he decided to take part in a race in America with his motorcycle, built in 1920.
Burt, despite a heart defect, is not to be taken away from his dream.
With his savings, a few donations and a mortgage on his old workshop sheds, he transfers to Los Angeles by ship.
After the film there is coffee, tea and cake.
Schrilles Piepsen disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily on land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the hold.
The company has several irons in the fire at the site.
In addition to coal imports, Rhenus Midgard relies on wind turbine logistics, among other things.
Black shimmers the coal in the storage area in front of the dike.
Two huge blue holding bulkheads and backloaders distribute or load the coal here as needed.
With each movement of the transhipment devices, a shrill warning noise sounds over the terrain.
"The signals serve security and are required by law," says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, in the case of unfavourable winds, this can be heard far away - and so there were already some complaints from people from the north of the city.
He takes the lawsuits very seriously and has therefore contacted the victims, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, we are now in the process of keeping the warning signals quieter with technical measures.
In the future, he will continue to engage in open dialogue with his neighbours.
Matthias Schrell has a lot going on at the site.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the 18.5-metre-deep tub in front of the terminal, Capesize bulk carriers can also be handled here.
“This year, we want to break the 3-million-tonne mark in the envelope,” Schrell said.
In addition to the Eon power plant on site, the import coal goes to power plants in the interior.
When the GDF Suez power plant goes to the grid, a good 5 million tons of coal imports per year are realistic.
The three ship disembarks on the bridge as well as the second conveyor belt could create up to 10 million.
Bayern basketball player optimistic despite first defeat
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not reduce the huge optimism among the basketball players of FC Bayern Munich.
"No one can forbid us from believing in winning against the best team in Europe in the past two years," Bayern coach Svetislav Pesic said after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday evening at defending champion Olympiakos Piraeus.
We sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
In their first third appearance in the European royal class, the Munichers sold themselves very well for a long time, but were simply not clear enough in the decisive stages.
The guests first managed to convert a 15-point gap 13 minutes before the end into a guided tour before Piraeus gave the game another turn.
"We fought back against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then made ludicrous mistakes again," said Bayern professional Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful pitchers in Munich, who had celebrated significant victories in the first two games against the Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title winner Zielona G<0xC3><0xB3>ra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, the variety artist Frank Fay, who worked as a conférencier at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling the crowd directly jokes in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fay’s innovation has been expanded, as has been the case at the New York Comedy Festival.
Launched and directed by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the stand-up institution Carolines, this year the festival celebrates its ten-year anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
“Most of these headliners started with Carolines and then became more and more successful until at some point they were too famous to perform in a club,” Hirsch said.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue working with them.
This year’s event features appearances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher as well as “Stand Up for Heroes”, an annual music and comedy charity event for army veterans at Madison Square Garden, which features Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival has also grown the world of comedy.
A number of comedians attending the festival this year have come to know about more unconventional ways, such as broadcasts on smaller TV channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became famous with a sitcom on cable television (the ironic-smooth fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the cast on Saturday Night Live as well as Parks and Recreation, although she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, racially focused W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest visitors to the festival is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has evolved into a respected television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he hosted a TV show titled “Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg” on TV Land.
The meeting will take place at the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry’s entire work,” Steinberg said.
He told me, when he's here, he sometimes goes through the street between two buildings and thinks, "Hey, if I lose all my money, I might live here."
Iran Satisfied with Nuclear Negotiations Process
Iran appears a week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN vetoes and Germany satisfied with the negotiation process.
“After years, we now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to eliminate the differences of the last few years,” Foreign Minister Mohammed Jawad Sarif wrote on his Facebook page.
It would be a long way to go, but the nuclear negotiator is satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that in the end both sides will come to a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys kill matchmaking cards with machete
Two children confessed to the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14 and 12-year-old boys had invited their victims to go on a bird hunt with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they stabbed the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, the newspaper "El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s" reported on Thursday.
Then they played football in front of their apartments in a working-class neighborhood.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach town of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the young man they had taken with them was said to have been sexually assaulted by the boy.
However, when the girl described the tathering in front of the police without mentioning an attack against her, the two boys admitted the deliberate killing of the 11-year-old.
As a reason, the elder called, among other things, a rivalry in the football game.
He was admitted to a psychiatric youth institution for the time being.
Salary must go to prison
Because of exploitative human trafficking, pimping, threat, insult and dangerous bodily injury, the Konstanz District Court has sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison.
The former Bundeswehr soldier, who worked as a doorkeeper after two operations in Afghanistan, made a confession in the context of a trial agreement.
According to him, in five cases he met women via internet or telephone contacts, which he sent to the line after a few weeks against their will.
He used to break resistance with violence and threats.
He retained the income of the women who, in part, bought for him for years.
By confiscation of mobile phones and SIM cards, he undercut women’s contacts to the outside world.
Together with a colleague who taught the women, he brought them to various brothels in the southwest.
There he had them partly monitored to control their revenues.
In court, the defendant initially claimed that he was suffering from a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan next to him were killed in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert raised a great deal of doubt about the psychological limitation and thus a limited liability, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court no longer had to hear from any of the injured women.
According to one Kripo official, at least four further cases of exploitative trafficking could be identified after a first report by telephone surveillance measures.
The interrogated conversations were marked by high aggression.
In later interrogations, the injured had confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, in which one of the women had spotted bruises all over her body, had not made a statement to this day.
It is a “completely broken personality” that sees violence and exploitation in this metaphor as normal.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He has separated from these circles and wants to live a normal life after detention," he said.
Oil price goes on up to USD 96 per barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday after concerns over a high supply overshadowed a report that saw China’s energy-hungry manufacturing sector grow.
The reference crude oil for deliveries in December had fallen by 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel in late-morning Europe in electronic commerce on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a price decline of 5.8 percent in October.
The large crude oil supply has been burdening prices in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that the U.S. supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, the supply had increased by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there were indications of stronger demand through two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This indicates a continued recovery in China’s economy, whose growth had risen to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after reaching its lowest level in the previous quarter for two decades.
Brent crude, a reference value for international crude oil also used by U.S. refineries, fell 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel on the ICE Exchange in London.
Court Blocks NYPD Stop-and-Fresh Policy Decision
A federal appeals court in the U.S. blocked on Thursday the order of a judge who had requested changes to the stop-and-frisk program (“stop and search”) of the New York Police Department, and dismissed the judge from the case.
The 2nd U.S. Appeals Court declared that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until a city appeal was decided.
The judge ruled in August that the city violated the constitution with the way the program for arresting and questioning people was implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the remedial measures ordered, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police in amending its directive and the appropriate training programme.
On Tuesday, the appeals court heard the arguments for the required suspension.
The appeals report stated that the judge had to be released from the case because she violated the Code of Conduct for U.S. judges by determining that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the court’s criticism.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they purposefully targeted black and Latin American men with the stop-and-frisk program.
She appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of significant changes, including reforms in policies, training and service supervision, and arranged a pilot program with body-worn cameras in neighborhoods where most controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were released after police control.
An oral hearing on the city’s vocation is planned after 14 March 2014.
The Stop-and-Fresh tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.
Controls of this kind have been in various forms for decades, but the number of controls recorded during the term of office of the unbiased mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men who belonged to all minorities filed a lawsuit that developed into a class action lawsuit.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD’s Stop-and-Frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trusted and effective police force, as well as influence the way other police bureaus use the scheme.
Opponents believe that the changes would dampen the morale of the police, but not crime; they would also waste money and not solve the broader problem of a police force that has been under pressure after thousands of jobs have been dropped in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that it did not end the stop-and-frisk practice that was constitutional, but only reformed the way controls were implemented by the NYPD.
The Happiness of Dreaming Camels
Happiness is an oasis that manages to reach only dreaming camels
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Helfende H<0xC3><0xA4>nde".
On Saturday afternoon, the tenth birthday of the association was celebrated, which can already have considerable successes.
The first chairman Henne reported in detail on the work of the association.
He himself was the first time in Mauritania in 2004 at the Cheijk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, further cooperation developed, and the gynecologist Henne carried out numerous operations on site on several trips.
During the speeches, pictures of the stakes were shown on a large screen, so that the guests of the anniversary event could get a picture of the above-mentioned actions.
The desert vehicle of the association was also shown.
It is a former Federal Border Protection Vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had made the proposal to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now, according to Henne, plans to work at the association in an advisory function.
In 2008, Zimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn created the hospital in Socogim, a poor district on the outskirts of the capital, in the record time of just under a week.
He also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Particularly interesting in times when the birth clinic is to be rationalized away in Nagold.
You learn a lot in Africa as a physician, according to Henne, for example, acceleration against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, it was not possible to make as many trips as planned, but many medical professionals came to Germany to host in different areas.
In addition, containers with material are regularly sent to Africa, according to this March this year medical devices, medicines, dressing materials, hospital beds and glasses.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself provided plenty of local colour by telling from Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles converted to the mobile goat stable and describing the experiences of the Stammheim musicians, who traditionally support the association, during their Mauritanian journey.
As his personal motivations, he called his work in the area of auditing as a young MP.
When he realized how much money was lost on the road, he decided to help the Africans control a budget by the people.
In addition, Fuchtel stressed that the global economy also demands global human love.
It should not be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
From Gran Canaria it is not far to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip
Former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used “telephone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation” in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair by then Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court at Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his “attractive special counsel” Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's voicemails, and prosecuted them, but Coulson also called them and left messages as the court learned.
“According to the prosecutor’s office, Coulson, who is now the editor of the NotW, is no one who stands in front of people’s homes and hopes to catch them up on fresh action, but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction,” Edis explained.
He said NotW uses three methods to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously, he knows about the second, the surveillance, otherwise it can't be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He denies this, but we say, “And if he knew.”
Rumors about Clarke’s affair were first picked up by NotW’s feature editorial when a source who was sexually interested in Pawlby was told, “Don’t waste your time, she’s with Charles.”
A tape containing voicemails from her phone of at least three occasions was secured in Mulcaire's apartment in August 2006.
The investigators also found entries on the detective's computer where Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects".
During the time the research ran, Pawlby’s grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised the movement of Pawlby.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following message: “I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow, about which I would like to talk to Charles.”
Edis explained that Coulson’s activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had faced a married woman for an affair when he himself had lied to fellow defendant Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks argue off having conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted phone hacking.
In protest against the planned wealth tax, French football will actually go through the first strike since 1972.
A conciliation meeting comes to an end without results.
In the conflict over wealth tax, the government and professional football in France have maneuvered into a dead end after a failed conciliation meeting.
President Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande received a representative of the association and association at the Paris <0xC3><0x89>lysée Palace on Thursday and listened to their complaints.
However, he refused to spare the football from the planned 75 percent tax on income of more than one million euros per year, which all companies of the country are to pay for two years from 2014.
The opposite side was also hard.
The strike announced at the end of November will now be continued, the head of the Association of Professional Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, said.
The match days set between 29 November and 2 December in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 will therefore be cancelled.
Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the residents early in the planning," Mayor Jens H<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0x9F>ler opened the Citizens Information Event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants had come to the municipal hall to have the planned measures explained, to ask questions, to express concerns and to contribute ideas.
H<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0x9F>ler made clear: "The final decisions are made by the members of the municipal council".
The flood, which hit Gechingen unprepared on 15 May 2009, was a cutting-edge event that raised the question of protection measures for the future, H<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0x9F>ler said.
A river basin survey was commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The protection of as many buildings as possible is the goal," says H<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0x9F>ler.
The planning of protection against floods that are statistically expected every 100 years according to the German Weather Service has been carried out.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15% surcharge.
In specialist circles, this is referred to as "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masses that caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009 corresponded to a 1000-year flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," said H<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0x9F>ler.
In order to achieve the protection HQ 100aKlima, around four million euros must be invested in Gechingen, with the municipality able to expect state grants of around 70 percent.
However, H<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0x9F>ler pointed out that there is only funding if an overall concept is implemented.
For this purpose, the community is dependent on the participation of the citizens.
A complex planning and approval process must be completed.
In the best case, the implementation could be started in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept, which was already presented last week in the municipal council (we reported) provides for local measures in the inflow of the Irm river from the Stammheim valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to contribute their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why more dams and retaining basins were not planned to protect the site.
Gregor Kühn, expert planner of the commissioned engineering office Wald and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, emphasized that it requires the interplay of all the measures presented to achieve the desired goal in total.
In addition, the most economical solution is to be found, according to Joachim Wald von Wald and Corbe.
Uncouth prevails in the old town’s tenants, who, even in the case of normal thunderstorms, have repeatedly suffered from overloading of the canal network.
The problem is known in the administration and the first measures have already been taken.
However, H<0xC3><0xA4>üssler pointed out that the guidelines for canal systems are different from those for flood protection and that this should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to design the canal network in such a way that two to three years of rain events could be endured.
By sizing the sewers larger, millions would be devouring.
Severely injured after collision
In the early Friday afternoon, two drivers were seriously injured in a frontal collision on Landesstra<0xC3><0x9F>e 44 near Revensdorf.
The police immediately closed the road completely, but could initially say little about the accident.
However, there are various witness statements that should only be evaluated.
It is certain that the 19-year-old driver of a VW Golf drove towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collided, with the woman being so severely jammed that the fire department needed almost half an hour to free her from the vehicle wreck.
The actual cause of the accident was initially unexplained.
Both of the victims came to nearby hospitals.
The route remained closed for about two hours.
It could be called the Dostoevsky of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a seeker of God, a metaphysician, his novels and stories also have something serial.
Astounding the relationship in the exterior: the piercing eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And just as Fyodor M. Dostoevsky, with his massive oeuvre, is to be understood as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, one reads Philip K. Dick as an American prophet, who is certainly considered something in his own country.
Some titles have been published by Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories distributes two thousand one.
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technical progress, coupled with paranoia, security craze and the belief to be chosen.
Dick had experiences of God, his late books read like a mixture of the Revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, had drugs added to his brain.
He has hijacked, early on, that the computers are divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine, the creator from his creature.
This is the Blade Runner problem.
The killing.
A Master of Science Fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The "Minority Report" dates back to 1956, it exudes the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunale.
The principle of “pre-crime” is being developed here, “pre-crime”, that is, what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick’s world, which resembles ours in horror, mutants look to the future – and the police are approaching.
“We are capturing individuals who have not violated any law,” the agency’s chief said.
"We'll catch them before they can commit a violent crime".
And: "In our society there are no serious criminals, for that we have a criminal camp full of pesudover criminals".
They assume that bad things happen and prevent the criminal thought from being put into practice.
Dick’s narrative acts like the blueprint for the NSA’s anti-terror laws and interception noise.
Anticipation of the attack: This is how Obama’s drone philosophy and practice works.
But Dick’s story is not over yet.
The chief of police complains that there is no more division of power, the military controls everyday life – and what is left of the state.
Then the monitor itself is monitored and transferred to a future crime.
The system goes through.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It invents its own prerequisites.
Don’t just buy errors and sacrifices, but build on them.
The system creates the danger it is fighting.
Reading Philip K. Dick means getting closer to the truth over and over again.
Report on Merkel's spying affair in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. spy affair surrounding Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German federal prosecution could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia, the agency Interfax reported.
The Greens had met Hans-Christian Ströbele yesterday as the first German politician Snowden in Moscow to talk to him about the affair.
NSA revelations strengthen corporate paranoia due to state surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep over the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt am Main, the financial capital of Germany.
At the direction of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and Counter-Terrorism (BVT), the German Internal Intelligence Service, he should photograph the roof of the U.S. outpost, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Federal Bank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a change of words between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, once again insisted in September that the U.S. did not use foreign espionage capabilities to “steal the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies so that they could expand their international competitiveness or profit.”
But since Edward Snowden, the former whistleblower, has begun publishing his fillet of U.S. surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure if they can take the director to the floor.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency is spying on Brazilian oil company Petrobas and has acquired data from U.S. cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have brought the company’s paranoia to a new high for state surveillance.
The barrel to overflow revealed that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been tangled, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then corporate executives are certainly also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between US intelligence agencies and companies transparent.
I think it is conceivable that this data will be used for mutual benefit.
“Germany needs to wake up,” explains Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the U.S. posed almost as much risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by the consulting firm EY.
However, in Snowden’s leaked documents, there has been no evidence to date that the U.S. has passed on the operating secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed their concern that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet opportunities and that it should reduce its dependence on the US.
Companies are skeptical about this.
In the Bundestag it was proposed that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“This is not how it works,” says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you shouldn’t have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Anything but the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the reach and technical sophistication of the US spy agencies uncovered by the Snowden revelations have shocked companies that had previously seen the greatest spying risk in China.
Cloud computing is undergoing a major change because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject to jurisdiction and therefore potentially endangered.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, about 10 percent of non-U.S.-based members rejected plans to use an American provider after the disclosures about U.S. data mining activities with Prism.
Jim Snabe, deputy CEO of SAP, says: “We see a new question from customers that didn’t exist a year ago – it’s: Where will my data be stored and can you guarantee that these will remain physically in this legal space?”
Many German business leaders believe that the latest reports simply confirm what they already knew anyway, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore have to be guarded at all costs.
The fact that economic espionage is taking place is no surprise.
That's always been the case.
“It has been a topic for many years and has not fundamentally changed through the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans spy on us on a commercial and industrial level, just as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
Corporate governance usually does not boast about the countermeasures that have been taken, because this gives attackers advantages.
In large companies, employees have long been told that taking a free USB flash drive at a trade fair or unattended lying on a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberk, a board member at Audi, says that it has been standard practice for years to collect the mobile phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as hearing aids.
The German BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid phones when traveling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their niche.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorized access,” the BVT said in a report.
The U.S. warns its own companies against economic espionage from other countries.
According to the Washington Post, in February, the US National Intelligence Estimate ranked France, Russia, and Israel behind China as two of the countries that used to obtain economic data from hacking.
A board member of a German blue chip company agreed when it comes to economic espionage, then “the French are the worst”.
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French Interior Intelligence Agency (DCRL), was quoted this month in an interview as saying: “The intelligence services know very well that all countries, even when they work together in the fight against terror, are spying on their allies.”
Hechingen: Trade fair gives answer to wedding questions
“Marriage is the most important journey of discovery that man can make,” said philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips on how at least the wedding party succeeds now gave a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Representatives were important providers around a wedding.
A trend: The retro look has kept moving again.
It starts with the wedding dresses.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
At the front, the often smoked and embroidered dresses are closed, often with a veil, but at the back they go down the back and often end up in a drag.
However, as Stefanie Koch points out from the fashion house Kleidermüller, the ghosts divorce.
For men, the suit dominates with vest and plastron, but cream-colored or brown combinations can also be chosen.
The choice of the venue is important, it was explained.
Jewelryless side rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be special.
Here, the domain drew attention to its own offer in the draw.
If you want to go ahead with the carriage, Uwe Link has an offer for you.
“Cuts are also popular for bachelor parties,” he says.
Romance is also required for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
More and more fashionable are the "after-wedding photo" - i.e. recording series in special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the party, but in wedding clothes, explained Elisabeth Keidel.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sunday.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cake and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests stylishly.
Not to forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
All for an unforgettable party.
Dog Friends Successfully
Once again, the athletes of the dog lovers Bitz were successful on a rally-obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his dog Sandy he scored 94 points in the beginner class and secured fifth place, and with the 15-month-old Marley he put it in twelfth place with 87 points.
Susi Höpp, with her Woody in Class 1, faced the critical gaze of the performance judge.
Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The teenager’s parents, whose body was found in a rolled-up ringer mat in his high school gym, are convinced that her son was murdered, the family’s lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the U.S. state of Georgia was found on January 11 in a upright mat standing behind the stand in the school gym.
Lowndes County Sheriff's Office officials concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old's family doubted it.
“They are convinced that their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, Kenneth’s and Jacquelyn Johnson’s attorney, told FoxNews.com.
They never thought he had died the way the sheriff had concluded.
“They believe that it is beyond any logic that violates the laws of physics as well as common sense,” said Crump.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth is concealed to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
“Your son went to school to learn and came back in the body bag,” he commented.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday there will be a formal investigation into Johnson’s death, as a number of important issues are still unclear.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
Moore said this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts, in whatever direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
“I believe there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation,” he said.
Moore told reporters the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson had died from the consequences of a “position-related suffocation.”
However, a second autopsy has resulted in another cause of death, Moore said.
“There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed,” he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence of a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson’s death, he will commission the FBI to conduct the investigation.
A representative of the County Sheriff's Office was not immediately ready to comment on our request on Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia on Wednesday ordered authorities to release all surveillance videos that the investigators reviewed.
The teenager’s parents said they hoped the video footage contained clues as to how he died.
CDC publishes allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for dealing with food allergies of children in schools.
These are the first such guidelines issued by the U.S. government as the number of school-age children with food allergies increases.
One in 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
The prevalence of food allergies among children has increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007, according to the CDC.
The guidelines provide information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine in stock – the auto-injection of the EpiPen brand is most commonly used – in order to be able to face a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
Lawmakers in the states have recently changed the regulations to make it easier for schools to keep epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms that are called by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “It feels like something is pressing on my tongue,” “My tongue feels like a hair is on it,” or “My tongue is tingling.”
Parents of intersex children can choose “gender indefinite”
Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is recognized for children born with unequivocal genitalia.
Newborns are no longer assigned rigidly male or female.
According to the new law, parents no longer have to declare gender for such children, but can state “undefined” or “undefined” on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure of parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions regarding operations for sex assignment in newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
According to the BBC, an intersex person said years later: “I am neither male nor female.”
I remain the patchwork created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children is born each year neither as a boy nor as a girl.
They belong to the intersex, a group that falls under the diagnosis of “sexual differentiation disorder” (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germs (ovules or testicles) or unusually developed genitalia.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Understanding gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the U.S. recommend using the best available information on gender assignment if a provision is not possible, and not waiting for the psychological and physical development of the child before deciding – if at all – for surgery.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the issue of gender identification, said the new German law “sounds like a good thing.”
Intersex children are an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening conditions that require surgical intervention, but most children don’t,” he said.
You can do a sex assignment without surgery and then wait for the identity to develop.
The scientific data on how a child develops his or her gender identity at all is not very accurate.
No one knows why it happens.
It’s like the secret to why people are gay.
A 2011 report to the European Commission states that intersex people are different from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not gender-based, but conditioned by their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.
These properties were shown in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination that intersex and transgender people face in their professional lives, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Boys who do not conform to the gender picture now have a special camp.
In Australia and Nepal, it is now possible for adults to indicate male, female or “third sex” on official documents.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world’s first “sexless” person after a court granted life-long retention of an “undefined” gender status.
In addition to M and W, German ID cards will have a third assignment, X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French members of the strictly Catholic country signed a petition calling for the “gender theory” to be removed from textbooks.
The Catholic Online website has also opposed German law, stating: “If the world is being torn into a new state where gender is a decision, but sexual activity is not, then we are twisting two more pillars of civilization.”
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to Baby Zone that she would find it better if babies were assigned a gender at birth.
“Parenting is stressful enough even without further restrictions, especially if you don’t know the gender of your own child,” she said.
Children need stability and safety.
Historically, children born with both male and female sexes were called hermaphrodites, according to the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, medicine considered gender to be something you can erase and then rebuild.
But now the ethical foundations of an operation are doubted, after it is now known how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the gender assigned to them.
“In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a ‘psychiatric emergency’,” Drescher said.
When such a child was born, they did not call the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory of treating children with unequivocal genitalia dates back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who expressed the view that gender was malleable.
He coined the term “sexual identity” and argued social and environmental impulses – such as parents raising a child – interacted with a child’s genes and hormones, thus shaping whether a person considers himself male or female.
But in a 1966 case known as "John/Joan", his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been severed by a bruised circumcision to castrate the child completely and also to remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
“Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, but it was not,” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he switched back to the male sex and married a woman.
At 38, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
However, in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these sex operations came to the public, who are “not happy with the result”.
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana who was born with XY male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitals.
Doctors were not aware of whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a “satisfactory life” as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found was shocking.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After learning the truth, he switched back to male identity, received testosterone injections, and had his breasts removed.
Through the operation, he became infertile.
Today, he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project to see intersex people as normal.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, Managing Director of the California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law can “encourage stamping and stigmatizing”.
“Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign a ‘not defined’ to the child,” she said.
We fear this will favour interventions.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we still don’t know how the law will affect us, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because “it allows adults to be recognized as third gender.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender,” she said.
The German law is about the assignment at birth.
This is not a fight to force young children at this time.
When they are grown up, they can decide for themselves about their body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburg who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says the German law “empowers” both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Because of the prescription defect of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today, Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in child psychiatry.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to be able to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.
“The law gives parents space, so they don’t have to make rushed decisions,” Baratz said.
It gives them time to do various tests and clarify things and thus gives them time before writing “male” or “female.”
In this way, everything is fine – you raise the child and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and you enjoy the happiness of your parents.
And you don’t have to rush an operation that can’t be reversed.
“This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are driving because they think they wouldn’t do the right thing,” she explained.
Ultimately, the child decides on the sex that suits him better – and that’s wonderful.
This will enable children to make the decision themselves.
Unknown Injured Girls By Shot From Car
Unknowns have injured a 12-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt in gunfire from a car.
The perpetrators had probably fired on a group of children in Ghent on Thursday evening with an air pressure weapon.
The police said that in the castle.
The girl was slightly injured on the left calf.
Rescuers took the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A disc broke.
Then they drove away.
The police found out, it was called Friday.
Until now, the Kempten Police Inspectorate can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were only called twice to ovulating children, who threw them against house facades.
Since the homeowners recognized this in time and removed the eggs immediately, no damage should have occurred either.
In addition, some Sylvesterböllers were also lit in the urban area, but also here no material damage has occurred.
A resident in the Bischof-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped with toilet paper and his bicycle screens were stolen.
Until the police arrived, however, the man found his radar screens all again in the immediate vicinity, which is why the police did not have to continue to operate.
Living with a future perspective
Waltraud Ries actually lives dreamlike.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery, an old tree stock, nice neighbors and also not too much traffic.
In the city it is only a few minutes by public transport.
"Hopefully you're not afraid of spiders?" asks Waltraud Ries, pointing to a fat spider on the door frame.
I have been looking for a new home for my husband and me for some time now.
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not spider phobia, but the concern of not being able to cope with the many stairs to the house and in the apartment at the age, she explains.
In addition: Since a Meniscus operation, the fifty-something woman has had to experience on her own, what it means to move from floor to floor with handicap.
Recently, a book by her has appeared on the subject of 'Happy Living in Age - What kind of home is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what doesn't work at all in old age,' she begins to tell.
When she moved into the Maisonette apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the countryside.
Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it today with the mid-fifties.
But she also knows that she is one of the few people who even deal with the topic of 'living in old age'.
Most people will push it as long as they can.
“It’s always going to be old,” she says grinning.
Only when the suffering pressure is really high will you think.
"It may be too late," said Ries.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 residential models for self-determined living in old age.
“What type of home you choose is always an individual decision,” she explains.
D e solution does not exist for age.
Even those who can afford a retirement home in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that they can also get sick.
And: 'Without a good knowledge of the national language, one also unites in the Dolce Vita,' the specialist book author gives to consider those willing to relocate.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative forms of housing or the often cited pensioner-WG.
In old age, everyone has their ticks and macks.
'For me, such a community would be nothing,' she says with a blink of an eye.
Not at all like in a student WG with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
'In old age, you just need your retreats,' Ries says.
However, the author does not want to rule out the fact that a senior housing community can still work.
However, this must be different than in the classic Student-WG.
And sometimes you just want to rest," she believes.
With this opinion, it is not alone in the state capital at least.
"Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment for as long as possible," is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the Civil Service Life at the age of the state capital.
Their office advises people around the topic of 'ageing'.
Therefore, especially older people would often also take advantage of inconveniences and restrictions, only to be able to stay in their usual environment, that is also the experience of the Warentest Foundation.
Today, there are many ways to make the house or apartment barrier-free.
Ries recommends that anyone who deals with the age-appropriate renovation of their home or apartment should first be thoroughly informed and not commissioned to become the first craftsman.
Today, there are also specialists for age-appropriate conversion.
Even in the rental apartment, one or the other can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the interior designer clears up.
But not always the existing apartment can be remodeled age-appropriately and thus barrier-free, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to be done by Waltraud Ries.
Although you could install a stair lift inside the apartment, the way paved with stairs to the apartment door would be the much bigger obstacle.
She will continue to search until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before the move, it is more cruel to her than to the spider at her apartment door.
U.S. wants Snowden to continue criminal prosecution
The U.S. has not changed its stance on former U.S. intelligence officer Edward Snowden.
He continues to be accused of illegally passing on secret information.
Therefore, he had to face a criminal trial in the United States, said U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
Even Snowden’s recent statements would not change that.
Previously, German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the United States after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow to stop threatening him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that Ströbel’s remarks were about a parliamentarian’s, not a German government member’s.
Edward Snowden is basically ready to talk to German authorities.
First of all, he wants to know his situation.
This was made clear by the former NSA employee sought by the US in an unaddressed letter published by Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government, the Bundestag and the Federal Attorney General.
According to a translation published by Ströbele, the letter has the following wording:
To the responsibilities
I was asked to write to you regarding your investigation into mass surveillance.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and I was previously employed by the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) as a technical expert.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I became a witness to systematic violations of the law of my government, which caused me to act out of a moral duty.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I was exposed to a serious and persistent hoax that forced me to leave my family and my home.
I am currently living in exile and enjoying temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political actions, both in the US and elsewhere.
Citizens all over the world and also high officials – including the United States – have judged the revelations to be a system of comprehensive surveillance that is not accountable to anyone as a service to the public.
These espionage revelations entailed many proposals for new laws and guidelines aimed at the previously covert abuse of public trust.
The benefits to society from these findings are becoming increasingly clearer; at the same time, the risks taken into consideration have been visibly reduced.
Although the outcome of my efforts was demonstrably positive, my government still treats Dissens as a breach of loyalty and strives to criminalize and prosecute political expression of opinion.
But speaking the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the Government of the United States will adopt this derogatory stance with the support of the international community.
I hope that, when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved, I will be able to participate in the responsible clarification of the facts concerning the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports, in an appropriate and legal manner.
I look forward to a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to uphold the international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden attested by Hans-Christian Ströbele
Kindergarten has found a private buyer
“The building is in good hands,” says Winterlingen Mayor Michael Maier.
The former kindergarten in Gartenstra<0xC3><0x9F>e has sold the municipality to a private person.
The local council agreed to the sale in its most recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner at an "appropriate" price.
"The community is satisfied," Maier said.
The budget was set at EUR 100 000.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen has handed over responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter and thus no longer has to stand up for the entertainment of the house, such as heating, looking for the garden and clearing the walkway.
"This effort is now gone," Maier rejoices.
Space concert at high summer temperatures
The Musikverein Hammereienbach gives a concert on the terrace of the inn Hammer.
When conductor Bianca Willmann raises the bar at 7.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammrich musicians.
The chairman Manuela Honeck explains the pieces of music.
In this context, Honeck thanked all those who had helped to successfully manage the first musician’s shock.
Obama campaign to replace Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama’s closest advisers have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign, according to the New York Times.
The unveiling is the most notable surprise of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's long-awaited work on the 2012 election campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times is a copy of the forthcoming book, and it reported on Thursday evening that the president’s top advisers had conducted “extensive group meetings and polls at the end of 2011” to find out if Obama’s dwindling hope for re-election would be better off if he dropped Biden.
According to Jonathan Martin, National Political Correspondent of the Times, the book thoroughly traces the history of the campaign’s and the White House’s efforts to measure, in particular, the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, what effect it has on poll scores to exchange former Secretary of State Clinton with the vice president.
The potential change was a tightly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and in the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president’s closest advisers – including Daley, former campaign leader of Obama, Jim Messina, and former White House senior adviser, David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the intended change.
In “Double Down,” it is claimed that Daley had been at the forefront of efforts to exchange Biden despite their “close personal relationship” before finally deciding against such a move after the data showed that Clinton’s candidacy “would not significantly improve Obama’s chances.”
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
“I put out a whole series of things to consider, and that was one of them,” Daley told the magazine.
One has to remember that the president had terrible polls back then, so we thought, “For God’s sake, what are we doing?”
While Daley described the investigations as “providing care,” Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that during the campaign for re-election, considerable effort had been made to find out if such a move would pay off in terms of ballot boxes.
“In campaigns, not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups unless you seriously think about something,” Martin told AC360.
It is not clear whether Obama knew his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss at the time knew about the potential change.
Although Daley said he didn’t believe the president was “conscious” about the possible change, the former chief of staff admitted that it was “possible” that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that “Double Down” did not provide a definitive answer to whether the political probes had reached Obama’s desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama didn’t know anything about whether to drop Biden in the election.
“Perhaps,” Martin replied.
What happens on the go with my e-mail?
Email is actually an electronic letter.
Was the design of the Internet service e-mail similar to the traditional mail technically implemented the letter secret?
When designing the early Internet services, the focus was on making communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols did not take care to provide a stable basis for a sound exchange of letters.
Therefore, a conventional email is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter.
If the user sends "Anna" a mail to "Benni", are the computers of the two then directly connected?
In the first step, Anna’s email program or browser sends the mail to her service provider’s mail server.
For example, if you have a Gmail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the route, the mail can run over several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content from his provider.
Are traditional e-mails being read on their way through the network?
Most mails are read by software robots on the go several times.
The sender’s provider usually checks whether the mail carries a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also performed on the recipient systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is a annoying and unwanted spam email that is deleted immediately or at least sorted away into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
For systems such as Gmail, the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate via email about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can display corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people read the emails?
The likelihood of unauthorized persons reading an email is extremely low.
Theoretically, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
The law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies also have legal means to intercept or take notice of e-mails.
In addition, there are possible illegal spying actions.
Is it possible to protect emails from reading?
Encryption according to the OpenPGP standard allows an e-mail to be effectively encrypted against read-through.
It is also possible to hide the metadata of an e-mail communication with great technical effort, so that it is not even possible to easily recognize who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google in the email market in Germany?
Yahoo and Google play only a minor role in the mainly privately used mailboxes, according to a August 2013 study by Convios Consulting.
While the shares of Yahoo mail had recently fallen, GMail was able to grow significantly from Google.
Mother locked up in the forest and pension cashed
When his late mother died, a man from Wolfsburg made a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pension and care allowance.
A 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother in the forest after police investigated him.
At first, he hid the death of the 89-year-olds, then he had spent the money more than a year and a half.
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud, as a spokesman said on Friday.
According to him, the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected as early as May: At that time, it became apparent that no medication was needed for the mother in need of care.
Investigators told the pensioner that his mother had travelled to Spain.
Because the officers found this strange, they continued to investigate.
It turned out that the two had lived in a shared apartment for more than 15 years and he had last cared for them.
The 67-year-old finally admitted his mother's death.
An autopsy revealed no evidence of a capital crime, according to police.
Looking for ice cream that glows in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first ice cream that glows in the dark – using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a luminous treat.
The idea came to him after reading a research on jellyfish and convincing Chinese scientists to artificially produce the glowing protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when consumed, increasing the pH in the protein and triggering the lightening.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the heat in your mouth and shines – the more you lick, the lighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company “Lick Me I’m Delicious”, says: “The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds.”
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth heats the protein, the pH increases and the ice lights up.
We tested it in the last few months and it seemed ideal to bring it to the market on Halloween because it has this wonderful lighting effect.
It’s probably the most expensive ice cream I’ve ever made, because the jellyfish light is four times more expensive than gold.
Each bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But for that, it tastes delicious.
Charlie’s Bristol-based experimental company is famous for its unusual flavours, including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his latest creation will become even more ambitious.
He says, “I’d like to develop an invisible ice cream.”
This is in and of itself impossible because of the breakage of light caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream; but I suspect we find a way to create it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish artificially made by Chinese scientists
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the handball league after six days of play.
For the team of Ingo Ehlers, the Derby against TSV Daverden is coming tomorrow, which celebrated its first victory last weekend.
With this game, the season starts again for us.
“I hope we finally have our heads free,” Ehlers says optimistically.
Finally, with the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme, he has his complete squad at his disposal.
Like us, Daverden also relies on tempo play.
Therefore, we need to keep our error rate low.
First of all, however, it is important to increase in coverage, which has lately left everything but a safe impression.
Daverden’s coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after his first season win against Nordhorn.
The game was, of course, a house number.
But that’s why we’re not the favorite, because in the derby everything can always happen.
Nevertheless, Panitz now wants to re-enact in Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat is missing.
For this, the A-Jugendliche Joost Wind<0xC3><0x9F><0xC3><0x9F>, who is active with doubles in the A-Jugend-Bundesligisten HC Bremen, is celebrating his season debut.
Anyone who is not hot in such a game should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay up late and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today I'm more of a Halloween muffler.
Over the past two years, I have not agreed to distribute sweets from my apartment, and will probably not do so this year.
But according to statistics, I am a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be exact – are celebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the U.S. Retailers’ Association (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values.
The costumes will make up about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, exciting inanimate objects are the last cry.
Women no longer have to wrap themselves in sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the daft punk spacemen will make it into the Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most popular costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed our dogs last year and were not alone to my surprise.
In fact, Americans spend $330 million this year on costumes of their pets, according to the NRF.
These are a lot of hot dogs.
As far as sweets are concerned, we are not fickle.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
That’s about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, lychees, candy and rubber bears.
So good news for the 41 million people, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, who pull through the neighborhoods with the phrase “sweet or sour.”
In fact, we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let’s not imagine – eat.
The only thing we don’t want to consume is the sugar sweet Candy Corn; nevertheless, 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of confectionery manufacturers.
That's about nine billion corn grains.
It’s a mystery I haven’t solved yet.
Nothing belongs to Halloween more than houses in which it spits.
They have great names such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which by the way stands in a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
There are actually 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States that make $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos you just pee on in your pants and then put your friends on Facebook where you don’t get rid of them again, and one then the guy you’re standing on leaves a comment like “after facial expression.”
But let's finally get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Big Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating the Christmas tree—something we’ve been doing from a young age.
Fortunately, the “baby in pumpkin” trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving the pumpkin and not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern, which slowly rots in the front garden, probably comes from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you want to score right, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve something pretty out of their 921 kilo-heavy pumpkin.
Apartment fire in Helmbrechts: rescue forces salvage charred corpse
The fire brigade had to move out late Thursday evening in Helmbrechts.
A three-family house in the Hof district catches fire on Friday night.
The rescuers rescue a charred body from the house.
Rescuers have found a charred body in a three-family house in a fire in Helmbrechts.
Whether it is a resident is still unclear, as a police spokesman said in Bayreuth.
Late Thursday evening it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the firefighters arrived, the flames were already striking out of a window.
The emergency services went into the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned out completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All the other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesman said.
The building is no longer habitable for the time being.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany’s largest state church has launched an offensive to promote the pastor’s profession.
Background is a possible lack of pastors: The Evangelical Lutheran Landeskirche Hannover expects that the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors will halve by 2030, according to the current situation.
For young people of today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and day schedule yourself.
With Burfien, the Landeskirche commissioned a pastor for the first time in a full-time position to inspire young people to study theology.
Currently, fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology after graduation.
Burfien traces this to the process of desecration: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud".
The profession is characterized by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my schedule and can set my priorities where it matters to me.
Pastors could be very close to people as pastoralists.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well from it.
Certainly, more is paid in the free economy, but theologians would have a safe employer for that.
This meets the young people of today, who are not only concerned with careers, but with meaningful work.
According to the state church, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, around 60 pastors are currently retired each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology study start their vicariate.
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the Harz, Emsland or Wendland, it could become difficult to occupy jobs in the future.
Among other things, Burfien wants to organize study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
Theology studies offered a broad education.
You can even become a federal president.
Land Rover Rally Series Announced
In the interior there are racing seats and six-point harnesses as well as a hands-free system.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with support from bowler-works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, CEO of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The rally customers who come to Bowler have changed.”
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as an accessible path to world-class events.
We are pleased to be able to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the various rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and prepare newcomers for the hardships and reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car – this will be a fun championship.
In addition, there is a training and testing day in February at the Defender Challenge, as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighter called to rescue a dog that was stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock protrusion in a quarry
Cockerspaniel dog Ruby ran away after a minor traffic accident
Three days later, she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in her nauseous location
Firefighters set sail on the rock wall and rescued the dog from safe death
The fire brigade managed to put a dog in safety, which was stuck on a 15 meter high protrusion in a rock wall.
The nine-month-old Cockerspaniel dog Ruby ran away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, to whom the dog belongs, came to the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire to welcome Ruby back and thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their missing dog and published help calls on social networks when she escaped into the quarry after the small traffic accident.
About 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a walker carrying his dog saw the stranded ruby on the 15 meter high heel in the quarry.
The technical rescue team at Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and sailed to rescue Ruby, who was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, a technical rescue team specialist, said: “She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She didn’t move a muscle during her rescue – she was like frozen.
But now she's fine.
She then ate a couple of dog cakes.
This was a rather unusual use.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, a technical rescue team specialist, said: “Ruby had a great deal of luck.”
There was a chance that she was seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for examination, but he found nothing except exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “Watching the rescue was scary.”
I couldn’t believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to hold her back in her arms.
The veterinarian explained that if the exhaustion had become too large and it had collapsed, it would probably have crashed.
Firefighters have done great.
It was really brave what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson of Keighley added, “We were afraid she would fall down, but she stayed up.”
The firefighters were great.
I can hardly believe where she was.
Mick Jagger says he never touched Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she worked as a background singer on Jagger’s 2004 song “Old Habits Die Hard”.
Perry explained that she ate dinner with the old rocker and that “he had drugged me when I was 18.”
She added: “It’s been a long time and he was very nice to me.”
In a statement, a representative of Jaggers, 70, said on Thursday that he “categorically denies that he has ever made any approach attempts at Katy Perry.”
The representative added: “Perhaps she confused him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance at the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Their new album "Prism" landed at number one this week.
George Kerevan: European unbundling gives Scots the choice
A new day, a new horror story to independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed wire-secured border along the Hadrian’s Wall.
Indeed, the Strathclyde template pointed to the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but this did not matter in the headlines, as expected.
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU Member States often adjust their strict rules when it is more favorable for them.
As Scotland is currently not part of the Schengen area, the continued disregard for Brussels would be only a small concession in return for what one really wants from the Scots.
Not really a story.
And one that has come so far in the years that it already resembles a fossil: the first time I heard the “independence means passport control” duck at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to dance after the European pipe?
Why exchange the London yoke for Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great post-war plan for the unification of Europe has come to an end.
With the euro crisis, the project Europe has officially died.
All over the EU, parties are gaining ground that are anti-EU or want to throw the euro overboard as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative Party for Germany – founded only this year – was able to garner almost five million votes in the September Bundestag election and effectively expel the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis is a turning point.
Due to the strict austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in conjunction with the compulsory jacket, in which the national economy is forced to stick to the single currency, many people feel that the project Europe has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – that was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has fixed its members on exchange rates that are beneficial for German exporters – and German politicians would like to do so.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency, Southern Europe can be found with a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred by Berlin.
Behind the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of Brussels’ “green” energy guidelines – a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays double for electricity and quadrupled for gas compared to the United States.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All of the world’s wage fixings do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt is mounting, especially in France, the former cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, France’s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and raise Paris to a level with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and has pushed Europe up its own economic policy, which is what the battered French economy is struggling with.
The result: Marine Le Pen’s right-wing, EU-hostile National Front has just won a decisive by-election and thus referred the ruling Socialists to third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume a split in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What does Le Pen do with its newly gained popularity among the white French of the working class?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and this is very possible – then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to go beyond: in the not too distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will rather become something like the “Europe of the (sovereign) nations” that General de Gaulle favored.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may hold onto the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project, hoping to join the United States.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific region suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where is Scotland in all of this?
We can decide to be a region of (in the final analysis) small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – which includes telling Berlin and Brussels what they can do.
I suspect that Scotland could run quite well in a looser European alliance, provided we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other, similarly thinking countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider doing it the same way as Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and planned) cuts that Labour finance minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition had to answer.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now, only to have a austerity policy imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: growing up faster
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers, according to research.
Physical changes do not immediately mean puberty.
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter is already growing breasts and pubic hair at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time calming parents – usually that’s not a sign that puberty is about to begin,” Kaplowitz explained.
Obvious displays of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and armpit hair, as well as body odor, show up in girls earlier.
Nevertheless, there has been only a slight shift in the age of the menarche (appearance of the first menstrual period) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
“When the development of breasts begins, it still takes at least two to three years to reach the Menarche,” Kaplowitz, also author of the book “Early puberty in girls: the essential guide to dealing with this common problem.”
Time is the most accurate test as puberty progresses.
It is controversial what actually marks the beginning of puberty, but it is “frozen” when breast augmentation is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of eight.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something that a pediatrician can closely monitor.
With faster progress, tests may be indicated by an endichronologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatment methods to delay early menstruation and ward off another consequence: the premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for a drug or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about drugs, but he admits: “Suppressing puberty can alleviate behavior problems and girls’ feelings of being different from their peers.”
The other big problem is understandable: parents just don’t want their very young daughters to have the period.
“They worry about the risk of pregnancy or about how they handle the hygienic side,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls a woman whose daughter was given ten days of her life.
Although there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was emotionally unprepared.
She came home scared and excited from school because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media would be the cause.
Boys come into puberty similar to girls in the past.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported conducting a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine years, which establishes a link between body fat and entering puberty.
Other research supports this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another mystery: Although boys’ facial and pubic hair grows earlier, the trend towards a full-fledged earlier puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even in babies and toddlers.
“We need to be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get advice from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
“This may mean that you have to have a conversation earlier than expected,” Kaplowitz said.
If you stay calm, the child usually responds well.
Girls who bloom early need insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers argue over seat width in the face of large orders
Between leading aircraft manufacturers, there has been a dispute over the width of tourist-class seats on long-haul flights, indicating the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the seat width offered to passengers on long-haul flights in the tourist class – not always the ones that airlines strive for the most, but this designated space is the key to the efficiencies of Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.’s latest aircraft.
Airbus called for an industry standard this week that requires a minimum of 46 cm (18 inches) of seat width in the tourist class, but Boeing, the U.S. arch rival, says that should be decided by airlines.
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft, and record orders are expected at the event from 17 to 21 November.
How the rear part of the aircraft is designed – especially if there are rows of nine or ten seats – is crucial for the stated economic results that the new “mini jumbo” design is to deliver.
Boeing claims its modernized 777X holds 406 people at tourist-class seats over 17 inches wide, allowing 10 per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 transports 350 people in 18-inch wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aircraft giants often hand out hiebe about technical details by means of advertising in the specialist press.
Airbus is now appealing ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to make the race, directly to the public.
Recently, the company presented an ad that could be the beginning of a new ad war and showed lenders a picture of three people being squeezed into a restaurant, and the title: “Would you accept that?”
“Boeing suggests long-haul flights in seats that are tighter than regional turbo props,” Airbus sales chief John Leahy said.
In the face of changing dietary habits, people are getting thicker, but airplane seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-haul journey, and by the end of the century, the weight of the male average American between 40 and 49 years has increased by ten percent, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The waist circumference of the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival adheres to a 1950s seating concept when the average body circumference of the newly baptized jet set was narrower.
According to Airbus, studies showed that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increased sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing denies Airbus's figures on seat dimensions and says it is not at the discretion of manufacturers to decide how airlines shape the balance between air fares and facilities.
The company also explains that, according to investigations, the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the seat width.
“It’s really about giving airlines flexibility so they can do what they think they need to do to succeed,” Boeing cabin expert Kent Craver said in a statement.
They don’t want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
You know your business better than anyone else.
For passengers it is about more elbow freedom, but for manufacturers it is increasingly becoming a topic that can affect sales.
The competition is behind a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion according to list prices over the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the export balance of the US or Europe.
As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the dispute over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-haul designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing’s statements on the results depend in part on the 777X being compared with the original design of nine seats in the 777 with its ten seats per row.
The increased cost per unit is still lower than for currently used machines with ten seats per row.
“Boeing therefore squeezes more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive for our products,” said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s indicated that many passengers opted for the tighter arrangement, which could be associated with cheaper airfares.
“Eighteen inches of seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offering is controlled by the threat posed by the 777,” says Mary Kirby, expert in cabin setup, founder and publisher of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but rather a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world-traveling jet sellers even carry tape dimensions in order to measure the setup in the competition.
Even if they claim comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with a high-density design for low-cost lines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seat series, but has not yet sold one, according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus has emphasized the importance of more adaptability of the cabins and offered wide seats on the corridors for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say the call for a new industry standard is likely to be pummeled, but could distract from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could make the pleasure of smoking go away
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Before testing on humans, further tests are needed, which may take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were good.
“We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to stop trying all the methods available on the market, but had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches,” Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, causing a smoker to experience no nicotine high.
In experiments, vaccinated mice administered nicotine maintained their normal activity level.
Mice without vaccination, on the other hand, would have taken a “time off,” the researchers explained, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccines had to be given so frequently to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower, as it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans, if he is quite sure, could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
But more likely, smokers would use it to stop.
“They then know that when they start smoking again, they don’t feel any pleasure anymore because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them to put off the habit,” he explains.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned at the same time that further research was needed.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Joe Tripodi, a former minister of the New South Wales Labor Party, is being investigated by state corruption authorities.
The former NSW minister denies having changed the rules on maritime leases at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who owned covert holdings on three properties on state-controlled land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission Against Corruption) on Friday expanded its investigation into whether Obeid had influenced various state ministers to extend lease agreements at Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café, without tendering after their expiry in August 2005.
Now it is determined that Tripodi knew of Obeid’s hidden interest in the plots after Tripodi’s former deputy chief of staff Lynne Ashpole announced on Thursday.
In years of talks that began in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for leases.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer maturities.
In 2009, leases were extended for the Circular Quay companies, which raised $2.5 million a year for the Obaids, without public tenders.
Tripodi, who served as Port Minister from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally spoken out for public tenders.
But he refuses to have made the changes at the request of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had pushed for a reshaping of the government’s lease arrangements.
A telephone caption presented by the ICAC showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the port ministry after working under Obeid in the fisheries authority.
“Was the topic discussed in these telephone conversations the elaboration of the commercial lease arrangements?” asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Wheaty Tripodi.
“No,” Tripodi replied.
I can’t remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn’t.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli fighter jets attack targets in Syria, according to official sources
Israeli fighter jets attacked a target in Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior government official told Fox News.
The officer did not explain what the goal was, but said it was at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has already carried out air strikes on rocket deliveries in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to ‘truth test’
The government is considering an “authenticity test” for foreign workers with a 457 visa as part of extended measures.
If the test is introduced, it will be used on a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to occupy unskilled jobs or as a back door for moving family and friends to Australia.
Today, a government discussion proposal was published after former Labor Party MP Maxine McKew condemned the government’s comments regarding foreign workers because they could be perceived as insulting by Australia’s neighbors.
“Sound-to-sound statements like ‘foreigners should be at the back’ and ‘Australians should be at the back’ are a very unpleasant setback in times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market,” she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region take an echo of this historical artifact, I wouldn’t be surprised.
The discussion proposal outlines twelve measures that were once envisaged by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday to talk about human smuggling, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still being considered.
If the “Realty criterion” is adopted, then a person applying for a visa could be checked to see if “the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related or personally related to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting undertaking.”
Companies could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders, after in the past companies that initially only wanted to support a small number of workers eventually hired hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker probably died of a heart attack after arriving on Christmas Island this week with a refugee boat.
The troubled nine-year-old son of the man who came with him to Australia has been cared for by an adult cousin who was also on the boat since his father's death on Wednesday.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The UK government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
HS2 Ltd’s work proposes to implement high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England as early as Phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project “will bring Britain closer together.”
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was delighted to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
After completion of Phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The UK government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a trip time of ultimately three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our target for HS2 is a truly national network of routes that brings Britain and its cities closer together.”
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to work “indisputably” for Scottish involvement in the HS2 network.
Brown said: “The high-speed rail link holds the potential for enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time the economic power of Scotland also provides an argument for fast rail links across the UK.”
That is why we are pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to explore the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland that creates benefits for everyone and complements the Glasgow-Edinburgh link that the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the investigative report with the British ministers next year and to taking the next steps together.
Regulations on electronic devices in aircraft remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian air passengers must continue to switch off tablets and smartphones at take-off and landing, despite efforts in the US to loosen regulations on such devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows U.S. airlines to change their requirements so that passengers on their devices can read, watch or play e-books during critical flight phases, provided they are in flight mode.
During most of the flight, passengers are already allowed to do so, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books when starting and landing.
Australian companies are observing the decision that U.S. airlines have to do a lot of work to implement it, but are not pursuing any immediate plans to change their regulations.
The air traffic control agency CASA also stated that the announcement would be considered, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases in Australia still apply.
“The CASA currently has no specific rules regarding the use of electronic devices on the aircraft,” it said.
The issue is subject to provisions that airlines maintain safety at all times and passengers must follow the safety instructions given by cabin crew.
Virgin has already held talks with CASA about an expansion of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights, stating that it is open to change, but it would have to be initiated by the legislator.
“We would welcome a review of the CASA’s approval of electronic devices, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight,” a spokesperson said.
Qantas said it will remain in the current regulations until further notice.
“Our current guidelines foresee that electronic devices may not be used at launch and landing, and we currently have no plans to change that,” the company said.
The FAA regulations apply to U.S. airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that passengers can benefit from, and will certainly take a close look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision has a different impact on U.S. companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They need to prove that their aircraft can tolerate wireless interference from mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs, and customer instruction.
“After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lighter electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers, and smartphones at any height,” the FAA said in a statement.
In rare cases with poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off the equipment during the landing.
The group also recommended that heavier devices be safely stored under the seat or in the compartments above the seats during take-off and landing.
Before the Revierderby against Schalke, BVB trailers with light rockets had provided ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced tough consequences.
Before the Friday match of the Bundesliga against VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras reacted with a silence - initially.
It was an unusual, almost spooky acoustic that offered itself to the viewer until shortly before the start of the Bundesliga match between German vice-champion Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart in Signal Iduna Park.
Most of the guests were heard with their songs.
The South Tribune, on the other hand, where the most loyal of the loyal - and loudest - BVB fans are, initially presented itself exceptionally quietly: no chants, no shouts of battle.
The pedestal of the Capo, which otherwise coordinates the joint arousal, remained unoccupied.
And at the very front of the stand, a large banner with the inscription "Section Stadionverband".
Only as goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller as always became the first BVB player to enter the place, short-term cheers flared up.
When his teammates followed, there was loud singing and waving scarves – but not everywhere.
There was nothing in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Tribune.
Even the fact that stadium spokesman Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of the last days - Derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract extension of coach Jürgen Klopp - did not give rise to celebrations.
Only five minutes before the start, the Capo climbed his podium - and the tension, which had been tangible until then, was unleashed in a loud cry when Dickel, as usual, questioned the mood on the ranks of the stadium.
Finally, as always, the South Tribune was on its way – and finally, as usual, the loudest place in the stadium was here again.
And at the latest when the loud call "Derby winner gets up" came with a start from the South Tribune, everything was again as always.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past few days.
Immediately before Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the BVB supporters had fired light rockets into the spectator ranks and onto the pitch – almost hitting goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was tapped late due to the chaotic scenes.
BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had then received the tops of the Dortmund Ultras in his office - and if you believe Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable date for the fans.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra-movement," the BVB boss announced on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke prohibited the Ultras from performing a choreography for the home game against VfB Stuttgart.
“I’ve banned that,” he said.
We cannot give up the zero-tolerance policy on pyrotechnics.
In addition, the Ultras have been shown various options for punishment - until Tuesday they now have time to decide for one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, the BVB will impose a sanction by the end of next week.
"This is going to be cutting," Watzke assured.
You may be curious how the reactions in the South Tribune will turn out.
Pfandh<0xC3><0xA4>user booms in Singapore as the crisis has arrived in the middle class
In a pawn shop in Singapore’s Bendemeer shopping centre, Janani Amirthalinga swaps a gold bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay for her daughters’ school fees.
“My husband and I just bought a house, there’s all my money in it,” says Amirthalinga.
Although they earn 3,000 Singapore dollars each month (about 1,730 euros) as an administrative employee and their husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she explains.
In fact, demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – is so high that ValueMax, where it made its exchange, became the third pawnhouse listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Pending jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – $1,300 in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, pawn houses in Singapore require an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, which is just under the 15.4 percent that United Overseas Bank requires, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, pawn houses offer the advantage that there is no need to verify creditworthiness or proof of income, which is why loans are possible faster than with banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region turn to pawn houses after families feel the pressure from rising living costs as well as increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a loose financial policy in developed economies, families with lower and middle incomes are looking for pawn houses to compensate for the difference in stuttering economies.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor’s growing household debt, mainly due to rising mortgages, described it as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore are estimated to have the highest household debt in Asia relative to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which has just come out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing export weakness and a slowdown in consumer demand.
“In the end, this means that given rising costs, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible,” said Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical peaks in gold prices over the past two years have further reinforced the trend towards pledgeing personal items, as people are taking the opportunity to turn family jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged items are gold in the city-state’s 200 pawn houses.
People say, “The gold price looks good, let’s pledge Grandma’s gold chain and get back next month.”
The largest Thai pawn shop operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20 percent increase in its stores over the past few months.
The growth in the pawn business is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only into neighboring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company finances it with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars it received this week with the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some lenders have come to the crossfire for high interest rates, Yeah explains that pawnshops not only fined lower interest rates than other lenders, but also did not directly raise the debt.
“Customers do not borrow items they already own, and liquefying personal valuables does not increase household training,” she explains.
The mortgage lending business is increasingly accepted as short-term, secured financing.
Also, not all people who use mortgages are in financial trouble.
Rich people from Singapore also come to ValueMax’s stores to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers from all walks of life come to us.
“These include wealthy people who borrow something for a business or an investment in the short term, or small businesses that need to bridge bottlenecks in the cash flow,” says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA sucks off data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The intelligence revealer Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany clarify the ever-brisking NSA spying affair.
After the presentation of the Green Bundestag member Hans-Christian Ströbele, his surprise meeting with Snowden in Russia was about what conditions the ex-secret service staff would state in a German prosecutor’s office or in front of an investigative committee.
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele told ARD magazine "Panorama".
325 million Australian dollars bailout for Tasmanian healthcare
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions associated with the rescue package of over $325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health care to ensure that the state government cannot waste the money.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take “immediate measures” to avert a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and system restrictions.
The funding for a four-year period was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has put together an emergency rescue package that we believe addresses the unique challenges facing the state,” Plibersek said.
The $325 million package includes $31 million emergency aid for election services.
A further 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic procedures and treatments for grey star, are designed to eliminate residues.
In addition, there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare after inpatient stays, specialist training, mental health services, and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
“These investments are in line with the ideas that I have been told by affected clinicians that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health care system,” said Tanya Plibersek.
The minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability obligation of the Tasmanian government.
The state must maintain the current level of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth, and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member commission is set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie explained today, the $325 million would only be of little use if “they are not accompanied by real reforms that put the public Tasmanian health system on a more sustainable course.”
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent help, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the state’s public health system from the list of concerns,” Wilkie said.
According to the government of the state, these electoral benefits will largely make up for the recent cuts.
But the opposition’s health policy spokesman at the federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that today’s announcement is just a “plant solution.”
“We are in the current situation because the Labor government has withdrawn $430 million from the health care system,” he told ABC TV.
It cannot be that a government rips almost half a billion dollars out of the system and puts the Commonwealth 300 million in and then pretends to be the good news.
Dutton urged Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout package will be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux' adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but is also heavier than necessary.
The plot, set in France in the 1760s, tells the gripping story of Suzanne, a young noble who is sent by her family to the monastery.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superior and becomes the object of erotic fascination of another.
The film never slides off into lust or sensation – and that’s where its problem lies.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told also makes it a painful fine shirt for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons, according to a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed important chemical weapons and gypsy gas munitions manufacturing facilities, the global chemical weapons monitoring group said on Thursday, while serious clashes occurred in the north of the country near one of the sites where suspected toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the start of the civil war three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came a day before the date on which the
November 1st, set by the The Hague-based Damascus Organization to destroy or render “inoperable” all facilities for the production of chemical weapons, including all machines for the mixing of chemicals into poison gas and the filling of ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all Syria’s chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus must, however, begin to destroy the existing weapons and supplies.
According to estimates, there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and the nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting took place in the city of Safira on Thursday, experts say there is a production facility for chemical weapons and deposits here, as the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
The activist group, which tracks the death toll through a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the side of the government, 29,954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead are 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the number of dead in this conflict to be 100,000 since March 2011.
This number has not been updated yet.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad’s troops have been fighting in Safira for weeks against the rebels, many of whom have ties to al-Qaeda groups.
The Observatory said there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not mention any details.
The fighting underscores the danger facing the chemical weapons inspectors, as their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic weapons arsenal is a race against time in the midst of a raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which is working closely with the United Nations, the team is “now convinced that it has seen all the important production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned by Syria and has witnessed their destruction.”
Therefore, "no further inspection activities are currently planned."
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed the first round of inspections and visited 21 out of 23 of Damascus’ designated sites.
Due to security concerns, the visit of two facilities was not possible, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC stated that the two sites had been “given up ... and the objects of the chemical weapons program there had been moved to other said facilities that were inspected.”
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
“I take the hat off to the bravery and courage you have all shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization,” Ahmed Uzumcu, the director general of the monitoring organization, said in a statement published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels in this civil war have been fighting Assad’s government and its security forces, many of which are members of the Alawites, a division of Shi’ite Islam.
In view of further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said there had been a strong explosion in an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia on Wednesday.
The cause of the explosion was unknown, he explained.
Angry about judgment for Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the Bali bombing in 2002 reacted indignantly about the verdict for the last of the instigators brought to trial, as Umar Patek believed it was to be shot to death.
Patek, who has been on the run for almost ten years as one of the most wanted people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in building explosives for the bombing.
He could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for attacking two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many others were injured.
A statement of guilt was also made in a series of terrorist-related charges, including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutor’s office had demanded a life sentence, even if it could have applied for the death penalty for the man, who is also known as the “Demolition Man” because of his reputation as a master bomb maker.
The decision sparked painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his co-conspirators nearly ten years ago.
Fighting with tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
“You should put him in front of a firing squad,” Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day with the fact that I will not have another grandson and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was razed to the ground when on October 12, 2002, shortly after 11 p.m., a huge bomb exploded in a small truck parked in front of the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar, where just 20 seconds earlier, a suicide bomber exploded a backpack filled with explosives.
He fell into a coma for a month after the attack and died three times while hanging on a life-support system.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the massacre and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty in front of everyone else.
To let him live—no, there’s no reason to let him live.
Getting 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to stand trial.
He escaped nearly a decade of arrest, but was eventually picked up in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden almost four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said intelligence reports had provided the clue that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of re-establishing the connection between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
“He didn’t stand up,” Corteen said.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for how much suffering he has inflicted on other people.
The verdict was made before the 10-year anniversary of the attack this year, which is being held with commemorations in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” Corteen said.
Patek may appeal against his judgment.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in airplanes (but do not have cell phone calls)
Passengers can now listen to their electronic devices for reading, working, playing, music and watching movies from departure to landing, but not by phone, according to the new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States on Thursday.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented depended on the respective airline, FAA employee Michael Huerta explained at a press conference.
Airlines must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the flight crew training manuals as well as the equipment storage regulations in accordance with the new regulations.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
“We could very soon approve the extended use of electronic devices depending on the state of the plan,” the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers need to turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They can only start again when the plane has reached a height of three kilometers and gives the captain the green light.
When entering the landing, passengers must switch them off again and not restart them before the plane has landed.
According to the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the devices even at take-off, landing and on the runway, the FAA said.
Most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft converted for the use of Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Professional Flight Attendant Association, welcomed the changes.
“If the new regulation is implemented safely – and we work closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit from it,” Glading said.
To be honest, we are sorry to have to feel like guardians on this issue.
Nevertheless, Internet connections for browsing, exchanging emails, text messages or downloading data less than three kilometers remained prohibited, the agency explained.
Passengers are asked to put smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still no "Words With Friends", the Scrabble-like online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he publicly had to leave a jet of American Airlines because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked on the flight path.
And heavier devices such as laptops still need to be stowed, as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.
Phone calls during the flight are also prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices at launch and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, security expert for national traffic issues on CBS News, said mobile phones would still be considered risk.
“Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause interference with navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that air transmission can also interfere with transmission masts,” Rosenker said.
A industry advisory committee launched by the FAA to investigate this issue recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, the pressure on the FAA has increased to loosen restrictions on use.
Critics such as Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri argue that there are no valid security grounds for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
In some studies, it is said that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the shutdown of the device.
In 1966, the FAA began to restrict the use of electronic devices by air travellers after reports of disruptions to navigation and communication devices by passenger-carried FM radios became known, which at the time represented the latest technology trend.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA so that electronic interferences do not matter to them.
Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi to passengers for several years when the altitude is reached.
The aircraft adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for greater use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today’s electronic devices generally emit far less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, emit only minimal radiation when flipped.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are stronger.
Among the proponents of easing restrictions on the use of devices by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, company employees loaded a passenger plane full of Kindle e-readers and made a test flight to detect problems but could not detect them.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings regarding the risk of using devices.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believes the disruption to the equipment is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said there are only occasional reports of pilots speaking for a malfunction of aircraft systems through the devices, and most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to arrange for the switch-off of the devices by passengers in poor visibility when instrument landing.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adjustment for travelers who today would be extensively equipped with technology.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not contrary to safety,” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Rescued bird rescued by air rescue service from North Sea island
A bird flown to the coast by air rescue service, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea drilling island, was released back into nature.
The water slide was flown to Aberdeen last month with a helicopter, where it was docked by the Scottish animal welfare organization SPCA in their rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the centre, said: “This water rattle was probably a wintery migratory bird from northern Europe that was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea.”
Apparently, the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling island.
He added: “He couldn’t continue flying, which is why we were contacted with the request for help.”
Upon her release, the water rattle was again fit and healthy.
Is Europe’s elite ready to do business with the UK?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those in the UK want to change about our relations with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business executives, who represent UK business sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernizing and growing while the states in the EU are stagnating.
They want government-side new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil to be favored, instead of stopping the long and strenuous process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
In their opinion on certain legally regulated issues – from antitrust law to product legislation – the majority of business leaders believe that control of these key competencies should be brought back to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the internal market, as according to the companies, the costs of the Brussels regulations would now outweigh the advantages of being part of Europe’s trading zone – even 40 percent of large companies agreed to the one that is traditionally the most European-friendly.
Finally, and this probably says the most, our survey of business leaders found that a clear majority of Britain wants a course towards changing the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This finding, found among companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for a “sensuous change” that brings the booklet of action back to the UK.
It’s a lot of work – changing the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a 16 percent change of opinion in favour of staying in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan for the renegotiation of British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power back to the UK from a renegotiation.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone moves towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows, what a stronger focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation means for companies.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gas era
The construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of the largest European energy projects, the Gazprom board said.
“Today’s event is a milestone: construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun,” Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said in a statement.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream aims to increase the diversity of Russia’s export routes through Europe.
A treaty dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, in which most of the Russian gas is stored for Europe, provides for an increased risk in conventional routes, as can be heard from the official site.
Miller said the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were “forever” eliminated.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project goes into operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other downstream countries is expected to begin on the planned route at the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
For national and international investors, there is no way past the real estate location Germany.
The economic framework data are correct, and the financing options are excellent.
This has been the tenor of the 9th real estate day of the stock exchange newspaper.
German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the European comparison of good economic conditions in the country.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO Europe, Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, pointed this out on the 9th Real Estate Day of the stock exchange newspaper.
As wanted German commercial properties are, the look at the transaction volume, according to Ulbrich.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the prior-year period.
In the UK, the increase was only 6%, in France 19%.
“Real estate investments offer attractive interest rates,” Ulbrich said.
The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds is at a historically high level.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees charged with allegations against Jonathan Lord of sexual offences
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) were charged with child sexual offences before allegations were made against child care provider Jonathan Lord from Caringbah in 2011, as the Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse learned.
However, in the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA stated that it had “never been involved in an incident of sexual child abuse in the organization.”
Chief executive Phillip Hare was questioned about a case in which one YMCA employee had been charged with child pornography offences, and another in which a sports teacher at YMCA Caringbah Hall had been convicted of abuse of children entrusted to him in 1991.
Hare told Gail Furness, a lawyer assisting the Commission, that he knew of the first case, but did not know the second.
He admitted that the opening statement of the YMCA to the Commission was also inaccurate in the claim that "there have been external reviews of the YMCA, in which the YMCA has been recognised as at the forefront of child safety".
Instead, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA has been informed that it has received the second-lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities in August of the year.
Hare, who started at the YMCA at 21, admitted that the management had failed “from me down” in Lord’s appointment and did not ensure that employees had been aware of their obligations to report violations of the Child Safety Guidelines.
Lord was convicted at the beginning of the year of sexual misconduct on twelve boys during his two-year tenure at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare argues, however, that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lord’s violations regarding the safety of children.
The staff said they had observed violations, including that Lord was alone with children, privately cared for them as a babysitter, had them sit on his lap, told one that he loved it, and had children play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose superior was Lord and who had asked for a child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior, stated that the child service director Jacqui Barnat, who was Lord’s superior at YMCA Caringbah, “was very intimidating and most of the time very unimaginable.”
The Managing Director stated that he would not accept statements from employees that they did not dare to report to their superiors.
Instead, he said, rather, their friendship with Lord had impaired their judgment, which is why they had not reported him.
Hare stated that he had informed the Executive Board of YMCA NSW of his view that the lesson the organization had to draw from the “Jonathan Lord Incident” was “not about reporting” by employees, and the Executive Board had agreed to him.
Hare said the decision to urge employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the allegations appeared had been made by the managing director of YMCA’s child services, Liam Whitley.
He said it was intended to prevent contamination of the evidence, but this had been “over-resilient” and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a safe organization for children between 2009 and 2011, said Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert on sexual child abuse, to the Commission.
He explained that there had been “serious problems” in hiring, reviewing, hiring, training and supervising employees.
The hearing was postponed until December 20.
Tony Blair said he would take the opportunity to return as British prime minister, but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview tonight on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his retirement from office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic policy issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics, and his comments mostly limited to foreign policy and his role as ambassador to the Quartet of Peacemakers in the Middle East.
When asked if he would like to return to the prime minister’s office, Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard from London as saying, “Yes, sure, but it’s unlikely that this will happen, so...”
When the horse show experts found themselves in crowds in Cardiff to select the horse of the year, they were aware that a fierce competition was imminent.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who are not even in kindergarten and only took his first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee ran loose through the three rounds and won the first prize – leaving behind 30 adult opponents.
The inseparable couple, both equally large, were praised for their appearance, behavior and style in the annual competition hosted by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
On his appearance in competition with men and women with elegant melons, he had his plate cap set up at a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony, which was well above his age.
And Toffee received top marks for his appearance and his personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and since then practiced every day with the Shetland pony.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, “Fenton and Toffee are a great team.”
They had to compete against the entire field and went off the pitch with Goldpokal and Rosette.
It was only the second time he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Perfect strangers in the arena considered him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been performing horses for over ten years.
Howells said: “The whole audience was like electrified and everyone was cheering and clapping him.”
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens to take care of.
The way he started, it won’t be long before he’s on the “horse of the year” show – and I’m sure he’ll cut well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said: “Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony.”
Together they are a great team.
The jurors evaluated Fenton and Toffee after how well they had beaten themselves and presented themselves in the demonstration ring.
They pay attention to good cooperation between Pony and Führer – and there Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's cute clothes contributed to her part, which really fit perfectly to the occasion.
Chinese newspaper to be “reformed” after call
A Chinese newspaper, which had called for the release of a reporter accused of defamation, was to be reformed, a press regulator said.
Guangzhou-based New Express had a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to fake reports about a state-owned company.
Now, the New Express will be subject to “comprehensive rectification,” the regulator said.
The "rectification order" was issued by the Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television Authority in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the New Express, which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several inaccurate reports about the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The editorial management of the New Express was disorderly,” the regulator said in a statement.
She said it had been decided to “punish an administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and deprive him of his reporter license.”
In addition, “the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to carry out a full rectification of the New Express and recommended that the relevant managers be identified with the New Express and immediately check the New Express leadership team.”
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported alleged financial irregularities at a manufacturer of construction machinery called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the cover page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment.
“In this case, I damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence,” he told CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was out on money and fame.
I realized that I acted wrongly.
Following Chen’s apology, the New Express released an apology on the front page and stated that it failed to properly review the reports.
Several well-known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say confessions are still routinely enforced, despite a law change early in the year that banned authorities from forcing anyone to blame themselves.
Drug tunnel discovered with its own railroad between the US and Mexico
One of the most refined tunnels for drug smuggling between the U.S. and Mexico, fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric rail operation, has now been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 120-by-90-centimeter tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they had ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in a zigzag pattern over a length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless inconspicuous warehouses in the area, making it easier to hide drug-laden trucks.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported undetected, authorities said.
In the discovery of the tunnel, eight-and-a-half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured, according to the court records.
Three men who, according to authorities, worked as drivers were charged with possession and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They face prison sentences of between 10 years and life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, which puts the drug cartels facing the challenge of how to quickly bring their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640-meter-long passage with rails that ran from a kitchen in a residential building in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Actors Orlando Bloom and model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future.
In an interview, Bloom said he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has voiced his separation from his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, who was scheduled to be aired on Friday (local time), Bloom said, “Life sometimes doesn’t go exactly as we plan or hope.”
Kerr and himself still loved each other, emphasised the 36-year-old.
"We will support each other and love each other as parents of Flynn".
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and in 2011 their son Flynn was born.
Veganism is, according to lexics, subject to vegetarianism, but differs from this in a very significant way.
Because while vegetarians allow themselves to eat creamy places, ice cream or a strong edam, these treats are not on a vegan’s menu.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to abstaining from meat and fish, the vegan abstains from all consumption of animal products - honey is also denied.
What remains, you may ask yourself, but when you look closer, the vegan world of nutrition is characterized by a considerable ingenuity.
“Bread spreads are very popular,” explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local reform house, which has a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in Domgasse.
For 13 years, the native New Zealander has been living vegan, in Lampertheim he finds (almost) everything he needs to live. "In 1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian".
At the turn of the century, the next step was taken and I became a vegan.
"The conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, who prefers leatherette to normal leather.
He realized that it is also possible in other everyday matters without animal products.
First and foremost, vegan is an ethics.
“I don’t want animals to have to die for me,” Proctor says, explaining the maxim of vegans, which extends to all consumer behavior.
Instead of following burgers, scrambled eggs or rubber bears, the vegan quickly discovered entirely new products, the enthusiasm increased.
“It’s a double bonus,” says Proctor today, “actually vegan doesn’t represent a renunciation, it’s an asceticism, but it’s an enrichment.” Assuming that with the food change you reduce the choice of food options, Proctor is more likely to lead back to the power of habit.
And precisely these conditionings also caused some even so well-intentioned attempts to fail.
“The addiction factor is a very crucial factor that allows many to give up quickly, much like smoking,” Proctor said.
He said, “There is no taste for the beast.”
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
“But you can also create the same effect in other ways,” the vegan explains.
For a barbecue, Proctor brings eggplants, mushrooms and also a few vegan sausages.
He pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it should also taste delicious once in a while.
Of course, you want something between your teeth, that’s legitimate.
"It should taste, but that's not just to reduce to animal food," Proctor said.
He did not suffer any health damage up to eating disorders, another widespread assumption.
For me, the transition had a positive aspect.
I do not take any foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who feed exclusively on vegans.
“My blood counts are good, I often let myself be checked,” Proctor reveals.
In particular, the lack of vitamin B12 warns many vegans.
“Since animals are fed with feed instead of grazing on pasture, it is questionable whether the vitamin B12 content is high in the meat you buy in the refrigerator,” says Proctor.
For vegans, it is also possible to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
“My B12 values are fine,” he explains.
Proctor does not have to go far for food procurement.
After all, there are staple foods everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
Everything I need, I find on site.
From time to time, I buy something special.
"Many people overlook the fact that just the finished products are expensive, but so is the case with "ordinary" finished products as well as known."
In any case, the preparation of vegan dishes is far cheaper and less time-consuming than commonly thought.
“There is a lot to discover in the home kitchen, with a few small knives you can achieve good, if not partially better, results,” says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of egg, with its vegan cheesecake Proctor was also able to surprise his in-laws.
Family parties give the vegan a new spice.
This has dynamics when you cook together, it has a new significance.
“The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves,” says Proctor.
Of course, skepticism has already been brought to him.
Don't you like my food anymore?
"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - on such questions one must act as a vegan with a sense of touch.
“I don’t reject people, I’m part of this society,” Proctor said.
And more precisely, the everyday world doesn’t seem as vegan as it is supposed – and the vegan doesn’t seem as restricted in everyday life as commonly assumed.
Fast food is also allowed.
Pommes are everywhere!
“Many doner shops offer falafel, or a vegetarian yufka,” says Proctor.
In a pizzeria, he avoids pasta dishes, or orders a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants are slowly getting on with it.
“When I started eating vegan 13 years ago, everything was even more difficult,” the New Zealander can find a development: “You have to talk to people, make them aware of it.”
“If enough requests come, they may be inclined to supplement the menu,” he hopes.
Vegan restaurants are developing, such as the kombüse in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor has the desire that other restaurants also have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they are just the opposite of exclusive.
“Fish dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others,” Proctor states.
“If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a sure way to make the biggest part of it impossible from the start,” says Proctor.
Buying vegan products can be a bit difficult at first.
Especially when one learns to understand that even peanuts can contain animal additives as a colouring agent, one seems to quickly abandon courage by following ethics with so many hurdles and traps.
Not only for this reason, Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: "Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and their Alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are added to food and cleaning products.
“After a while, you develop a scanner view and know which characters and logos you have to pay attention to,” says Proctor, “it is sometimes better to take small steps than to stop or stumble.”
Veganism, it is an important moral finger pointing to consciousness.
He may not be able to quite put down his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to critically question his habits.
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers in the air.
Trading on the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon by German time.
In a communication, the operator was responsible for technical problems.
The other eleven U.S. option markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger breakdowns at the stock exchange operator.
It was not until Tuesday that Nasdaq’s indices were not calculated for an hour due to data transport errors.
In August of this year alone, there had been two breakdowns in a week.
First, the U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent massively flawed purchase orders to the option markets due to technical problems.
The stock exchange operators then took almost a whole day to review and delete the orders.
Two days later, half of the entire stock trade in the U.S. came to a standstill for several hours due to a computer breakdown on the Nasdaq stock exchange.
In addition, Facebook’s IPO caused a stir last year.
The Nasdaq systems had not grown in the flood of purchase and sale orders, later established the SEC’s stock market supervisor, and squandered the company to a record fine of $10 million.
Konstanz: Radler turns 63-year-old
According to the police, the accident occurred when a 26-year-old man on Thursday evening, around 10 p.m., was riding a women's bicycle improperly on the left sidewalk from the station square towards the market place.
When suddenly a 63-year-old man stepped out of a local on the sidewalk, the cyclist could no longer brake in time, according to police.
In the following collision, the pedestrian was pushed against the house wall, went further down to the floor and pulled a 15 centimetre long place wound to his head.
An ambulance team took the injured person to the clinic for medical treatment.
British police issue extradition order to Assange
The British police today handed over an extradition order to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that the 40-year-old Australian had been issued an “invitation to stand up” to ask him to appear in a police station, and added that if he did not comply, the arrest threatened him.
Assange threatens extradition to Sweden because of the charges in a sexual offence after his options have been exhausted under British law since the Supreme Court rejected his opposition to extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would deliver him to the United States, he had sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum.
“Scotland Yard has issued a request to a 40-year-old man to appear at a police station at a time we chose,” a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the terms of his release on bail.
The embassy did not comment on the delivery of the police call.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States and charged there with possible espionage charges after publishing over 250,000 diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks disclosure website.
Driver, who had run at 210 km/h and hot drink between his legs, receives <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 penalty
A driver was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving at up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the drinking cup between his legs.
In front of the Colchester District Court, Howie pleaded guilty without having taken the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also sentenced to pay costs of <0xC2><0xA3>90 as well as a <0xC2><0xA3>100 victim fee.
Tax for foreign property owners against London’s bubble of speculation
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still waiting for the final decision of Chancellor George Osborne, who had imposed a stamp tax of 7% in the 2012 budget on apartments costing over <0xC2><0xA3>2 million, as well as annual fees for buyers who hold apartments as a company and not as individuals.
Already now, income from the stamp tax on residential property in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts, which amounted to <0xC2><0xA3>708 million in the 2012/13 tax year, has combined revenues for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, North West, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cook said: “After the increases in stamp tax on high-priced apartments and the introduction of related legislation against circumvention, one can hardly claim that high-quality properties are too low-taxed, regardless of the impact of the outdated community tax system.”
“However, this step could make some foreign investors more cautious about buying property in London, or stop owners from selling it,” he added.
First-class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in the wealthy London Southwest Belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has earned a record 11.8% last year.
Prices in Central London showed an even annual growth rate of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an emerging “domestic market” where the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, Savills said.
Scientists were able to shed more light on the relationship between a dog’s tailweaving and his mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with the tail were more to the right (from the dog’s point of view), while in nervous dogs it was the left side.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and react to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: “In humans, it is well known that the left and right hemispheres of the brain respond differently to stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions.”
Here we tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just as in humans, the right half of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
To learn more about how dogs respond to the lateral tailweeds of their peers, the researchers monitored the animals while watching these films of other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four-legged and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we will soon understand why the cock moves in one direction, sometimes in the other
Professor Vallortigara said: “We have shown the dogs films with dogs – either a true-to-life version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right.”
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressionless dog moved the tail to the right (from the perspective of the whirling dog seen), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the inclination of the tail was mainly to the left (again from the perspective of the dog, who wobbles), their heart rate rose and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience what movements they should be concerned about and when not.
He said: “If you have different encounters with other dogs and the swinging with the tail in one direction is more associated with friendly behavior and the right side produces a less friendly behavior, then you react based on these experiences.”
The researchers say the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians, and trainers better understand their animal’s emotions.
John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behavior and guest scholar at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Bristol, said this was not the first study to investigate whether left and right are important for dogs.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when it’s a satisfied dog.
Another research at the University of Victoria in Canada stated: “Dogs are more likely to approach a robot dog if his ‘tail’ is to the left and not to the right, rather than to become restless – just the other way around than in the Italian study.”
According to his statement, the differences could therefore be due to the fact that in the various studies the dogs did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study on how dogs respond to real dogs could help, he explained.
“There is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for different purposes, but many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception,” Bradshaw said.
But since their behavior is easy to record, it probably won’t take long for us to understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone appearance in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's disease
The rock band Arctic Monkeys has postponed an appearance in Glasgow after their lead singer is ill with throat inflammation.
The band from Sheffield was scheduled to play in Hydro on Friday.
However, due to the illness of lead singer Alex Turner, the concert must now be postponed.
The band’s announcement came after she had previously had to postpone a performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: “After the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and at medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1st.”
“Alex Turner has been diagnosed with a larynx, which is why he unfortunately can’t appear.”
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on 20 November, which was moved to Hydro in Glasgow on 21 November.
All tickets remain valid for these shows.
We apologize to all ticket holders for the inconvenience caused by this.
Please contact customer service at the points of sale where you purchased your ticket if you need further assistance.
Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will call for the first time new cardinals of the Catholic Church on February 22, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest-ranking clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they are also the ones who choose a pope, so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 can no longer participate in the election of the Pope – that is the case for a group of 120 “electoral cardinals”.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said there would be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony to appoint the new cardinals, also known as the Consistory, was held.
“Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the Consistory in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from around the world can be planned,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of eligible cardinals is likely to drop by February.
He explained that a pope usually appoints as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of eligible cardinals again amounts to 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he wants.
The consistory next year is significant because it is the first since the election of Francis in March this year, Valero said.
There is currently a certain overhang on the part of Europe and especially Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the Council of Cardinals, founded by Francis, to find a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who are tasked with finding opportunities to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
“Now, Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He explained that it was “well possible” that Francis asked the cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been in this position – this is all completely new.
Valero said that the bishops would typically be called cardinals from large places, but Pope Francis was “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he is appointing.”
GM calls back new pickup trucks in the U.S. to repair the seat backrest
General Motors recalls nearly 19,000 of its all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks to address a problem with the manually adjustable seat back, according to a statement released by the U.S. Vehicle Safety Regulatory Authority on Friday.
For some of the cars, there may be a defect in the mechanism for resetting the front seat backrest.
For this reason, they do not comply with the Federal guidelines for vehicle safety for head restraints.
“If the vehicle is hit from behind, it’s possible that the headrest doesn’t properly protect the occupants, so there’s an increased risk of injury,” read the news on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s (NHTSA) website.
The recalled models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September.
The delivery of GM trucks began in June and represents the main model launch of the leading U.S. automaker since the insolvency-related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners about the defect in the first half of October.
The NHTSA was unable to check the notification letter due to the 16-day government shutdown, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were newly developed for the 2014 model year, increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
The GM share rose 1.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
The Desperation of an Obama Voter
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible
He says Obama has made commendable efforts that have been thwarted by Republican blockade tactics
The blockade policy does not excuse the website problems of Obamacare, the drone attacks
Obama’s memoirs about the 2008 election campaign are a sad reminder of what would have been possible.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a very sad book.
It’s a book that I believed would cheer me up during the gloomy second year of my medical studies and give me hope again.
It’s called “The Audacity to Win” and describes Barack Obama’s memoirs for the 2008 presidential election.
When I’m done with my patient’s notes in the evening and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and could take a breath out of a speech.
The election became a landslide victory and news spokesmen stopped to face the historic significance of this hour.
My classmates were crying with joy and my parents were collecting all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries were on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama moved to office in 2008, he had approval ratings of 82%.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is an evil awakening, as if being snatched from a dream.
It’s hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague reminder, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I first gave my vote, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and multifaceted things that Obama has achieved, from the passing of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I, too, believe that the party-political blockade tactic has tipped too many efforts to move our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance, and closing Guantanamo Bay, to name but a few.
But after defending the Obama administration to colleagues and acquaintances countless times, I came to the end with my explanatory efforts.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why it allows the interception of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.
It can’t explain why the National Security Agency collects data about Americans’ private lives and why whistleblowers are being punished who expose state misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why public funding and spending limits are bypassed during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report stating that the White House’s efforts to quiet the media are the “most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration.”
And most recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the passing of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood at the age of 18 that government work could contradict the previous political campaigns.
Obviously, the parliamentary office is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre shape the public discussion.
But when I look at the examples above, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unchallenged alternative, he seemed unable to set his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hope we had heard of for so long.
But with the fall in Obama’s approval ratings to less than 45% this week, the return to 2008 has become all the harder through this book.
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have dissolved in air.
This week, I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to put in a heavy loss against Clinton in the Pennsylvania primaries.
In a meeting with the electoral assistants after the decision, he told his employees that they would have to come back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.
“I want us to find our magic again,” he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree more strongly with you.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer Claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott Has Conflict of Interest on Parental Leave
Billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters are getting pregnant and could therefore benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who is in a court dispute over the payment of $6 million in CO2 taxes, made the claim when he wanted to wipe out questions about whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which is important for deciding whether CO2 and mining taxes will be cancelled or cut.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and Abbott’s daughters would personally benefit from the laws.
“He is in a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters gets pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she gets a vacation,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Palmer Electoral Commission officially declared the winner of Fairfax’s Sunshine Coast seat with 53 votes ahead of the re-election.
Palmer called for a revision of the voting process so that it would go faster.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of voting?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why should we not have a system where you march in, enter the data into a computer, immediately select and then have the result at 6:30 in the evening?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the ballots.
Do you use them because you can erase the results if you don’t like them?
Matching with pencils these days is incredible.
The Electoral Commission has reviewed the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, stated that his policies include an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he will take his new office “very seriously.”
A public office is about public service.
“We do not seek any reward except that of history, namely that we can serve in a critical time of this community,” he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange division, so two people familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the global government investigation into the alleged manipulations in the currency market is rapidly taking off.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, and RBS, confirmed that they are working with authorities to investigate the world’s largest financial market, where $5.3 billion is exchanged daily by the owner.
The two dealers would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation that is causing the scandal surrounding the Libor interbank business.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received information requests from authorities.
“Our investigations on this issue continue and we fully cooperate with the FCA and other regulators,” the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, related individuals stated that RBS had forwarded the records of emails and instant messages sent by and to a former trader to the UK regulatory authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left RBS in 2010 and is now said to have been left on leave from his current position as European head of Forex spot trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, was on leave this week and Matt Gardiner, former leading currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these traders were accused of any wrongdoing.
Bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup were part of Usher’s Instant Message group, people close to the situation said.
UBS announced this week that it has taken steps against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma announced that it is investigating a suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently investigating allegations that bankers have agreed on transactions in the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said familiar with the situation.
Banks comb through instant messages and emails from several years in search of cases of misconduct.
The news about these investigations has put traders in turmoil in an area that has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years, but this year was under pressure because low volatility in currencies limits the chances for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair and said it was almost impossible to manipulate the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
A leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trading, fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of its own internal platforms by banks lead to “one can influence the market with very low ticket prices”.
The news came out on the same day Credit Suisse announced that she had cancelled a dealer of her London Exchange Traded Funds office this week after causing a loss of nearly six million dollars at the end of last year.
The bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperates with them.
“We are sure that the trader has acted alone and that the matter is contained,” Credit Suisse said.
Painted the building fence on the Bechtle plot
A group of citizens' initiative "Schweizer Wiese" has beautified the building fence on the Bechtle site on the Kurpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, it cleaned and broadened the footpath, according to a press release.
The planned covering of the decaying house in the rear of the property had not been allowed for safety reasons, because the site is threatening to slip.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had cancelled the beautification campaign with his colleague Reinhard Domke from BI.
Prior to BI’s action, a transparent message with the message “We are for it” had been attached.
However, this did not bother the approximately 20 members of the citizens’ initiative very much in their action.
Her motto on the big poster was "We are against ruins".
In doing so, she wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - should the giant project one day fail.
In conversation with many passers-by in front of the "building site" it became clear that some citizens believe that many will be better off with the realization of the project of the city, although few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they are starting to resign because the city is delaying these answers further, the BI said.
As was heard, the mayor’s public statements also have an effect.
May had said at the municipal council meeting that he feared the out for the thermal bath should the population vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow during the citizens' decision.
Some appear to be quite frightened by this, while others feel that they are a "plump of extortion" on the population, the BI press release said.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Rangnick sign for Schiris: Mane no swallow king
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg, the sports director of the "bulls" was disappointed by the referees.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category of swallow kings," he said at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday.
The most recent occasion for Rangnick's criticism was Yellow for Mane at 3-0 against Grödig last Sunday, in which Senegalese became an alleged actress - which, of course, was none, as the TV pictures showed.
"A harsh mistake," said Rangnick, who referred to referee Harkam as "totally overburdened."
Harkam would also have contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig coach Adi Hütter after the match.
He defended his German compatriot decisively: "I would have behaved in every single situation the same as Roger Schmidt".
Schmidt himself does not want to have had contact with his colleague after the Scharmützel with Hütter.
I don't know why.
“For I am the one who was insulted,” the 46-year-old said.
However, in the face of the success, Rangnick agreed to a praise anthem.
“There are only two words for this: really good,” he stated.
There's not much to expose.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
This is supposed to go on like this.
There will be hardly any changes to the framework in the winter transfer period.
There are no great reasons to change anything.
"Except for a player to step in with the desire to leave the club," Rangnick said.
Supreme Court Confirms Obama's Health Law
It is a great victory for the Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
By five to four votes, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – forcing U.S. citizens to take out health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional within the scope of the state’s tax authority.
The Supreme Judge John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while the Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy voted against it.
The court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2,700-page law and also held the view that the provision of the Health Act that states would either have to extend the access requirements for Medicaid or otherwise remove all state Medicaid subsidies would not be unconstitutional.
The lawsuit against the law was brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law had been firmly rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including eventual challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 pre-election campaign.
Norway: Norwegian place gets light with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light to their dark valley.
Due to the low degree of sunlight, the Rjukan, located in the Vestfjord valley, usually sinks in the shade of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring.
With three giant reflectors at a height of 45 meters, a dream of the century came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!" said Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the start ceremony on TV2.
Some of the people in the valley turned to sun loungers, while others put on sunglasses for safety.
So far, sun-hungry people had to ride a cable car to a nearby peak in winter.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen had presented the proposal to steer the rays with mirrors into the valley.
However, this basic idea has existed in the town since 1913.
After several years of debate, the city council had finally approved the 5 million kroner (around 615 000 euros) expensive project.
A similar construction has provided winter sunshine to the Italian Alpine resort of Viganella for several years.
Post barely learns on Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed yet, the red dots for the Sunday empties are still on different mailboxes of the core city and the districts, but if you read the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG, you quickly find out that the empties no longer take place on Sundays and public holidays," the FDP said.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and public holidays only in front of the post office building in Ernst-Ludwig-Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e 36 and Jakob-Müller-Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e 1 in Hüttenfeld.
Whether in Hofheim and Rosengarten will also be emptied on Sunday will not be answered in the answer to the FDP’s request.
The FDP’s social and youth policy spokesman, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to look into this.
The Sunday lesson is an important postal service especially at the time of appointment post.
"This thins out this undertaking despite the price increase for letters on January 2013 radical and unreasonable".
Thomas Bittner, chairman of the Liberals’ political group and city council, supports his group colleagues: “What bothers me is the fact that the apprenticeships here are changed or even deleted.”
By the way, the post office is miles away.
"At least the mailboxes in the Neuschlo<0xC3><0x9F> and Rosengarten districts have to be emptied again on Sundays," says Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono.
Also valid for the core city, especially non-mobile citizens would have to be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday emptying on foot.
Röhrenbeck asked the city parliament if the city administration is planning talks with the post office on this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
However, his knowledge also has a Sunday lesson in Hofheim.
Your party has voted for privatization.
“Then decisions are made elsewhere,” Maier said.
Frankfurt parking fees are expected to rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more sensitive.
This morning, the city's magistrate will advise on a presentation by transport denier Stefan Majer (Green).
This means that parking fees will be increased by 50 percent.
For this, however, the prices should not be increased, but the time interval of parking clocks and parking ticket machines should be shortened from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the city council will have to decide.
The retail committee at IHK Frankfurt considers this "not a good idea".
The parking right in front of the store is “an advantage not to be underestimated for smaller retailers”.
The German Transport Club believes that an increase after two decades is "quite appropriate and actually long overdue".
Public transport is also becoming more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Quick Actions Overwhelming Hosts
With a narrow squad, the gentlemen I of the TSV Freudenstadt had to compete in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen of the Swabian Alb.
The Eagles were on the other side of the net with an experienced team.
Soon, however, it turned out that, even age-related, they could not quite keep up with the fast actions of the Freudenstadters.
With the hard and placed spreads, the Gönninger were extremely difficult.
Repeatedly, they missed the passes and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly over the network center and were not in place during the block defense.
Two high first sentence gains clearly expressed the superiority of the Freudenstadters in all matters.
In the face of this oppressive and game-determining performance, the third set was then won slightly lazily and lustlessly to the 3-0 finish (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
There will be a much more powerful opponent on the field on November 2 with the TV Baiersbronn, which was able to clearly prevail in Nagold.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik B<0xC3><0xA4>uerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix P<0xC3><0xA4>lchen, Stefan R<0xC3><0xA4>ller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced each other in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a fiercely competitive two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused errors and point gifts, especially in the acceptance of the ball; even in the passports, the precision was sometimes defective and in some critical play scenes, the <0xC3><0x9C>bereifer prevented the look for possible point gains.
However, in this highly balanced meeting, the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto consistently agreed on the great physical commitment and a pleasing commitment of both teams.
Care day at the small English hut
For the fifth day of care in the aftermath of the Natura 2000 project in Upper Hotzenwald, a group of committed participants met at the small English hut in Ibach.
Due to suggestions from the population, this day should be cut free in the area of the hut of the view into the valley, Mayor Helmut Kaiser said.
Many hikers, according to Kaiser, described this area as the splendour of the gorge path, on which the landscape provided the ideal setting for magnificent views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was a suitable instrument for strengthening the connection between man and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to set their own accents in nature.
At the same time as the tourist aspect, ecological considerations can also be taken into account.
Friederike Tribukait of the Department of Nature Conservation of the Freiburg Government Bureau explained this ecological aspect following the welcome by Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronage and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist destination of the far-view is covered with the aim of obtaining the now heavily grown old common pasture with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the still existing pastures.
Certain species such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
You need these free connections for art preservation.
Tribukait said she did not want to miss breaking a lance for the planned biosphere area at this point.
The current measure is not only seamlessly integrated into this planning.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognised Unesco status and thus a continuous addition to what has been achieved for the future with the Life project and the previous days of care.
According to these various explanations, district manager Christoph Wehle and life project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been beaten in advance, the forestry tractor may be ready to call.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of juniper bushes and the care of a dry stone bar.
The goal was the open view at the vantage point.
Löffingen: Köpfler still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although Baarst<0xC3><0xA4>dtchen Löffingen, with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a forward-looking school, children, youth and senior citizens policy, as well as its own municipal works, has not yet registered a second candidate for mayor.
As the only candidate to succeed Mayor Norbert Brugger, who is no longer a candidate for age reasons, the 46-year-old bank clerk and business owner Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen has so far been confirmed.
The application deadline expires on Monday, November 11, at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, on Thursday filed an avalanche of lawsuits for patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that was overruled by him in Nortel’s bankruptcy auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that purchased the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringements before the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases.
The patents concern technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, according to the lawsuit, which thus hits the core of Google’s search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately available.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture phones that work with Google’s Android operating system, which is in sharp competition with Apple and Microsoft’s mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of over $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google increased its offering several times and recently offered $4.4 billion.
After being overtaken by Rockstar’s Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola’s library of patents.
“Although Google has failed in its attempt to acquire the patent at the auction, Google has violated the patents and continues to do so,” the statement said.
Rockstar demands a high compensation from Google, as it claims that Google’s patent infringement is intentional, according to the allegation.
Egypt pledges first freely elected president
Mohammed Mursi takes the oath of office, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a “new Egypt” when he was sworn in as the first freely elected president of the country and thus took on the succession of Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt’s fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took the oath before the 18 black robes-clad judges of the court, whose seat is on the Nile River and is imitated by an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” Morsi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, a real democracy and stability,” said 60-year-old Mursi, a US-trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that had been targeted by the government since its founding 84 years ago.
Hundreds of soldiers and police were guarding the building when Morsi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after eleven o’clock local time.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in court to cheer on the new president, and unlike the presidential pomp of the Mubarak era, traffic was stopped only for a short time so that the auto convoy could cross the usually busy street that connects the city centre with the southern suburbs.
As an uncharismatic “replacement wheel” of the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those who wanted to bring the efforts of the 2011 uprising against authoritarian Mubarak to the goal.
“Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” Morsi, dressed in a blue suit with a red tie, told the judges in the wood-panelled chamber in which he took office.
Later, Morsi went to the University of Cairo where he was supposed to give his inaugural speech.
He was officially greeted by an army chapel, which played the national anthem, which he listened to in keeping position.
The military leader Feldmarschall Hussein Tantawi was present.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of attendees in the university's largest auditorium with voice-overs from "The Army and the People are a Hand".
Built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, the University of Cairo has developed into a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
On Friday, Mursi made a symbolic oath on Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that led to the end of Mubarak’s authoritarian rule last year, and he vowed to reclaim presidential powers that the military council had taken over from the head of state chased out of office.
But with the laying down of the official oath before the court and not as usual before the parliament, he bows to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
Mursi’s speech on Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberg Discothek makes for two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberg Discothek "Blue Velvet" has begun.
On Friday evening it is called "Pump this party", on Saturday evening it continues with an <0xC3><0x9C> 25 party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are, of course, promised by the organizers on both days.
Workers rushed off ladder: seriously injured
On Thursday, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg fell from a ladder and seriously injured himself.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a defective heating sensor on the exterior fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade of a inn.
As he climbed on the ladder leaning towards the gutter, it slipped away and the man fell on the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to the Salzburg State Hospital with the rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6".
South African rapist: twice life imprisonment
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to two life sentences on Friday.
This was reported by SABC.
The victim later died from the consequences of the serious injuries.
John Kana had already been found guilty at the beginning of the week of the crime.
The act had sparked outrage throughout the country.
The then 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February at an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
For 14 hours, doctors fought for the victim’s survival, but in vain.
The young people’s sight was so appalling that the nurses and sisters needed psychological help.
During the trial, Kana admitted to having been in a bar with Booysen on the night of the day.
He also confessed to having beaten and raped her, but he denied being responsible for the girl's death.
The police had initially assumed several perpetrators, but released two suspects from custody because the evidence against them was not sufficient.
The prosecutor also stressed during the trial that she was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
In South Africa, rape is almost part of everyday life: There are about 64,000 sexual violence ads a year.
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people it has significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women's associations in South Africa estimate the dark numbers in sexual violence to be 10 to 25 times.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo in search of the "best ham in the world": For the TV show "Galileo" visited the Pro7 star Bonndorf.
The speaker makes it clear at the beginning: The most important thing for the ham is the pig’s throats, Turbomast is not a good prerequisite.
Can ham that you get in any supermarket be a quality product?
As head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, Jumbo explains how the company "Adler" works in Bonndorf.
"Germany's dearest ham", as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
Only with hair protection and coat comes it inside the factory.
Jumbo also has to disinfect his hands before he is allowed to grab the micro.
Jumbo Faced for Strengthening at Quickimbiss in Waldshut
"Here I am working huge amounts," the TV makers, Black Forest ham as a mass product, marvel.
16,000 Colognes per week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, color: Uli explains what matters in terms of quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months.
TV with level?
Details such as the Ph-value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the pH.
"I'm looking forward to seeing what happens to Roberto Blanco," Jumbo said cynically.
Here the level of private television in pure culture is presented.
But watching is worth it anyway.
The spectator sees that the splitting of the keuls is still manual work.
Because: Black Forest ham is traditionally found without bones in the shelf.
The secret of the ham is the spice mixture with the salt.
Smoke tower and smoke firing remind Jumbo optically of a "submarine".
The trick: fir branches provide here in smoke the special taste of the black forest ham.
20 days in the smoke makes the ham almost black.
"Now the disc disappears in the jumbo," he announces the test feed.
"It's really delicious," said the TV star's conclusion.
This will allow all parties involved to live.
You thought travel agencies were part of the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be opposed to the trend.
The company has increased its earnings outlook for the full year and expects record revenues from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now expects adjusted annual profit before taxes between $325 and $340 million, compared to $305 to $315 million in its previous forecast.
When the current target values are reached, that means a 12 to 17 percent growth compared to the record profit of $290.4 million in the 2011/12 period.
As CEO Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre achieved 8% profit in the first half of the year and posted a strong start to the second half of the year, especially in the Australian and British private business.
“Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable and some of them are well on track to record annual income before interest and taxes,” he said.
These include Australia and the UK, which are typically among our strongest contributors.
In Australia, the leisure industry has recovered in the second half of the year, which balances a slightly weaker market for business travel.
Similarly, it worked well for the leisure business of Flight Centre in the UK, while the business customers also spend less.
The US business recovered compared to the seasonally weaker first half of the year, so a profit for the full year is expected for the third consecutive year.
Flight Centre shares rose 3 cents yesterday to $38.20.
Schools are being held to a greater focus on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In English Literature courses, students will have to deal with at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
The exam also includes “unseen texts” to encourage wider reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be abolished.
Starting in 2015, students will need to take an independent GCSE exam for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish the new curricula for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects that have been radically redesigned.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the Audit Authority, will announce a reorganisation of the GCSE structures, including a new grading system and less coursework.
In a speech this summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said that there is “a broad consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public trust,” emphasizing that the GCSEs would become “more challenging, more ambitious, and more rigorous.”
Studies show that in English schools, less time is spent on mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year – than in most other countries.
In contrast, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the timetable, coalition circles say that the comprehensive math exam – combined with a stronger emphasis on the subject in rankings – will probably encourage schools to hire more hours.
The curriculum focuses more on “problems from the right life”, including financial mathematics.
Beautiful animals and delicious pies attract
The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and colour strokes will present the circuit performance show this weekend at the Bürgerhaus.
The reviews were already made on Thursday
Again, the local association W514 organizes this large exhibition.
Breeders of the clubs in the district of Soest show their best animals as well as young Wickeder hobby holders their rabbits.
On Thursday, six judges made the evaluation of the numerous rabbits and were able to distinguish outstanding animals.
The visitors of the show are well informed, as the assessment of all animals is attached to the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition will take place on Saturday at 2.30 p.m. Mayor Hermann Arndt.
The rabbit show is open to all visitors on Saturdays from 10 am and on Sundays from 10 am to 3.30 pm, which is followed by the award ceremony.
Guests are also invited to a Tombola equipped with state-of-the-art prices and a deliciously stocked cafeteria.
Pamela Anderson separates herself from her legendary blonde curls and performs for the first time with a new bubi head.
Pamela’s blonde curls have been famous for their role in the TV series Baywatch.
Pamela Anderson is the newest star to shock his fans with a drastic new haircut.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Forum
The next Ecumenical Forum on Monday, October 21, in the Neues Museum des Schloss is about the topic "To Hell with Hell - Theological Considerations on Today's Dealing with the Last Things".
The speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical Churches of Salem, the Salem Castle and the Bodenseekreis Cultural Office.
Johanna Rahner wants to investigate in the forum how people today classify the "last things" after death.
If the people of the past centuries had known too much about it and had put it on those images of heaven and hell that "still shape our ideas", then the contemporary prophetic teaching of the hopes for perfection is rather characterized by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness.
“The greater hope has been driven out by religious criticism,” says the speaker.
She has "provided us with so many question marks that the exclamation marks seem to have gone away from us".
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the decisive challenge remains the anger of death."
This is the question of that longing, "which dreams that everything may be good in the end."
Johanna Rahner, born in Baden-Baden in 1962, studied Catholic theology and biology at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universit<0xC3><0xA4>t Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She received her doctorate in 1997 as Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
Habilitation for fundamental theology and ecumenical theology followed in 2003 at the Westphalian Wilhelms University.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has held a Chair of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from Kleine Heuberg confirm their creed in the firmament
In two services, 101 15- and 16-year-old youths of the pastoral unit Am Kleine Heuberg have been established.
In the morning, the Laudato-Si group accompanied the worship service, in the afternoon of the youth choir The Spirit.
With the reception of the firm sacrament, the young people said yes to their baptism and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit.
The firm members had been preparing for the big holiday in recent months, under the leadership of Diakon Reiner Dehner and the help of numerous parishioners.
In different projects they got to know different tasks of Christian community life and together experienced the Youth Day in Untermachtal.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race inspires participants
In wonderful weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to complete the roundabout over the hill chains around the lake.
Ulrich Knobel from the sporting association Illmensee.
Among the participants were, especially on the short distance over 15 kilometers and 300 meters of altitude, also numerous cyclists who wanted to practice their hobby once in a competitive atmosphere.
Two junior drivers of the German top class were also at the start in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation of good rankings at the German Championships.
Both of them were able to get off the field as expected.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small amount of time to the finish line and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance.
In second place Pascal Treubel was again able to place himself in second place.
For the ladies, it was Theresa Duelli from the team nightmare who made it to the top of the winning ladder.
In second and third place came Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie drivers from Owingen.
An enjoyable development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community.
Not only in terms of performance, the entire range of athletes was represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years in the youngest to over 70 years in the oldest starters.
In the main race, even more absolute top athletes were at the start this year.
Four drivers were able to get away from the top regional drivers.
Including Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike semi-professional from the Black-Tusk racing team.
Pangerl has been the world champion in twelve-hour driving together with a teammate twice.
This year he became European champion in this special discipline.
Roland Ballerstedt, who has already named two German championship titles in the duathlon his own.
After 45 kilometres and 900 metres of altitude, a final lash was reached in the finish line in front of the Three Lakes Hall.
Pangerl raced first over the finish line.
Only a second behind that, the Routinier Ballerstedt was able to secure second place in the overall standings.
At the same time Hermann and Warthmann came to the finish as third of the overall score.
In the women's ranking, Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest timer in the main race.
Blersch from Binzwangen secured second place in front of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well organized running of the event.

Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 of the 2013 CNN Heroes.
You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the Top 10 to choose him as the "CNN Hero of the Year".
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched as his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first he had only one broken arm, but then an inflammation formed that spread to his brain and there caused a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in crowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
“It’s not easy,” says Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five o’clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, but you’re not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle’s father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for 5,000 people each, according to the World Health Organization.
In contrast, the ratio in the United States is with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most Cameroonians could not afford to visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of health spending in the country is private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” says Bwelle.
Poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
Seeing his father and so many of his compatriots suffering in Bwelle made the decision to do something about it mature.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team carried out 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor himself and worked as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels on weekends in rural areas and provides free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people are forced into minibuses and driving on the roof over unpaved terrain to the villages that need help with the laced medical equipment.
Not always everything runs smoothly.
More than once, they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will receive like heroes: a feast, singing and dancing and the best lodging the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and Bwelle – with its broad smile and boundless energy – is happy to attend the joyful celebration.
The next morning, the team starts investigating hundreds of patients.
“We treat 500 people per trip,” says Bwelle.
They come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village – and on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses, or free birth certificates – a document that is required for school but many poor families simply can’t afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia.
The surgeries usually take place in a school, town hall or apartment; after the procedure, the patients get up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next one.
The lighting for the surgery and disinfection equipment is fed by the generator of the group and so Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early morning hours on Sunday.
It’s a strenuous curriculum, but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
“They’re drumming all night so we can stay awake and continue our work,” says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team then drives back to the city, tired, but proud of the work done.
The group – a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – carried out 700 free surgeries last year and knows that their work makes a huge difference to the people they help.
One man explained that the free operation of a fracture he had received now allows him to work again.
“This is changing the future of my family,” the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his non-profit activity, according to Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
“I really don’t know when he’s going to sleep,” says Katie O’Malley, who studies medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia in the second year and volunteers to join Bwelle’s group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who come from the US and Europe and support Bwelle, this is a chance to gain hands-on experiences they would never get at home.
“We can be involved in operations where we help to drain blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle,” O’Malley explains.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and often bring donated medical supplies with them.
But once they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transport and guidance.
“He’s definitely a hero,” says O’Malley.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no bounds.
For Bwelle, almost constant work is not a burden.
Helping others to live a happier life and thus fulfilling a promise he has made to his father gives him great joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this work,” says Bwelle.
And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and to ease the pain.

Excellently mastered the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's short story "The Old Man and the Sea", is cut to the body by Horst Janson.
Janson himself is an old hare in his metier, acting.
The old man Santiago can't be fooled by anyone fishing.
So the two just complement each other great.
It is almost thought to be able to see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man, of whom the fishing boy Manolo speaks.
When Santiago is sitting tired of life bent on the chair, it is real with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson excels.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and also his willpower.
Janson is on stage as a solo artist.
He manages to focus the attention of the audience on himself, so that his monologues are not boring for a moment.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea consists only of blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he highlights the active scene: Santiago’s hut, the bar of singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who sings Cuba’s way of life with her songs and her magnificent voice.
The four musicians play Cuba’s rhythm and are guests of the bar at the same time.
Tourism: descent to the Romans
At about 120 meters in length, a sewer from the Roman period is preserved below Cologne.
Those who visit Cologne will not pass the cathedral.
Around 157 meters, the two towers protrude into the sky and make it the second tallest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors, who admire the two filigree church towers, suspect that there is a lot to discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne’s underworld.
The meeting point for his guided tours is the service center of Cologne-Tourismus directly at the cathedral.
The tour begins unspectacularly: "We start in the underground car park," Schulze says.
In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted an auto-righteous city, and therefore only what was not too large remained of the remnants of the old city walls.
Most users of the car park therefore also rush past the Roman remains today and leave only their car.
But if you look more closely, an archaeological site separated by metal lattice rods is discovered in the parking deck D2.
You can see about five meters high ruins made of hand plate-sized stones.
“It is the remains of the Roman city wall that was built in the second half of the first century AD,” Schulze says.
Before returning to daylight, Schulze lets the participants at the upper level of the park take a look into a dark, 15 meter deep shaft.
This is the fountain of the old cathedral, which unfortunately is hardly noticed.
The next stop of the tour is the pretorium, and here the participants go back down to the depth.
We experience here the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the pretor of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which in good German means "City of Roman Right and City of Agrippinens, founded under Emperor Claudius at the site of the altar for the emperor's cult".
And the pretorium is the former Palace of Governors, the centre of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the front room of the exhibition, a tunnel access leads to the Roman sewer, which is maintained here at about 120 meters in length.
“You can walk along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want,” Schulze cheers up the guests.
There's still a surprise for Schulze.
After getting the key at the cash desk, he leads the group to a 16-metre-deep, walkable shaft.
“We are now in the mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath,” he explains.
The Jewish community built their bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater that was essential for the ritual washings.
To this day, in the lower end of the mikwe, whose origins go back to the eighth century, different water levels can be read by changing levels of the Rhine.
The mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the town hall square, for which the construction work will soon begin.
However, a few more years will pass until the completion.
Leg almost chopped off: Reissue of Rocker process
A bloody attack in the rocker environment will be re-rolled after more than four years.
A trial for attempted homicide, dangerous bodily injury and property damage against two 30-year-olds has begun in front of the District Court of Frankfurt (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict safety precautions.
The defendants remained silent until the start.
They are said to have been active in the rockers scene and then belonged to the bandidos.
The prosecutor’s office accuses them of stabbing and beating three men in a car in June 2009 together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt.
All the victims were seriously injured, a man almost lost his leg.
The victims are said to have belonged to the competing group Hells Angels.
One is said to have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
It was apparently a chase with several cars.
According to the indictment, it was about gunfights and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants were acquitted in a first trial in early 2012.
A court spokesman said at the time that it could not have been proven that the men were actually involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized.
The Federal Court of Justice revoked the judgment after revision of the Public Prosecutor’s Office and referred it back to the Landgericht for re-negotiation.
One of the defendants is currently in open execution for another offence.
The start was mainly about the reconstruction of the processes in Tatnacht.
As a witness, the Commissioner in charge at the time was invited.
In the center were cell phone conversations of the defendants and other people who had been interrogated by the police.
It’s hard to believe that Rocker almost always adheres to a law that’s right for her – and doesn’t say anything.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had unpacked.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Frankfurt Public Prosecutor’s Office (Oder) said on demand that new traces have emerged since the last trial.
Eleven more days of negotiations are scheduled for the trial.
The throwaway company does not think
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood was good, but at some point it goes home.
Only: In the brooks of the people in the passenger and rear seat, the hunger is noticeable.
Of course, one or the other cocktail or sparkling wine may be responsible for this!
What’s closer than riding chilled to the next drive-in to indulge in a little something?
I admit, I like to be there when it comes to fast food holls late at night or early in the morning.
A few fries, a cola, a burger - and then nothing like going home and going to bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry discogoers are noticeable.
Because what is missing is that you throw your fast food bags out of the car window with constant regularity?!
Especially on weekends there are discarded paper bags on the street edges and on parking lots.
“Why?” I ask myself.
Are people too deaf to take the bags home or to the next trash can?
It’s not just that the paper product is disintegrating the landscape.
Bags have already covered transport facilities such as control boards and thus caused accidents.
But what the "rejection society" does not think about, it probably does not even know what this word actually means.
If you travel more often in the evening, especially with several people in the car, you know what a back bench can look like after through the night: clothes, bottles and other garbage are storming there.
There would be a few bags more or less but nothing - unlike the street, where no one wants to trample on the food leftovers of others.
I can already see the day when the cities and communities are getting too stupid to clean away - and the fast food chains have to demand a deposit for their bags.
Obama’s Retirement in Health Policy
After harsh criticism, President Obama made a withdrawal yesterday with his frequently repeated, clear promise: “If you like your health insurance, then you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands of people received a letter of resignation from their insurer, Republicans accused the president of deceiving the American public in the last few days.
Yesterday, Obama relativized his original promise.
“The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance policy can keep them,” he said at a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the resignations, Obama called on those Americans who received such messages to look around for a new insurance policy in the free market.
Most citizens could thus get better, more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or cheaper than predicted.
“They’re coming up with a better offer,” he said.
The government described it as unsurprising that the five percent of the population who have taken out insurance themselves would have to look for a different tariff, as their contract does not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
“I would like to say to these Americans directly: they deserve better,” Sebelius said at a hearing before the Energy and Trade Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, explained that the launch of the online platform has been “miserable” since October.
“I’m just as frustrated and angry as everyone else,” she said.
I am determined to regain your trust.
This statement by an upset Sebelius to a behind-the-scenes adviser at yesterday’s hearing in the House of Representatives was taken up after a dispute with Republican MP Billy Long of Missouri, which was about whether she should be required to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly questioned why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily waive state-sponsored insurance to conclude a tariff for herself at HealthCare.gov, which she now wants to sell to millions of Americans.
Jerusalem government does not confirm attack on Syrian air force base
A U.S. government official who wanted to remain anonymous said on Thursday to the U.S. news channel CNN that Israeli fighter jets had attacked an air force base in Syria’s Latakia a day earlier.
The target was “missiles and related equipment,” which the Israeli government feared were intended for Lebanese Hezbollah, according to CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as Arab broadcaster Al-Arabiya, had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been shelled from Wednesday to Thursday on the night, and blamed the Israelis for it.
The Israeli TV channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia, on which Russian S-125 Newa defense missiles, as well as a battery of SA-3 missiles, could be seen, which, according to Channel 2, have a range of 35 kilometers and transport explosive heads up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertain The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the Reuters news agency quoted an anonymous Israeli government official as saying he believed Israel had carried out the attack, but was not sure.
A spokesman for the Israeli Defense Ministry said, “We do not comment on these reports.”
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had already tried, in part successfully, to deliver ground-air missiles to Hezbollah.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a “red line” to which a military response would follow.
John Kerry, in an unprecedented admission, said the US spying was “inappropriately gone too far”
John Kerry, with an unexpected admission, suggested a wake-up call to the US’s defensive stance regarding its surveillance programs, saying the espionage had “inadequately gone too far” in certain cases.
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, along with Barack Obama, was responsible for switching to “autopilot” when the explosive revelations of whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA’s spying activities became public.
Through the leaked information, the U.S. government has entered a diplomatic storm of disarmament on the part of its allies.
Speaking at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: “Without question, the President and I, as well as others in the government, have learned about some things that have expired almost by autopilot simply because of the ability to do what still dates back to World War II and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, to September 11.”
He then admitted as the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government that U.S. espionage had crossed a border, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said, “In some cases, this has gone too far.”
The president is determined to create clarity, and therefore conducts a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse is taking place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons in this process will not be affected.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force of good and that many lives had been saved through its surveillance operations.
He added: “We are dealing with a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is obsessed with killing people, blowing up and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to intercept and stop it before it happened?
We have actually prevented plane crashes, attacks on buildings and the killing of people because we have learned about such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to disperse concerns about alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the U.S. in anti-terrorism efforts, as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said he spoke to representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to no longer engage in anti-terrorism organizations due to frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency.
“It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that Europeans remain on board with regard to our joint efforts against terrorism,” Murphy, who is a Democrat for the first time in the Senate and serves as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, said in an interview in Washington.
In addition, I am going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger over the NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of phone data in Europe have strained relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the intelligence service this week said the reports were inaccurate and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations cited from documents shared by Snowden, according to which the NSA monitored the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of national intelligence, James Clapper, defended the spying among allies as necessary and stated that this was common on both sides.
In all the tumult, Murphy said his authority was preparing the trip of Congress to take place this year, and hoped the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating members will be published in the coming days.
He said the exact itinerary is still being worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relationships, he also said that there would be some “serious words.”
He said European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programs they have been using for years.
“We can change our surveillance programmes and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, but they also have to deal with the fact that we are not the only ones spying,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is on a weekend trip to the Middle East and Poland to deal with the resentment over the U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the U.S. surveillance activities.
A persistent injury to the ankle threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the Bundesliga away match of FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg.
Mainz asks for an assignment from Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team.
So far, he has only been able to do this individually.
“We will decide on his deployment in the short term,” coach Thomas Tuchel said.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his top scorer with six hits.
After all, the Mainzers already have to give up the injured performers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australian woman faces jail sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver, filed an appeal against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 for making a false statement after telling Thai police that a local taxi driver raped her in the morning hours on Sunday, June 10 while two other men detained her.
Later, however, the footage of a video camera showed that she had safely arrived at her hotel after being separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she confessed to having invented the story.
Until the court hearing, she was in police custody.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security prison on the outskirts of Phuket, rather than in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy League, who turned to the Canberra Foreign Ministry with the request for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was “extremely concerned” about his daughter’s well-being and wanted her back in Australia.
“We are of course very worried, but we hope that she will be back home as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford has filed an appeal against the ruling and is on the loose against a bail of 50,000 baht.
In Australian reports it was read that in the meantime she is taking a vacation in the resort of Krabi in South Thailand.
The court heard Bamford being represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and warned that the appeal could also result in a higher sentence of up to two years in an adult prison.
However, it is also possible that after the recent murder of travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may be trying to improve its tarnished tourist image, and therefore there will be an acquittal.
