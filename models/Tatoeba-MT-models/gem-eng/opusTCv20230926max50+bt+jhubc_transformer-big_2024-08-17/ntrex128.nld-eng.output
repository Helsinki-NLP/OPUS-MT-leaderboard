Members of the National Assembly of Wales worried that they will be ‘compared to Muppets’
There is a stir among the Members of the National Assembly of Wales by a proposal that their title would be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal is a result of plans to change the current name ‘Welsh Assembly’ to ‘Welsh Parliament’.
Members of the National Assembly of various political parties are concerned that the new name will be ridiculed.
A member of the Labour Party's National Assembly of Wales said that MWP "raised on Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: twp is Welsh for crazy and pwp is Welsh for poop.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Plaid Party said that the group as a whole is “unsatisfied” and has proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his party is “open” to the name change, but notes that the words MWP and Muppet are very similar.
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced as a short u.
The Commission of the National Assembly of Wales, which is currently drafting legislation to carry out the name change, said: “It is of course the members of the National Assembly of Wales itself who are taking the final decision on their new title.”
With the Government of Wales Act 2017, members of the National Assembly of Wales were granted the right to change the name of the Assembly.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people found that the National Assembly should be renamed Parliament.
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission proposed ‘Welsh Parliament Members’ or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in the public consultation.
At the moment, members of the National Assembly would propose alternatives, but President Elin Jones will have a hard time reaching a consensus, and she will have to file a bill on the changes in a few weeks' time.
The reform legislation also includes other changes to the way the National Assembly works, including rules on the suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the system of committees.
The members of the National Assembly will be able to vote definitively on their new title when they debate the legislation.
Residents of Macedonia vote in a referendum on changing their country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote to change their country’s name to ‘Republic of North Macedonia’.
The popular referendum was organized in an attempt to resolve a pending dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour means that the country would make a claim on its territory and has already repeatedly objected to requests from Macedonia to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is against the referendum on the name change, has said he will not take into account the outcome of the referendum.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of Saint Martin's silence, those of Harlem are having a hard time
“The older people I spoke with said that there used to be a café and a church here on every corner,” Mr. Adams said.
Today there is neither a cafe nor a church to look at.”
He said it's understandable that cafes have disappeared.
“People now have social contact in a different way,” he said.
“Cafés are no longer the living room of the neighborhood, where people regularly walk by.”
However, he is concerned that the proceeds of the sale of the assets of the churches will go on for less time than the leaders expect, “and sooner or later they will be left behind at the beginning.”
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings with flats where the kind of people would live that will not help in the remaining refuges of the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of the people who will buy flats in such buildings will be white,” he says, “which will lead to these churches being closed even faster, because it is unlikely that the people who move to these flats will become members of the church community.”
Both churches were once built by a white church, before Harlem became a black metropolis: the metropolitan community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original church of white Methodists left in the 1930s.
A nearby black church took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the shopkeepers at 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, where blacks could rarely get a job or be promoted.
In 1939, the building was seriously damaged by fire, but when the parishioners of Reverend Johnson planned to rebuild the church, they also bought a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Reverend Johnson and his successor in Saint Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the carillon in July referred in a different way to the instrument: ‘a cultural treasure’ and ‘an irreplaceable historical instrument’.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first carillon in the world ever played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said Saint Martin's hadn't replaced him.
The events of the last months in Saint Martin's are a complicated story of architects and contractors, some hired by the lay leaders of the church, others by the diocese.
The consistory (the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders) wrote the diocese in July to express its concern that the diocese would ‘transmit the costs’ to the consistory, although the consistory had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors who had sent the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old who dives into lobsters in California
Saturday, on the first day of the lobster season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy who dived into lobsters in California. The boy suffered injuries, it says.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday when he heard the boy screaming for help. Together with some others, he paddled to the boy to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought the boy was calling because he had caught a lobster, but then he realized ‘that the boy was calling, ‘I’m bitten!
I'm bitten!"
His clavicle was completely open,” Hammel saw as he approached the boy.
“I screamed that everyone had to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is said to be in danger of life.
It is not known which shark species is responsible for the attack.
Beach guard Captain Larry Giles told a press conference that a shark had been spotted nearby a few weeks before, but that it had been concluded then that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured in the upper body.
The authorities closed access to Ponto Beach beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours with a view to research and safety.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species living in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's wants to break through on the British beauty market
Sainsbury’s competes with Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams, setting up beauty departments where specialized assistants work, such as in grocery stores.
The initiative is part of a strategy to conquer the British beauty market, which is worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to grow, while the sale of fashion and household items continues to decline. The larger beauty departments are being tested in 11 stores across the country. If they prove to be a success, they will be introduced in even more stores next year.
The investment in the beauty market is also a result of the fact that supermarkets want to fill the shelves where TVs, microwaves and interior items once stood, with other products.
Sainsbury's wants to double its beauty offering and offer 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also gets more space, with exhibition space per brand, such as in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also re-markets its boutique make-up, now that most products are suitable for vegans, something younger shoppers are demanding more and more.
In addition, perfumery the Fragrance Shop will test out concessions in two stores of Sainsbury's. The first opened in Croydon, in southern London, the second will open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
As more and more people shop online and increasingly on a daily basis buy small amounts of food in local supermarkets, supermarkets need to make more effort to convince people to shop with them.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive of Sainsbury's, says the stores will look more and more like warehouses, as the supermarket chain takes it up against discounters Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos outlets into hundreds of stores and has also opened a number of Habitats since both chains were acquired two years ago. According to the company, the sale of food has increased and the acquisitions have yielded more returns.
The last time the supermarket tried to give its Beauty and Pharmacy departments a makeover, it became a flop.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership was terminated when a conflict arose over the distribution of income from the pharmacy department in the supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury’s has sold 281 pharmacy departments in stores three years ago for an amount of <0xC2><0xA3>125 million to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan, adding an extensive range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have completely changed the design of our beauty department so that it is more pleasant for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our employees, who will be ready to give advice.
With our range of brands, we offer something for everyone, and thanks to the attractive environment and convenient locations, we ensure that our customers like to buy their beauty products with us, and no longer shop in the old way."
Peter Jones 'worst' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Peter Jones, one of Dragons Den’s stars, is “infurious” because TV presenter Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle company. She wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for True, their brand for homewear and accessories.
The company of Jones and Willoughby is sometimes compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning’s 37-year-old presenter announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Peter Jones of Dragons Den is furious at Holly Willoughby, as she has withdrawn from their profitable lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was “infuriated” when Willoughby announced on Tuesday during a difficult meeting at the company’s headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that her new contracts (with a value of <0xC2><0xA3>1 and a half million) did not provide enough time for Truly, their homewear and accessories brand.
The company is sometimes compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby’s fortune of an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she would leave Truly, Jones left for one of his vacation homes abroad.
One source said, “Truly was one of Holly’s top priorities.
It would ensure its long-term future, and provide enough for the next decades.
Everyone was stunned when she decided to retire.
No one could believe his ears last Tuesday because the launch was scheduled for soon.
The warehouse of the headquarters in Marlow is full of products ready for sale.”
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter, one of Britain’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions, due to the large investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear, and because the launch could now be further delays.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been well friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly in 2016 together with Capp, and Jones, 52, became Chairman of the company in March.
The two couples often go on vacation together and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby will soon become M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as a presenter of the I'm A Celebrity program on the UK channel ITV.
A source from Jones’ entourage said last night: “We have no comment on his business matters.”
Hard language, and then there was love between us.
He joked about the criticism he would get in the media about a comment he made that some people would find ‘inappropriate to a president’, and about his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump imitated a news anchor when he said:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He added that Kim is interested in a second meeting. Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore a major step towards the dismantling of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons have stalled.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a “consistent response” by the United States after North Korea’s first disarmament initiatives.
Meanwhile, the United States is continuing its sanctions to keep the pressure on the boiler, he says.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the election rally.
“We are doing very well in North Korea,” he said.
“We were close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship.”
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have led to positive results. The missile tests have ended, hostages have been released and the physical surpluses of American soldiers have returned to their own country.
He also defended his unusual approach to his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave like a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to access this busy arena, there would be about 200 people standing here,” Trump said, as he was to the public in front of him.
Indonesia's tsunami and earthquake destroys an island, killing hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok’s population no longer had a home, no national disaster was announced, which is a requirement for initiating international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, it is clear that they are not seeking international assistance, which is difficult for us,” Ms. Sumbung said.
Save the Children is preparing a team to travel to Palu, but it is not certain that the relief workers from abroad can work on the spot.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the agency for national disaster relief, said Indonesian officials were still evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to help.
Although Indonesia is constantly plagued by earthquakes, the country is still particularly poorly prepared for the wrath of nature.
In Aceh, shelters were built to shelter at tsunamis, but along other coasts you rarely see them.
That there were no warning sirens for tsunamis in Palu, although a warning was in force, has probably contributed to the number of deaths.
Even in ideal conditions, it can be difficult to travel from one Indonesian island to another.
National disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship docked in Lombok to treat victims of earthquakes is now en route to Palu, but it will take at least three days before the ship has reached the site of the disaster.
The improvement of Indonesia’s hareless infrastructure was one of the core points of President Joko Widodo’s election campaign, and he has already spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But President Joko’s government is facing a shortage of funding, and while he hopes to be reelected next year.
President Joko is also being pressured by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Islamic majority today follow a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their homes because Christian and Islamic gangs were fighting on the streets, with machetes, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.
Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool makes an impressive equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool last Saturday from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League, with a goal in the 89th minute, during a game at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he stood at a distance of about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal, at the time his team was behind 1-0.
He tapped left against the ball and then kicked in the direction of the furthest pole.
The ball flew high above the penalty kick area, in the direction of the top right corner of the net.
He deflected the jump from Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play as much forward as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
‘I saw Kante approaching and took a shot. I didn’t really think about it, I was just kicking the ball.’
Chelsea were 1-0 ahead, after a goal from the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues' head kicked the ball with his heel to Mateo Kovacic, after which he rushed to Liverpool's half-way through the midfield.
Kovacic did a quick one-tweet in the midfield.
After that, he gave a nice stabbing pass, allowing Hazard to reach the penalty area.
Hazard was faster than the defense and kicked the ball with his left foot past Alisson Becker of Liverpool in the net, next to the rear pole.
Liverpool will play Wednesday at 3 p.m. in the group stage of the Champions League against Napoli, at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will compete against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the agency said in a statement on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that had collapsed as a result of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 from last Friday, which also caused waves of 6 m high, spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, is full of rubble from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman has been stabbed to death
This morning, a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, after which a murder investigation was opened.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 a.m. in Grayson Mews, John Street. The body showed stab wounds. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking local residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Police Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation has only just begun, but I want everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard requests to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, to contact us if they may have filmed something through a dashcam, because they can have information that is essential to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends came who think they know the woman on the spot to ask questions about the place where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have confirmed that they are currently informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews tried to enter his apartment, but was told by the police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Residents are now told that it will take hours before they can return home.
A police officer told someone that the area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared crying on the spot.
She just kept repeating, ‘What a shame!’
At 2 p.m. two police cars were inside the mooring and a third were just outside.
Within the mooring, a number of agents kept an eye on the apartment building.
Anyone who has information is asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, to call 101 or to contact Crimestoppers anonymously on the number 0800 555 111, stating log 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue to the British Parliament is the latest victim of the 'rewriting history' rel
The banishment of the statue would be a poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of the many cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatically puritanical followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick’s suggestion as “foolish” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the current debate on the removal of statues would lead to the screening of Oliver Cromwell’s figure just outside the Houses of Parliament.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
The beautiful image of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, bears witness to the opinion that prevailed in the 19th century and is part of the history of a figure that, according to many, still needs recognition today.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely correct presentation is still being debated.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure that represents one side of that gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector must also be recognized and remembered.”
Murderous Pig Kills Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwestern China, according to reports in the local media.
The man, whose only surname is known as ‘Yuan’, was found dead at a stall in the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province. His artery was pierced and he was under the blood, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inhale pigs at a pig stable, on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
He is said to have travelled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and turned out to be open a door to a neighboring pig stable.
According to the cousin, a large male pig with blood on its mouth was found in the pig cage.
A forensic study found that the 250 kg pig killed the farmer, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bloodied and maimed,” said the cousin with the surname ‘Wu’, according to the newspaper Guiyang Evening News.
On images of surveillance cameras, it can be seen that Yuan arrived on the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not Yuan's or his cousin's.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking others, while police gathered evidence on the spot.
Yuan’s family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
It rarely happens, but there have been cases of pigs attacking people before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing the man to be seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 300 kg pushed a farmer from Wales against his tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
When a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba at CBC News testified that pigs are normally not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can provoke aggression.
“They’re just playful.
They're like kids, very curious... they're not out to hurt people.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect,” he said.
The tail of Hurricane Rosa brings heavy rain to the southwest of the US
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it reaches the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring heavy rains to the north of Mexico and the southwest.
With a wind speed of 135 km per hour, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane at 5 o'clock local time on Sunday morning and was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough begins to form over the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, tropical humidity is pushed northward, to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring 10 centimetres of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, tropical moisture that reacts with the approaching trough will cause widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous floods, debris flows and possibly landslides in the desert.
Tropical moisture will cause precipitation from 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to rain 5 to 10 cm in parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
There are sudden floods possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions, as the tropical rain can fall very widely.
It is strongly advised not to enter the desert on foot when the tropical rainfall threatens.
The heavy rainfall can turn ravines into raging rivers, and thunderstorms will produce local wind and dust.
The approaching trough brings some heavy rain locally to parts of the Southern California coastline.
Rain of 1.5 cm is possible, which could lead to small debris flows and slippery roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the region in the rainy season.
Spreading tropical rains will approach Arizona on Sunday evening until Monday morning, after which the rain will spread more on Mondays at the end of the day and Tuesdays.
Heavy rainfall will spread across the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue to fall until Wednesday.
In October, the temperature in the U.S. can fluctuate sharply, as the North Pole becomes cooler, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to large differences in temperature over short distances.
There is a fine example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the US on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the ongoing summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
In much of the middle and east of the U.S., October is expected to start hot, with temperatures hovering around 30°C, from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York, it can get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees warmer than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that there is a high chance of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States by mid-October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million people watched one of six television networks on Thursday after the gripping testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, while broadcasters interrupted the regular programming for Friday's surprise: an agreement arranged by Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, to investigate the charge for a week.
Ford told the Senate Committee on Justice that she is 100 percent sure that a drunk Kavanaugh touched her and tried to take off her clothes during a high school party.
Kavanaugh stated in an animated testimony that he was 100 percent sure that this had not happened.
More than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen have probably watched Friday.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures were not immediately available for the other networks that broadcast the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who look in an office.
For comparison, that’s about as much as for a play-off of a football match or for the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, which supports Kavanaugh’s nomination, had the most viewers during the day of the hearing: an average of 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Even after the hearing, the audience remained very interested.
Flake was the central figure of the events on Friday.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would support Kavanaugh with his voice, CNN and CBS' cameras recorded on Friday morning that protesters were yelling at him as he tried to take the elevator to a hearing of the Justice Commission.
He continued to stand for a few minutes with his eyes down while being insulted, live on CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth to the people?
Someone shouted, “You have power, while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and just before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more during the hearing.
The various channels broadcast everything live when the court committee had to vote hours later on the appointment of Kavanaugh in the Senate.
But Flake said he would only vote in favour with the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee by next week, something that the Democrats are urging the minority.
Flake was convinced, among other things, by his friend Chris Coons, Senator and Democrat.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several senators.
Flake's choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister May Accuses Critics of 'A Political Game' on Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who criticized her plans to leave the European Union of “a political game” with Britain’s future and undermining national interests.
Prime Minister of Great Britain Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, on the same front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson highlighted his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that her proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other’s taxes was “absurd.”
Wayde Sims shooting: police arrest Dyteon Simpson as suspect of LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect for the shooting in which Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU, was shot dead.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and is in prison on suspicion of murder, Baton Rouge police said.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses on the scene and found Simpson's DNA on the glasses, reports WAFB, a CBS television station.
The police interrogated Simpson and later stated that he had confessed that he had shot Wayde with the result of death.
His bail is set at $350,000, the Advocate reports.
The coroner of the congregation in East Baton Rouge on Friday published a preliminary report stating that the cause of death is a gunshot wound in the neck.
The report states that the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and local residents have all contributed to the investigation that led to an arrest.
Sports director Joe Alleva of LSU thanked the local police for his “deployment and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 198 cm tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was ‘broken’ and ‘in shock’ by Wayde’s death.
“This is an event that you always hope will never happen,” Wade said.
Volcano spits ash on Mexico city
The ash spewed by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after activity in the crater had been picked up and 183 emissions of gas and ashes had been recorded in a 24-hour period.
The center detected several times noise and vibration.
On social media, photos of a thin layer of ashes appeared on car windows in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity in the volcano, which is located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, which is the first time since September 2017, when an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 hit the Richter Central Mexico scale.
The volcano, called ‘Don Goyo’, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence activists hit riot police, while thousands participated in rival demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the vote on independence in Catalonia that disintegrated the region into two groups.
A group of masked pro-separatists who were stopped by the riot police beat the agents with eggs and powder paint, creating dark dust clouds in the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Later in the day, skirmishes broke out with the police, and the cops pulled their baton up to stop the fighting.
For more than an hour, pro-independence groups sang, “Don’t forget, don’t forgive,” while their opponents shouted, “Long live Spain.”
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries they sustained during the protests, the local press reported.
Tensions continue to rise high in the independence-minded region, one year after the October 1 referendum, which is considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters voted overwhelmingly to become independent, although the rise was low and the people opposed to secession boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote in the polling stations in the region, resulting in violent skirmishes.
Pro-independence groups had camped on site the night of Friday on Saturday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but they were forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful about Catalonia’s prospects of independence.
“Last year we experienced one of our most beautiful moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although the Catalan pro-independence parties achieved an essential victory in the regional elections in December, even though it was suffocating, this year it was difficult for them to build on their success. Many of their best-known leaders are absent, either in self-imposed exile or in captivity, pending a lawsuit over their role in organizing the referendum.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protest in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict had been sparked by politicians on both sides.
“The tensions are increasing,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been in provisional custody since the end of last year, declared that he will take part in the European Parliament elections next year.
“A candidacy for the European elections is the best way to denounce the decline of the democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after home was rammed with a car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car was repeatedly rammed into a Londonderry home.
The incident occurred on Thursday around 7.30 p.m. local time in Ballynagard Crescent.
Police Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself had been damaged.
A crossbow may have been fired on the car at some point.
Livingston wins 1-0 against Rangers thanks to Menga's goal
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston gave them victory
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers and delivered Steven Gerrard his second defeat in a series of 18 games since he was manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference and Gary Holt's team came to the same level as Hibernian.
Gerrard's team failed this season to win an away game during the Premiership, and they must face leader Hearts on Sunday, who faces eight points ahead of them.
But first, the Rangers receive Rapid Vienna Thursday in the Europa League.
Livingston is still unbeaten, and the team has already won six consecutive games in his division, and coach Holt has not suffered any defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against strong visitors
The Holt team had long been able to achieve a head start for the first goal, because their direct way of playing caused all kinds of problems with the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but failed to finish it with a goal, then Alan Lithgow, who picked up Craig Halkett's head ball, kicked the ball over the goal.
The home team let the Rangers play with pleasure, and waited for his chances calmly and confidently.
And that eventually led to the crucial goal.
The Rangers allowed a free kick and Livingston made an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create an opportunity for Menga, who scored from the penalty area.
At the time, the Rangers had been in possession of the ball for quite some time, but the defense of the home team was unmistakable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had not yet had much to do.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos ensured that Kelly had to avoid a goal.
Scott Pittman kicked the ball at the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed the goal after a run by his colleagues from Livingston.
Two times a penalty kick was refused, one after Halkett's attack on striker Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
'Fenomenal' by Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal achievement and result for Livingston.
They played excellently without exception and continue to exceed expectations in their race to the top.
Their style of playing and the composition of their team has hardly changed since their return to the highest regions, but Holt deserves a lot of recognition for the way he has raised the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Halkett was fantastic, with an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall walked on the tops of their toes throughout the game.
However, the Rangers were unable to break through.
Although they have played very well under Gerrard, this time they did not reach their usual level.
Their final stage wasn’t good enough (they only managed to defeat the home team once) and the Rangers will now realize that they have to play better, because they are somewhere in the middle of the ranking.
Erdogan is received with mixed feelings in Cologne
Under a bright blue sky and with a broad smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany went to breakfast together in Berlin on Saturday (29 September).
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They disagree on issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then left for Cologne for the opening of a gigantic new mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called for security reasons when they barred the crowd of 25,000 people from gathering for the mosque, but many sympathizers came close to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters, many of them Kurds, also voiced their voices, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The rival protests reflect the division over a visitor who is praised by some German Turks as a hero and accused by others as autocratic.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after collision with car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 a.m. local time.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance staff was present, but the man died on the spot.
A few months ago, another cyclist died in a flight crime accident on Childers Street, about a mile and a half from Saturday’s accident.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and his immediate family will inform.
The road is closed in several places, buses are diverted and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Prison of Long Lartin: six ciphers injured in order breakdown
Six prisoners were injured in an order breakdown in a heavily secured men's prison, according to the prison office.
The riots broke out on Sunday at about 9.30 a.m. local time at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still ongoing.
Specialized ‘Tornado’ spies have been deployed to resolve a situation involving eight prisoners in one department.
The captors were treated for minor injuries to the face.
A prison spokesman said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed for a recent incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible are at least referred to the police and may have to stay behind bars for longer.”
HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had been treated in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot police were called to prison for a serious disorder in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (with potentially positive consequences for drought areas)
It rarely happens that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s likely to happen at the beginning of next week, because the remaining energy of hurricane Rosa is moving across the southwest of the desert area, which carries risks of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings for sudden flooding for the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, and southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to hang just above Phoenix on Tuesday, and it will rain on Monday evening.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in the area of 200 miles from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimetres of precipitation, with isolated amounts up to 15 centimetres in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the southwest of the desert area, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to get 3 to 5 cm of rain, and here and there is 10 cm possible.
For areas that are not at risk of flooding, the Rosa rain can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are very worrying, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial because the southwest is currently undergoing a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the map that identifies current drought areas, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second-highest category, weather.com reported.
The route of Hurricane Rosa reaches the mainland via the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still at hurricane strength on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 140 km per hour, located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm hits cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, weakening it.
Therefore, she is expected to arrive Monday in the afternoon or evening with the power of a tropical storm in Mexico.
Heavy rain may fall in parts of Mexico, which entails a significant flood risk.
“A total of 8 to 15 cm of precipitation is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with up to 25 cm possible,” reported weather.com.
Rosa moves north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday in the early morning hours as a tropical depression, which will then travel through Arizona late on Tuesday evening and south of Utah.
“The greatest danger expected of Rosa or her tail is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest of Sonora, and southwest of the desert area,” the National Hurricane Center said.
This rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and debris flows in the deserts and landslides on mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured at about 4 a.m. local time on Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace neighborhood of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is ‘stable’.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset police.
The police are asking anyone who may have filmed something about what happened to report.
Trump says Kavanaugh “has suffered under the commonality, the anger” of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that during his appointment procedure, Kavanaugh "has suffered under the commonality, the anger" of the Democratic Party
Kavanaugh testified Thursday before Congress and vigorously and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her allegations.
The president said on Saturday that the “American people saw the brilliant and incredible character, quality and courage” of Kavanaugh that day.
“A vote to recognize Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that recognizes one of the most accomplished legal opinions of our time, a lawyer with an excellent state of service,” he told the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh’s appointment when he spoke about the importance of the Republican rise in the midterm elections.
“In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives will take place.
I'm not taking part, but I'm actually taking part," he said.
“That’s why I come up everywhere for great candidates.”
Trump stated that the Democrats are on a mission to “offer resistance and hinder us.”
The Senate's first major procedural vote on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place by Friday, a senior GOP executive told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and toll is increasing
In a major earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people were killed, many of whom were wiped off the ground when giant waves crashed on the beach, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday for a beach festival in the city of Palu, when waves of up to six meters high landed at the time it began to twilight. Many people collapsed and the waves destroyed everything on their path.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
‘When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, there were still people on the beach. They did not immediately walk away and thus became the victim of the tsunami,’ said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian agency for aid to natural disasters BNPB during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami also led to other dangers: he dragged cars, tree trunks, houses, he hit everything on the land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coastline.
Some people climbed a tree to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
On aerial photos released by the agency for help with natural disasters, it can be seen that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have been wrecked and collapsed, and a mosque is surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city continued to tremble with aftershocks.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released during the massive Friday earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb that had fallen on Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, has increased the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as ‘significant’ and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Some of the dead were trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, about 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could be even greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication with Donggala ‘is completely flat, we have no information at all,’ Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement. The staff and volunteers of the Red Cross are on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,” the Red Cross said.
The organization received a lot of criticism on Saturday because it had not said that a tsunami had hit Palu, although employees said that the waves had reached the country within the time the warning was given.
In amateur images shared on social media, a man on the upper floor of a building in panic cries out to people down the street to warn them that a tsunami is coming.
Minutes later, a wall of water falls on the coast and buildings and cars are dragged along.
Reuters was unable to verify the images immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military is currently sending cargo planes with relief goods from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuations are still in urgent need of food and other basic needs.
The city’s airport has only been reopened for aid and remains closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Tsunami death toll rises above 800.
It's very bad.
The employees of World Vision from Donggala have safely arrived in the city of Palu, where employees in the courtyard of their office are looking for shelter in tents of cover, but passed through scenes of destruction along the way, Doseb<0xC3><0xA1> said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups began the difficult task of launching emergency aid, some complained that certain foreign aid workers could not travel to Palu with great expertise.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, goods and personnel from abroad can only be allowed if the location of a disaster is declared as a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can provide international assistance, but that status has still not been declared.”
When the second night after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday fell on Palu, friends and family of the missing continued to hope that they would find their loved ones life again, as in the miracles that people so fondly belong to terrible natural disasters like this.
On Saturday, a boy was taken out of a sewer.
On Sunday, relief workers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had taken place in Indonesia earlier this month.
His students were also trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi.
“As a veteran in the paragliding world, I carry my own emotional load,” he said.
Mr. Gendon said that the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed had spread throughout the paragliding community and that he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu, who participated in the beach festival in the hours that followed.
However, only one grey check mark appeared in his messages instead of two blue check marks.
“I think that means the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Thieves Steal $26,750 While Supplying ATMs in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning stole $26,750 from an employee of Brink who was filling a cash machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport police press release.
The driver had just rented a cash machine in the entertainment complex and wanted to fill it with money, Inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the message.
When he was busy, another man ran from behind the Brink employee and stole a bag of money ready to deliver.
Witnesses saw several suspects flee, according to the press release, but police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about the identity of the perpetrators is asked to contact the Newport police on the number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
Last Saturday, he announced the change on Twitter with the words: ‘The creature formally known as Kanye West’.
The 41-year-old West has been briefly named Ye for a while and used this nickname as the title for his eighth album, which came out in June.
The name change was announced in the run-up to his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her performance during the show for “emotional reasons,” the show’s creator says.
Ye is not only an abbreviation of his current artist name, but he used to tell West that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, when he told radio presenter Big Boy about the title of his album.
“So I am you, I am us, we are us.
I switched from Kanye, which means ‘the only’, to just Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.”
He's not the only famous rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who used to work with West, has already worked with and without the link sign and the capital letters.
Mexican president vows not to use military forces against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use military power against civilians. The country is on the eve of the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use military force to oppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, military forces fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing up to 300 people, during which time leftist student movements occurred throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that young people often join criminal gangs as a result of unemployment and a lack of opportunities to study.
United States needs to double funding from A.I.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States needs to double the amount it spends on A.I. research, says investor and A.I. specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for all Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He says this following the announcements about A.I. coming from various U.S. government departments, despite the U.S. not having a formal strategy for A.I..
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year: the country wants to be number 1 in A.I. innovation by 2030.
“The budget for researching A.I. doubling would already be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the U.S., and we are looking for the next breakthrough in A.I.,” Lee said.
A doubling of funding could lead to a doubling of the likelihood that the next major achievement for A.I. will take place in the U.S., Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China’s leading A.I. companies.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an A.I. system that defeated American Othello’s best player, and later became manager of Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese Department of Google.
Lee expressed his appreciation for technology contests organized by the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next contest would take place, as it would help discover the following visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to get government subsidies, Lee said.
“China is not picking up our best academics, the companies are doing that,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited the best powers of universities to work on A.I.
Lee said U.S. efforts in the field of A.I. would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
“Anyone who is a doctoral student in the field of A.I. should automatically be offered a green card,” he said.
The Chinese National Council released its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Foundation for Natural Sciences provides financial support to staff of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, designed to involve industry and academia partners in the initiative, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that $2 billion would be invested in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing more than $100 million in research into A.I.
However, U.S. legislation that should lead to the establishment of a National Artificial Intelligence Security Commission has been in the loop for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on possible name change of their country
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change of their country's name to 'Republic of North Macedonia', which would resolve a dispute with Greece that has been dragging on for decades and would no longer hinder Greece's Macedonian application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province also called Macedonia, and says that the name of its northern neighbour means that the country claims Greek territory. Consequently, Greece vetoed the inclusion of Macedonia in the European Union and NATO.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalists believe that the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum and through a boycott campaign it is not certain that the required rise of at least 50 percent will be achieved, so the referendum may not be valid.
The question on the ballot was formulated as follows: ‘Do you support NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?’
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the price to be paid is worth trying to become a member of bodies such as the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that emerged when the former Yugoslavia disintegrated.
“I come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that will lead to a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, enough MPs have indicated that they will respect the outcome, making it decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The National Election Commission said there had been no reports of irregularities at 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent at the time, compared to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters came to vote.
‘I come to vote because it’s important for my children. Our place is in Europe,’ said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, during the referendum on the name change of the country that would open the way for membership of NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and placed chairs for tents that had been placed by people who boycotted the referendum.
“We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as a full member, not through a back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will generate much-needed investment for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I am convinced that the vast majority are in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
He said that a “yes” as a result would be “an affirmation of our future”.
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research found that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian television station Telma TV, concluded that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent would vote for it.
If the referendum is to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it came to power in May last year.
Look at: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes full defense of Brighton and scores
Last Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling briefly met Brighton's defense at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England. Manchester City won the match 2-0.
It seemed like a whistle of a cent, how Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian striker first got the ball played in the midfield.
He raced between three Brighton defenders, straight into the open field.
There, Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He managed to pass a defender and was also too fast for some others on the edge of the penalty kick area of Brighton.
Then he gave a pass to the left, where Sterling waited.
The English attacker used his first action in the penalty area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right shoe to defeat goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
“Aguero is having problems with his feet,” coach Pep Guardiola of Manchester City told the press.
“We decided to let him play for 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he stood deep in the playing field of Brighton.
He sent a beautiful pass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball for a moment and then sent Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues player taped the ball into the net, just before it was too far.
City will compete against Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League at 12.55 a.m. on Tuesday. The match will take place in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play along and not make it easy for the Rockies to reach the playoffs
Now that the Washington Nationals have been eliminated for the playoffs, there was not much reason to force a new start.
Still, the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still consequences for the Rockies' participation in the playoffs. They currently face one match at the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least got a wild card for the playoffs thanks to their 5-2 win against the Nationals last Friday, but they still want to do everything they can to ensure their first division title.
“Although there is nothing left for us, at least we can pitch with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver will be optimal with this audience and the other team probably plays at the highest level that I would encounter this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to play in that?”
The Nationals have yet to announce who will be on Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to appoint Scherzer as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, was on Thursday in the throw-in field and would still pitch next Sunday, although that is normal his rest day.
The right-handed pitcher of Washington stands at 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump to host a meeting in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court, while talking about the importance of the Republican rise in the midterm elections.
“Everything we have already achieved is at stake in November.
In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives will take place.
This is one of the really big elections. I'm not taking part, but actually I'm taking part. That's why I come up everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “We see a terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, we see it happening now.
And they're determined to take power back into their hands, no matter what they have to do for it.
It doesn’t matter who they hurt, who they have to push away to gain power and control, that’s what they want: power and control, but we won’t give them that.”
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to “offer resistance and hinder us.”
“And we’ve seen that in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “evil and mean and false and lying.”
He named the name of Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who sits on the Senate Committee on Justice, which led to a loud outcry from the public.
“Do you know what she answered?
Did you read the document?
Eh, eh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for one... that was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
The party is intolerant of people who say what they think
When the activists of Momentum voted in my local party to censor me, that was no surprise.
After all, I am the latest in a whole series of Labour MEPs who got that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received a similar treatment because she was resolutely opposed to antisemitism.
In my case, I was punished with the censorship motion because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of sound economic policies, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues to those in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated: “We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
And that was the case during most of the GC meetings on Friday evening during the eight years that I have already been a local Labour MP.
Unfortunately, that is not the tone of many meetings today and has long forgotten the promise of a ‘kinder, softer’ policy, if it had ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that a dissenting opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and any opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, colleagues who, as far as I knew, had a similar political outlook as I did, suddenly expected me to make a turnaround and take a position that I would otherwise never have agreed to, from subjects such as national security to the European single market.
Every time I speak in front of an audience, whatever I say, there are scandals on social media calling for my candidacy to be rejected as a Member of Parliament for the next elections, exposing the centre's politics and telling me that I should not be a member of Labour.
And that's just what I'm going through.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments to my address are generally political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who are dealing with a flood of sexist or racist reactions every day, but are not intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that serious scandals seem to be considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every ‘motion of distrust’ or change of selection rules, the party becomes more petty-minded.
For the past two years, I have often been advised to keep me busy, not just to proclaim my opinion loudly and then I would ‘not get in trouble’.
But I did not go into politics for that.
Since I became a member of Labour 32 years ago as a school child, provoked by the neglect of Thatcher's government which literally collapsed my classroom, I have always advocated better public services for those who need them most, both in my role as a city councillor and in my role as minister.
I have never kept my politics hidden, even in the last elections.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clarity about my policy stance and my doubts about the current leadership.
To those who have been propagating the motion Friday, I can only say one thing: when the country drags on to a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But actually I have only one message, and it is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that threats to reject my candidacy as a Member of Parliament for the next election or political opportunities will not prevent me from acting according to what I think is in your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeaten Ayr on the way to the top
Two late try's may have slightly skewed the end result, but there is no doubt that Ayr is rightly triumphing in this delightful match of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the ranking, the only unbeaten team of the ten.
Ultimately, it was both their superior defense and their better chances that won the home team, and coach Peter Murchie was allowed to be satisfied.
“We’ve had a hard time in our games so far and we’re still unbeaten, so I’m a happy man,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose: ‘All the honors to Ayr, they have taken better advantage of their opportunities than we have.’
Grant Anderson's try in the 14th minute, completed by Frazier Climo, led to a lead for Ayr, but by a yellow card from Rory Hughes of the Scottish national team (which he received during the Warriors' match), Melrose was able to get the numbers and Jason Baggot managed to break a try.
With a penalty, Climo made an extra lead for Ayr and scored a conversion after a solo try just before the break, making it 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, followed by a conversion of Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
The match was long overdue for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, which was drained on a branch card, and once the match had restarted, Ayr could continue to run through a try by Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion of Climo.
Then Ayr's leader Blair Macpherson got a yellow card, and again Melrose settled with the extra man when no conversion followed on a try by Bruce Colvine at the end of a game where the pressure was very high.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he tackled Climo without the ball, MacPherson behind the advancing Ayr mouth made a touch-down to the penalty line-out.
Climo took care of the conversion, and did so again almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up the box kick from David Armstrong and sent halfback Gregor Henry away for the home team's fifth try.
Star of Still Game is ready for new career in the restaurant world
It looks like actor Ford Kieran from Still Game is going into the catering industry, and apparently he has been appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he acts with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the series, and it seems Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official data, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the story, but a source from the Scottish Sun showed that Kiernan was looking for a way to participate in the ‘flowering restaurant business’ in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': the country-locked Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific Ocean
Sailor patrols in a witness-covered naval office in La Paz.
An ocean-blue flag is waving at public buildings.
On all naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto is: ‘The sea is ours.
It is a duty to win them back.”
Throughout Bolivia, the memory of the coastline that the country has had to abandon to Chile after a bloody nineteenth-century commodity conflict is still vivid, as is the desire to re-conquer the Pacific Ocean.
That hope may have reached its highest point in recent decades, as Bolivia is waiting for a ruling from the International Court of Justice, which should be debated on October 1 after five years.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, of course, looks forward to the result with positive prospects,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will look at the court’s ruling on large screens, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will argue in favor of Bolivia that Chile, after decades of heated talks, is obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Also for Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is next year facing a controversial fight for re-election, is much at stake with Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to the return to the Pacific,” he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will probably not decide in favor of Bolivia, and even if it did, there would be little change.
The United Nations body established in the Netherlands does not have the authority to grant the Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the ruling of the International Court of Justice falls just six months after the conclusion indicates that the case was ‘not complicated’, says Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And the prospects for a positive result from Bolivia have certainly not improved, on the contrary, over the past four years the situation may have become even worse.
“The case surrounding access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian government,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales’ belligerent rhetoric has completely undermined all the good will Chile may have yet, she claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to talk further.
The two countries have not had an ambassador in each other's country since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, denied that the court’s decision was taken unusually quickly.
“On Monday, Bolivia will have an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of international relations with Chile,” he said, “and an opportunity to end 139 years of disagreements, with mutual benefits.”
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The verdict is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never remove its nuclear weapons if Washington can’t trust it.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made during a summit between rival leaders in Singapore.
He said this at the time that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart the entrenched nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the summit meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri says it is a "utopy" that the enduring sanctions and the U.S. objection to a declaration ending the Korean war will ever get North Korea on its knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree with the statement without Pyongyang first taking important steps in the field of disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is skepticism and there is doubt that Pyongyang is serious if he says he would abandon an arsenal that the country probably sees as its only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collection of huge headgear, soon available for sale in your area
If you want to expand your hat collection or keep the sun completely out of your eyes, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a series of crazy oversized headgear for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, a striking move during Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats were not to be taken away from Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their dazzling creations the catwalk on.
The striking piece of Valentino was a giant beige hat decorated with a feathery wide edge, which hung over the eyes of the models.
Other oversized accessories were watermelons set with gems, a wizard hat and even a pineapple, but those are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
With many of the colorful masks, the lips were sewn close, and they looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation looked like diving gear, complete with snorkeling and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow this bold fashion, you’re lucky.
Stylewatchers predict that the huge hats will find their way to the clothing stores near you.
The giant hats are perhaps inspired by 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-meter-wide edge that everyone wears, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that popped up everywhere on social media also created another great creation on the catwalk: a scatter beach bag that was almost as big as the model in swimsuit that the bag was wearing.
The red-orange raffia bag, set with raffia fringes and finished with a white leather handle, was the most striking piece in Jacquemus’ La Riviera SS19 collection during Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the stores next summer. Since the designer has made such a huge impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for extra large accessories.'
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
The independent schools in Scotland have an excellent track record in academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with once again a series of excellent exam results, as well as individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other initiatives of the whole community.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain popular and desirable subjects ideally within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “When you talk to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
When you talk to him in his own language, you reach his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and a bond of trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent exam results, we can conclude that languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students studying foreign languages achieved a high score.
The data, collected from 74 schools affiliated with SCIS, shows that 72 percent of students achieved a high score (“A”) in Mandarin, while 72 percent of students German, 69 percent of students French and 63 percent of students Spanish also achieved an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now valued as much as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school programs and elsewhere.
A 2014 study by the British Commission on Employment and Skills found that 17 percent of the obstacles to filling in vacancies were attributed to a lack of language skills, according to employers.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly important to prepare young people for their future careers.
As more and more job vacancies require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with such a skill for life.
Communicating directly with people from abroad automatically gives a multilingual person an edge over the competition.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation. French was the only language that excels above 10 percent, with a total of 15 percent.
This is why investing in language education is now important for today’s children.
Several languages can speak, especially those of emerging economies, will offer children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, schools choose which languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that are most important to the UK when they look ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be different languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers specializing in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills needed to succeed, regardless of the future.
It cannot currently be denied that languages in a global business environment remain vital to the future of the country, so this needs to be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
I'll faut bien le faire.

LeBron makes his debut Sunday at the Lakers in San Diego
Fans waiting for LeBron James’ first game at the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday in the opening match before the season.
It has to be determined how many minutes he will play.
“There will be more than one, and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a tweet that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers schedule for the six games ahead of the season.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need any pre-season games to prepare for it,” he said.
Trump's election rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a long series of election rallies in Wheeling, West Virginia
It is Trump’s first of five scheduled rallies in the coming week, including stops in places he’s fond of, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote on the nomination of the candidate he chooses for the vacancy in the Supreme Court has been put on hold, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming mid-term elections, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when voting in November.
What time does Trump’s rally in West Virginia start tonight and how do you watch online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, starts tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online through the live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to be talking about this week’s hearings for candidate Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who were extra-charged as Kavanaugh is accused of sexual misconduct and the Senate may wait a week to vote on his appointment while the FBI investigates the case.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to help the Republicans who are candidates for the November elections to get more elan.
President Trump’s campaign leadership said these five rallies are intended to “incentive volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” Reuters said.
“Congress control is so important to his program that the president is traveling to as many states as possible now that the busy campaign season begins,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
The rally tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be discussed in the Pittsburgh media, West Virginia Metro News said.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is left behind in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is ready to fight to keep hope alive in the run-up to Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, the foursomes of Saturday afternoon were perhaps just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging swing of opportunity is a fully invented sports concept, but it is one that players really believe in, especially in competitions like this one.
So who gets the best opportunities right now?
“They had a six-point lead at first, and now that’s only four more, so we find that luck is on our side right now,” said Jordan Spieth before leaving at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage of being four points ahead, while there are still twelve in the game.
The Americans find, as Spieth said, that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that give courage, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and scored three points each of the four.
Spieth has been a fearsome opponent of tea to green and he gives the good example.
The typical throat sounds he makes when he plays well became louder as his round progressed and he achieved a crucial pit with which match four became a success when he and Thomas were two points behind after two matches.
His putt with which they won the game at 15, was followed by a similar scream, the kind from which you can deduce that he believes the American team has not yet been defeated.
“You have to dig deep and only worry about your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all these players can do now.
18 holes to print your stamp.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
This remarkable but delicious European duo has four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
‘Moliwood’ was the only duo that didn’t play bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning, they avoided bogey’s.
As a result of that series, and the way they seem to exchange energy with their noisy audience, they are the players to be defeated on Sunday. If Fleetwood or Molinari wins, he will be the most popular player ever to win a European victory when the sun sets above Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time at different holes.
However, it is premature to speak of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly met Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of that morning, when he formed a duo with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine led to a backlog for the Spaniard and the Swede they no longer encountered.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you recover your backlog.
The four-balls and foursomes are so fascinating to see through the interactions between the duos, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
The European team has played the best so far and has a good lead in the run-up to the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that Team USA is willing to take on the fight, something that some, especially in the US, doubt.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts off with a nice lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup. After the four-balls and foursomes of Saturday, they stand for the United States with 10-6.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team with two victories more than Tiger Woods, who had a hard time, making them now have four points ahead in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who wanted the trophy she lost in Hazeltine two years ago, was stronger than the blundering Americans in the four-balls in the morning, with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, where it won two games, but was unable to catch up.
Jim Furyk's team must score eight points during Sunday's 12 singles matches in order to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed ‘Molliwood’, after a sensational weekend, are only the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup to win four points in their four opening games.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they were beautifully matched and defeated a disappointing Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, occasionally showed a brilliant move, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-balls and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, equipped for the four-balls of the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and together they defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three in the world, with 2&1.
Nevertheless, it did not run off a slate roof for Europe on this pleasant day with a breeze to the south-west of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who has already won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans on Saturday with three points.
They won after a difficult match with 2&1 from Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in the foursomes, after losing the first four holes.
It has only happened twice before in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has been able to catch up with a four-point backlash at the beginning of the singles, although Furyk's team has enough to equalize, as they currently hold the trophy.
But now that they have been in second place for two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems too high.
North Korea says it will ‘never’ disarm unilaterally without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions are causing more and more distrust in the United States and that under such circumstances, the country would not be able to unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN’s annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “important goodwill measures” in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear testing location, and vowing not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We don’t see a similar response from the United States,” he said.
“Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will in no case unilaterally disarm.”
Although Ri reiterated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to a “phased” approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded as it moves forward, it was noted that he did not reject unilateral denuclearization a priori, as Pyongyang used to do.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the very first summit between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim promised to work towards the “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea’s security.
North Korea is aiming for a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. urges ‘denuclearization first’ and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way and even by objecting to the ‘declaration of the end of war,’” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an air castle of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions only strengthen our distrust.”
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, something the US leader did last week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the other party were in this issue of denuclearization of South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such an impasse.”
Yet the tone of Ri’s speech was significantly different than last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean missiles would be targeted on the U.S. mainland so that after ‘Mr. Evil President’ Trump called Kim a ‘missile’ on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to completely destroy North Korea last year, promised Kim this year to the United Nations to take his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much still needs to be done and that the sanctions should remain until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for this: “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, that doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, however, told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The enforcement of the Security Council’s sanctions must be continued vigorously and firmly until we have achieved the full, final, verified denuclearization.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has implemented unanimous sanctions against North Korea to greatly reduce funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would go back to Pyongyang next month to make preparations for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
Almost a few hours after he left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, North Korea appealed to him about setting “gangster-like demands.”
North Korea promised this month during a meeting with Moon to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States were to take ‘consistent measures’.
He said Kim had told him that the “consistent measures” he wanted were security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore, and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students follow course on the importance of adequate rest
A new course at Harvard University this year ensures that all students get more sleep, in an effort to combat the growing macho culture in which it seems cool to study throughout the night and drink a lot of caffeine.
A professor noted that the students of the world’s largest university often have no idea of the basics of caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, set up the course, which is unique in the US as far as he knows.
He got the idea to start the course after giving a speech about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end of my speech, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why am I only hearing this in my last year?’
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep is, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
In the course, which is organized for the first time this year, students will be taught the basics of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance and how they also promote their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to organize the course when it was determined that students had a severe sleep deficit during the week.
The course lasts one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the parts, students see an image of a dorm room, where they click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise equipment and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light and the way sports performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of a routine when sleeping.
In another part, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of a heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Using a campus map, with interactive icons, participants are encouraged to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we find that they have the right to know all of this, just as people have the right to know what consequences the choice of cigarettes has on their health, Czeisler added.
The culture of pride on a night of study still exists, he says, and due to modern technology and the increasing pressure on students, sleep deprivation is an ever-increasing problem.
Ensuring adequate sleep, of good quality, must be the student’s ‘secret weapon’ to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation causes the brain to give them a constant feeling of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who is studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to prepare the course, because he had taken lessons with the professor last year when he was studying at Harvard in his first year.
He said the course had opened his eyes and had inspired him to make the course available to everyone on campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a similar study program before coming to the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set an alarm for their bedtime, and not just an alarm to stand up. They also need to be aware of the harmful effects of the ‘blue light’ of electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm, which can make you struggle to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal defeats Gerrard's men
The Rangers saw their away game once again disappointing as Dolly Menga scored and Steven Gerrard's weak team defeated 1-0 in Livingston.
The Ibrox team was hoping for a first win in a playoff since they defeated St Johnstone 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt's team made the defeat, barely the second of Gerrard as manager in 18 games. His team now has eight points behind Hearts, which extend further to the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers failed to score the equaliser.
The Rangers are now down to sixth place, Livingston rising to third, with only a difference in number of goals compared to Hibernian.
And the Rangers could get even more trouble, as border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after apparently an object was thrown at him by the supporters of the visitor team.
Gerrard made eight changes to his team, passing Ayr and going to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt stayed with the same team for Livingston, who the Hearts managed to score a point last week. He would have been thrilled about the way his well-trained team managed to block off the opponents at every move.
The Rangers may have had the most ball possession, but Livingston did more with it.
They should have scored after two minutes, when Menga dropped the ball for the first time and Scott Pittman had the goal of Allan McGregor in sight, but the midfielder couldn't finish it.
A deep free kick by Keaghan Jacobs reached captain Craig Halkett, but his fellow defender Alan Lithgow kicked against the rear pole.
The Rangers managed to take control, but they seemed to hope for a good outcome rather than really believing in it if they could approach the goal.
Alfredo Morelos at least found that he was entitled to a penalty kick when he and Steven Lawless clashed after a quarter of a game, but referee Steven Thomson waived the Colombian's request.
The Rangers were only able to shoot twice to the goal in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who was a former goalkeeper at the Ibrox, was able to easily stop Lassana Coulibaly's headball and the tame shot of Oviedo Ejaria.
Livingston’s opener in the 34th minute may or may not be in the length of the overall game, no one can deny that they deserved this, even if it was just for their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers were not up against Jacobs' deep playing pattern.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cold-blooded and chose Menga, who easily kicked the ball in the goal.
Gerrard caused a break with the change Coulibaly/Ryan Kent. This move had almost immediate consequences when winger Morelos passed, but an impressive Kelly raced away from his line to stop the ball.
But Livingston continued to force visitors to play a type of game that Livingston prefers, with Lithgow and Halkett continuing to kick long balls.
Holt's team could have increased its lead in the final phase of the game, but McGregor kept up well and blocked Jacobs, after which Lithgow came wide from the corner.
Invaller Glenn Middleton of the Rangers requested a penalty kick at the end of the game after an attack with Jacobs, but Thomson looked the other way.
Almanak: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from the almanac of our ‘Sunday Morning’: 30 September 1882, today exactly 136 years ago, for whom well can count... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm ‘Hans’ Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the geiger counter.
The geiger counter has since become an icon in pop culture, for example in ‘Bells or Coronado’, a 1950 film with unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: ‘What the hell is that?’
Rogers: ‘That is a geiger counter, which is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you set up these headphones, you hear the effect of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: “It’s really banging now!”
‘Hans’ Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains relevant.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ and kill malignant cells
Vaccine teaches immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells in a patient to change them into a lab
They can then ‘see’ a protein that often occurs in many types of cancer and are then injected again
A test vaccine delivers promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months
In the method, immune cells are removed in a patient, after which the cells in the lab are adjusted in such a way that they can ‘see’ the protein HER2, which is often found in all types of cancer, and then the cells are injected again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 ‘stimulates the growth of different types of cancer’, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colon cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar way to remove immune cells from patients and to ‘learn’ these cells to tackle cancer cells was found to work earlier in the treatment of a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West takes off pro-Trump tirade and wears MAGA cap after his appearance in Saturday Night Live.
That didn't go as he had hoped.
Kanye West was featured on a broadcast of Saturday Night Live after an incoherent performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he will be a presidential candidate in 2020.
After bringing his third issue of the evening, Ghost Town, with a cap on his head with the text Make America Great Again, he struck down a tirade against the Democrats and repeated that he supports Trump.
“Often when I talk to a white man, he asks, ‘How can you have sympathy for Trump now? He’s a racist!’
“If I were worried about racism, I’d been out of America for a long time,” he said.
The broadcast of Saturday Night Live began with a parody in which Hollywood star Matt Damon stabbed the dragon with the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate Committee on Justice in connection with the alleged assault of which Christine Blasey Ford accuses him.
West's tirade was not broadcast, but comedian Chris Rock uploaded it on social media.
It is not clear if Rock wants to stab the dragon with West with his post.
West also complained to the public that he had been taken backstage under fire for his cap.
“They put me backstage.
They said, ‘Don’t get on the stage with that cap.’
They've teased me!
And then they say I'm apathetic," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: ‘Do you want to see what apathetic looks like?’ He said that he would attract them superman-cape, ‘because that means you can’t command me. Do you want the world to get better?
Give me some love."
At least twice the audience shouted and the cast members of SNL seemed embarrassed, according to Variety. The magazine was heard by one present: ‘The whole studio was suddenly quiet.’
West was guest as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with a performance of the song I Love it while he was dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of our bravest minds: THANK YOU THE MASSA TROTS.”
But talk show presenter Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just ‘just herself, and that’s beautiful.’
“But I choose not to reward someone who supports and spews an ideology that harms my community (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’).
He's free to do what he wants.
We too," she added.
Before the show began, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name. From now on, he is, he says, ‘the being formally known as Kanye West’.
He is not the first artist to change his name, he was preceded by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Colleague rapper Snoop Dogg has also worn the name Snoop Lion and the late music legend Prince once changed his name to a symbol and then to The artist formerly known as Prince.
Accusation of attempted murder after stabbing in restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear in Belfast on Monday.
The accusation will be investigated by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington pulls out of toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role of swordsman Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor points out the stereotype of the macho hero and says that young boys often think when seeing such roles on the screen that they need to be tough to get respect.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes “something has gone wrong” and wondered how the problem of toxic masculinity should be addressed in the era of #MeToo.
Kit, recently married to his co-star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31 years old, admitted that he strongly believes the problem should be addressed.
“For me personally, this is really an important question right now: where has our masculinity gone wrong?” he said.
“What did we learn from men when they grew up, so that we are now faced with this problem?”
Kit believes that television could sometimes be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity, due to his very male characters.
He continued, “What is innate and what has been learned?”
What is being taught on TV and on the street that makes young boys think they should be a certain kind of man?
I think that’s one of today’s big questions: how do we change that?
“There is clearly something wrong with young men.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not act in prequels or sequels of Games of Thrones when the series ends next summer, because he is ‘ready with battlefields and horses’.
As of November, Kit will play in a revival of True West by Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he believes that his encounter with his wife Rose is the most beautiful result of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife during the series, so that’s how I kept my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the great love of Kits character Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that was awarded an Emmy.
The couple was married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reports that the number of Chinese with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health authorities say that more than 820,000 people have been affected by it in the country.
As early as the second quarter of 2018, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the diseases were passed on through sex, which was previously not the case.
HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China in the past due to transfusions of contaminated blood.
But the number of people living with HIV in this way is now almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, compared to the same period last year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV via sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has been no longer a criminal offence in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly widespread.
According to studies, an estimated 70 to 90% of men who have sex with men would eventually marry a woman.
Often, the diseases are transmitted through insufficient protection in sexual relations in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies staffing leaked data from Republican senators and calls for ‘dangerous lies’ and ‘complot theories’
U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters goes against allegations that one of her staff members has posted the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on the lawmakers’ Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat claims that the allegations are spread by “extremely right-wing” lawyers and websites.
“Legends, lies, and even more mean lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published data would include the private address and telephone number of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The data appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown in Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct at the address of Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court candidate.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, the IP address indicating the source of the posts was linked to the Waters office and contained the information of an employee of Waters, the Hill said.
“This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie,” Waters said.
“My employee, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false accusations, was under no circumstances responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly came across criticism online, including by former White House press officer Ari Fleischer.
“This denial sounds angry,” Fleischer wrote.
“From here you can see that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a Congressman.
If someone is accused of something he has not done, he should not get angry.
He shouldn't be rebellious.
He should not question the prosecutor's motives.
He must remain calm and serene.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters’ response to the Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of excessive anger at Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take over Waters' place in the midterm elections, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
“It’s cool, if it’s true,” he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had informed the relevant services and law enforcement agencies of these false allegations.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators become known,” she said, “and that they are legally held accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to my staff.”
Review: Johnny English Strikes Again - weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
In every new film with a British impact, we are now traditionally looking for references to Brexit, and that does indeed seem to apply to this revival of the Johnny English franchise, the comic action films starring a sloppy spy, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Does this airy evenatire become about how bad we are doing the latest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English with bulging eyes and flexible facial features manages to send everything in the hundred, also with his second comeback. From his name you can already conclude that he is a general comic character who was conceived for cinemagoers in countries where one speaks a different language than English.
He is, of course, the foolish secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to smooth glamour, a little Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a note from that guy who contributed one note to the theme number of Chariots of Fire during the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
He is originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man Atkinson once played in Barclaycard’s TV spots (which everyone has meanwhile forgotten) that always leaves a certain mess.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two beautiful moments.
I loved how Johnny English approaches a helicopter in his medieval armor and the rotor blades tap his helmet for a moment.
In this film, Atkinson can show how much talent he has for physical comedy, but the humor is rather weak and crazy enough excessive, especially now that the "serious" movie series like 007 and Mission Impossible itself include comedy as an ingredient, and do that well.
The humor seems more intended for children than for adults, and Johnny English’s dull disaster comes to me less original and focused than the jokes without the lyrics of the character Bean playing Atkinson.
The constant theme now is that Britain is in great difficulty.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super-secret spy network on the web, making the identity of all the active secret agents of Britain known, to great dismay of the agent in function, a unfortunately small role of Kevin Eldon.
That's the drop that makes the bucket run over from the prime minister, a pretentious woman with problems on her head and terribly unpopular as a politician. Emma Thompson does her best with this character that reminds of Teresa May, but the script doesn't provide much material to work with.
According to her intelligence advisers, she must employ a retired spy, as every active spy is compromised.
And that means the stunning Johnny English himself, who now works as a schoolmaster in a chic setting, but teaches unofficially about undercover work. Here are fun jokes in the story, because the espionage lessons from English remind us of School of Rock.
English is quickly summoned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former pathetic help Bough, replayed by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, and his wife is the captain of a submarine, a tumultuous and jovial role that is below Vicki Pepperdine's level.
The Batman and Robin of the disastrous conditions of Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's bloody femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister unfortunately falls for the charms of the charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve the British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of quirky doll fun: dressed as waiters, they set fire to a conspicuous French restaurant, kicking noise on board Volta's luxury yacht, and English unleashes pure anarchy as he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
For the latter, all registers are opened, but no matter how well intended and turbulent the scene is, she does something like children's television.
It's not all very original.
And as with the other films of Johnny English, I ask myself: can the British film industry really not think of a role that honors Rowan Atkinson’s talent?
Labour denies that the party is drafting a plan in which Britons work four days a week but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party would consider a radical plan in which Britons work four days a week but get paid for five days.
It is said that the party would want companies to pass on the savings they make as a result of the revolution of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) to their employees by giving them an extra day of vacation.
For example, employees can enjoy a three-day weekend, but still earn the same amount.
According to sources, the idea fits in the party’s economic agenda and plans to overwhelm the country’s balance in the direction of the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week was already approved by the Association of Trade Unions, which finds it a good way to ensure that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A high-ranking source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not happen from one moment to another, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits within the party's ambition to make the balance in the economy more pronounced for the benefit of the employees and that also fits within the party's overall industrial strategy."
Labour is not the first party to support such an idea, given that the Green Party has already promised a four-day working week in the 2017 national election campaign.
However, the effort is not yet supported by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: “A four-day working week is not the party’s policy intention nor is it considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used Labour’s conference last week to clarify his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of the “faceless drivers” and the “profiters” of utility companies.
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not recover the full value of their share, as a Labour government could apply “discounts” based on perceived misconduct.
He also confirmed that there are plans to include employees in the board of directors of companies and to create inclusive ownership funds that will give 10% of private sector shares to employees who can earn up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' whether FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court by at least one week, raising the question of whether the FBI’s findings could cause Republican senators to withdraw their support for the candidate.
In an interview broadcast Sunday at 60 Minutes, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover anything that could lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open in this than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I told the hearing that I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the accusation came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was resolute, determined, unequivocal.”
Graham's voice appears to be wall-locked.
"My opinion of Brett Kavanaugh is firm and the accusation should contain dynamite," he said.
"As for Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett has vigorously denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one named by her could verify it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don’t see any new developments.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York, an annual music event where a very impressive line-up of stars will take place and which has an equally impressive mission: the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh time again, tens of thousands of people will come to the Great Lawn in Central Park for the Global Citizen Festival. Not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to generate awareness for the real goal: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first organized in 2012, is an expansion of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international stakeholders who hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting against it.
Concertgoers who want to get a free ticket for the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP ticket) had to complete a series of tasks, or 'actions', such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or otherwise generating meaningful awareness for the goal: an end to poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been, with another 12 years to go to achieve this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a suitable way to convince people to demand a call for action or is this just another form of ‘clickivism’, giving people the feeling that they are making a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, more than 19 million “actions” of supporters have been registered, targeting a wide range of different goals.
According to Global Citizen, these actions have contributed to world leaders’ commitment and policy proposals worth more than $37 billion to change the lives of 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 initiatives and statements based on the actions, of which at least $10 billion has been paid or brought together by sponsorships.
The group estimates that the funds obtained so far have had an impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
One of the most important declarations of intent is that of The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executives from the UK with the aim of ‘helping children realize their full potential’. This group has pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the help of the British government, donors, other national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice that is undernourished a foothold in history,” said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, to the public at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that, after more than 5,000 actions were sent in which the UK government was asked to improve the food situation for mothers and children, the government has announced a project, the Power of Nutrition, to support 5 million women and children with food interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the Global Citizen website that asked, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
The group replied, "It will be a long and difficult road, where we will sometimes fall and fail.
But, just like civil rights and the anti-apartheid movements before us, we will ultimately succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the artists who will perform this year at the event in New York that will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use the Navy for a 'blockade' to hinder Russian exports of energy - Minister of Home Affairs
Washington may resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, said Ryan Zinke, the U.S. Secretary of State for Home Affairs, as stated by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria, where the country acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe they are only in the Middle East to be able to trade in energy, just as in Eastern Europe and the southern flank of Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to counter this.
"The United States has that capability, with the Navy, to ensure that the shipping routes remain open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not enter the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to attendees at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that portrays itself as the “voice of the energy consumer” in the U.S.
He went further and compared Washington’s approach to Russia with Iran’s approach, noting that these are not materially different.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less the use and replacement of fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as a country that knows only a ‘art’, with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is trying to boost the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a country that offers by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
For this reason, Trump government officials, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw its view from the “unsuitable” pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which according to Trump made Moscow’s “prisoner” according to Trump.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, will double its current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s powerful opposition to the project is directed only for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we agree with the view that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers themselves should be able to choose their suppliers,” said Aleksandr Novak, the Russian Minister of Energy, after a meeting with Rick Perry, the U.S. Secretary of Energy, in Moscow in September.
The US position has provoked a response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), the leading industrial organisation in Germany, has called on the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third power interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, the head of the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren “thinks seriously” about participating in the 2020 presidential election, Massachusetts Senator Says
Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Senator, said Saturday that she is "seriously thinking about it" to take part in the presidential elections after the midterm elections.
At a local meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she was thinking about taking part in the election.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington to restore the damaged government, and this also means a woman in the top position,” she said.
"After November 6, I will seriously think about putting myself eligible as president."
Warren ran against President Donald Trump during the meeting at the town hall and said he "sends this country in the wrong direction".
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been candid in her criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course, we need to wait for an FBI investigation before we vote on this.”
However, an opinion poll published Thursday found that a majority of Warren’s own supporters believe that she should not stand for election in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the “probable” voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not stand for election, according to an opinion poll by the Suffolk University’s Political Research Center and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent were in favour of being elected.
The study showed that there was more support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent ahead of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other names of prominent Democrats associated with possible participation in the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator from Vermont.
Biden said he would officially make a decision in January, according to a report from the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin’s PTSD at Donald Trump’s election meeting
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after serving in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“Because of what my own son has to experience, what he experiences now that he’s back, I have an understanding of other families experiencing the effects of PTSD and the injuries some of our soldiers return with,” she told the audience present at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about her son and other veterans "they come back a little differently, they come back and have become harder, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and the pilots and all the other soldiers have given for the homeland".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, interfering in a report on domestic violence and possessing a weapon under influence, according to Dan Bennett, police spokesman in Wasilla.
Washington, D.C. and 18 states support the protest against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal protest against a new policy in the U.S. that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and Washington, D.C., filed a statement last Friday as a “friend-of-the-court” to the Washington court in support of an asylum seeker who is contesting this policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace versus Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union filed against federal policy in August has not been disclosed.
She says her partner "and his violent sons who are members of a gang" abused her but that U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The lawyers of the states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of people who apply for asylum in the U.S., as countries that have major problems in terms of gangs and domestic violence.
The U.S.’s new asylum policy has reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals, which made it possible for immigrants without documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, the Attorney General of Washington, D.C., said Friday in a statement that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such an obstacle is contrary to that principle" is stated in the statement of the 'friend-of-the-court'.
The lawyers further argue that the policies that deny immigrants access to the U.S. harms the U.S. economy, as these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and provide the country with “necessary labour.”
Jeff Sessions, the Justice Minister, ordered judges in June to stop allocating asylum to victims of domestic and gang-related violence.
“Asiel is available to those who flee their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in its announcement on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems, even if these problems are serious, that people face every day, everywhere in the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of dead doubled in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was also getting worse.
“It feels very tense,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she tried to comfort her feverish baby in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute new bodies arrive in ambulances.
And clean water is scarce.”
Residents returned to their ruined homes and searched in their soaked possessions for valuables that they could still use.
Hundreds of people have suffered injuries and hospitals are overpopulated, as far as they are not damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale.
Some wounded, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the army hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside due to the chance of heavy aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes when he told about his feelings when the devastating earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed against the remains of a wall," Haris told a correspondent from the Associated Press, adding that he and his family were in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife calling for help, and later I heard nothing more.
I don't know what happened to her and our child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of 'Intimidation' with 'Propaganda Ads'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper put an ad of four pages in an American newspaper, which highlighted the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last referred to the paid annex of China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the most widely sold newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of interference in the U.S. congressional elections of November 6, an allegation denied by China.
Trump’s allegation that Beijing was trying to interfere with the U.S. election marked a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to pressure China, according to U.S. officials quoted by Reuters.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war, in which they have imposed increasingly higher import tariffs on each other.
China’s retaliation rates early in the trade war were specifically aimed at meeting exporters in states like Iowa, which support the Republican Party of Trump, as Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and previously long-time governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said China had hit U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
"China," as Branstad wrote in a Sunday's Des Moines Register opinion piece, "is now doubling the intimidation by publishing propaganda ads in our free press."
“By spreading this propaganda, the government of China uses the freedom of expression and of a free press, a long-held tradition in America by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at a kiosk in downtown Beijing, you will find in vain dissenting voices and you will not see a true reflection of the diverse opinions that the Chinese people may have about the difficult economic trajectory, because the media is firmly under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most prominent news outlets has refused to publish his article,” as he did not say at what news magazine this was.
By the Kavanaugh debacle, Republicans alienated female voters just before the midterm elections, analysts warn
Now that many important Republicans are rallying around Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, and defending him against various allegations of sexual violence, analysts warn that they will experience a setback, especially among women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this topic have risen enormously, and most Republicans have already announced that they want to continue with the vote.
“These things cannot be reversed,” Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article that appeared Saturday.
Reeher said he wondered if Senator Jeff Flake’s attempt to plead for an FBI investigation at the last minute would be enough to satisfy the angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, they haven’t forgotten it tomorrow and they haven’t forgotten it in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive MoveOn group on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. news magazine.
On Friday morning, protesters called out "November is coming!" during their demonstration in the Senate hall while Republicans who controlled the Justice Commission chose to approve Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
“The enthusiasm and motivation for the Democrats will reach a record high,” Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news site.
“People say it’s already high, and that’s true.
But it can go even further, especially among floating female voters in the suburbs and among younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who often don’t vote even though they don’t agree with the president.”
Even for Ford’s public testimony, in which she further explained her accusation of sexual harassment against the candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts suggested there could be a setback if the Republicans were to push through the nomination.
“This has become a confused mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former party president of the Republican Party, last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the vote in the committee, or about the final vote or that Kavanaugh is taking place in court, but it’s also about the way the Republicans have handled this and how they’ve treated her,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats be elected, on the news channel.
The Americans, however, appear to be divided on the question of who they believe after Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, with a small majority signing up for the latter’s side.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41% of respondents believe Ford’s testimony and 35% believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was certain or likely lying during his testimony while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake’s suggestion, the FBI is currently investigating Ford’s allegations and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted her under the influence of alcohol when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court has shown his genitals to her at a party during the time they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans a new internet to tackle Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of the technology legend, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which individuals have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that 'world domination' is the leading thought behind Inrupt.
"We have to do this now," he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to enable people to create their own ‘personal online data storage’ or POD.
It can store lists of contacts, activity lists, an agenda, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together through one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is the fact that it completely depends on the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data.”
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company provides the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, developers of technology around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team will not engage with “Facebook and Google about introducing a complete transformation that will turn all their business models upside down at once.”
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a post published on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the "mission (of Inrupt) is to provide the commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web, which is built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will remain as the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Spiritual and carrier of the Victoria Cross from WO I honored
The only clergy of the Church of England to have acquired a Victoria Cross during World War I as a military officer is honored 100 years later in his birthplace.
Lieutenant-Colonel, the Reverend Bernard Vann received the award following the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper and never knew that he had fallen to the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandsons during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was "brightly symbolic" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the fact for which his grandfather had been distinguished.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion on 29 September 1918 over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense fog and under fierce fire of field gun and machine guns".
He later stormed to the firing line and led the line forward before running alone to a field gun and turning off three members of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I can never tap on, but also something that makes me feel humble.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honored to play a part in the parade" and added that "the bravery of a real hero is evident from the support he receives from a large number of people".
Fans of MMA stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig in place
Imagine you’ve stayed awake all night to watch a full-blown Bellator 206 and you don’t get to see the most important moment.
The San Jose billboard featured 13 battles, including six in the main section, and this aired all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for their fight, viewers in the UK were unpleasantly surprised when the transmitter switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were outraged because they had stayed awake all night especially for this fight.
A fan described the move to the children's program on Twitter as "a bad joke".
“According to government regulations, after 6:00 a.m., content that is not suitable for children may no longer be displayed, and that’s why we had to switch to the children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig, yesss."
Scott Coker, business chairman of Bellator, said they are going to change their programming to ensure that viewers in the UK will also have a chance in the future.
"I think, in view of the return match, that we can solve this problem," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning here on a Sunday and we can't discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the switch, there were a lot of text messages going back and forth and believe me, these weren’t all equally friendly.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But that was not the case, it was a government problem.
I can promise you this won't happen a second time.
We limited the broadcasts to five nights instead of six, as we normally did, we tried to make it even better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “inferior” because of his sexual orientation
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he felt inferior during his youth because of his sexual orientation, but that this gave him the motivation to be successful.
The twenty-four-year-old said he didn’t realize until he went to secondary school that “not everyone is the way I am.”
In a conversation at Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken out about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that parenthood had helped him to gain less value during the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the long-running show, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Appearing as a shift on Laverne's first program, Daley said that during his youth he felt "less" than others because it was "socially not accepted to like both girls and boys."
He said, "To this day those feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different, are really existing facts that have given me the power to be successful."
He wanted to prove that he was "someone" so that he would not disappoint people if they finally found out his orientation.
The winner of two bronze Olympic medals has become a standout campaigner for the LGBT community and used his presence at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to make a call to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke out because he thought he was happy that he could live openly without further consequences and that he wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, whom he met in 2013 "has completely surprised me."
Daley was married last year to the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you have to endure so much," he took part in his first Olympic Games at the age of fourteen and his father died of cancer three years later, it's hard to find someone in your own age group who has experienced the same highs and lows.
The couple became parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me this question last year, I would have replied that it was all about winning a gold medal," he said.
“But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning gold Olympic medals.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie.”
His son has the same name as his father who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last things he had asked if they had already received the tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to be on the first row.
"I couldn't get it about my heart to say, you won't be there to sit on the first row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and not until his breathing actually stopped and he died, I could finally acknowledge that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I knew I had dreamed about this all my life, diving for a home audience during the Olympics, there's no better feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first music choice, Proud by Heather Small, that had seized him heavily on his way to the games and from which he still got goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs can be listened to on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in shape, on the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match in the Ryder Cup, but he must find his form to make it not a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who participated for the 12th time in the biennial event, a record, was placed by team captain Jim Furyk on the bench for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors divides the day between supporting his teammates and practicing on the driving range, in an effort to figure out what it’s up to.
Because he was never known even at the peak of his career for his straight drives, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the narrow fairways of Le Golf National, where the long grass of the roughs wandering balls routinely punishes.
And if the job itself isn’t frightening enough, Mickelson will face the ever-accurate Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who is linked to newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of the matches this week in the ninth match on Sunday.
If the Americans who are behind four points at the start of the 12 single matches start well, Mickelson’s match can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk has been shown to have confidence in this man, even though he could honestly find it difficult to do otherwise.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a slap on the back, hit his arm around me and said he's ready for it tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He has been inducted into the Hall of Fame and he has contributed so much to these teams, in the past, but also this week.
I probably didn’t expect him to play just two matches.
I expected more of it, but it's the way it is and it's the way we think we should act.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson can improve Nick Faldo's record for the highest number of Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It can also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he has never quite matched the highlights of his personal career.
Mickelson has won 18 matches, 20 lost matches and 7 equal games on his name, but Furyk said his presence had a certain intangible impact on the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's caught, he likes to get jokes out with people and he's a great guy to have on the team," he explained.
"I think the younger players liked to keep him crazy from time to time last week, which was funny to see.
He has so much more to offer than just his game.”
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that big lead can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the comfortable lead ahead of the single matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup, can easily turn into a less comfortable situation.
De Deen made his debut in the 1997 contest in Valderrama, where the team with Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead on the Americans, but eventually passed the finish line with the smallest possible margin: 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just," Bjorn said, calling here after seeing the 2018 citation win by 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, good for a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
So history shows me and everyone else in the team that this is not a game yet.
Everyone will have to make a full commitment tomorrow.
Get started and execute the plan on the right one.
It is not over until the points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that’s winning this trophy, and that’s what we need to keep focusing on.
I keep saying it, I focus on the 12 players we can have, but we are also aware of the people on the other side, some of the best players in the world."
Looking forward to the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never go ahead on business in this area.
A new challenge awaits tomorrow.
Tomorrow the individual performance will be discussed, and that is another very different discipline.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you stand alone, your abilities as a golfer are only really tested.
That’s the message you need to tell the players, try to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So now let your partner go and he must also get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform individually better than their partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who won three of the four points.
Furyk himself has experience with both sides of this kind of reversal on the last day, as a member of the winning team in Brookline and as a loser when Europe realized the 'Miracle of Medinah'.
"I remember every damn word of that speech," he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had tapped his players for the last day.
“We have 12 important matches for the bow tomorrow, but let’s try to get off to a good start, like in Brookline, or like in Medinah.
When we have the momentum, there will be a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We tuned our line-up on this and sent the men on their way in the order that we think is the best and, you know, we're going to try to magic something out of the high hat tomorrow."
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the counteroffensive and deploys Rory McIlroy for the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the first half of the battle.
“I chose this group in this order because I think we are so constantly covered,” Bjorn said of his selection of singles.
Germany's new warship delayed again
The latest frigate of the German Navy should have come into service in 2014, replacing the outdated warships of the Cold War era, but it will take at least one year before it is ready, due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the 'Rhineland-Pfalz', the leading ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting a military spokesman.
The vessel should have been part of the Navy in 2014, but the distressing problems after delivery have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 serve to replace the aged frigates of the Bremen class.
As far as we know, they have a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and a form of stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic characteristics.
Other important features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates up to two years in a row, far away from home ports.
However, the constant delays mean that the advanced warships, which are designed to allow Germany to project its power overseas, are already obsolete by the time they are put into operation, Die Zeit notes.
The fatal frigate F125 has already made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and sent it back to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons behind this return, but German media cited some crucial 'software and hardware defects' that would render the warship useless if it were deployed in a combat mission.
Software defects were especially important because the vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are served by a crew of about 120 sailors, half the manpower on the frigates of the older Bremen class.
It also became clear that the ship is suffering from a serious overweight, which will reduce its performance and limit the Navy's capabilities to carry out further upgrades.
The Rhineland-Palatinate weighs 7,000 tons, twice as many as ships of a similar class deployed by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price tag for the entire project, including the training of the crew, is already a problem.
It is said that this has reached a staggering €3.1 billion, compared to the original €2.2 billion.
The problems that the newest frigates have in their grip become extra important because of the recent warnings that the power of the German Navy is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the parliamentary defence committee in Germany, acknowledged that the Navy actually "has a shortage of deployable ships".
The official said the problem has grown over time as a snowball, as old ships were taken out of service but no replacement vessels were delivered.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were available to be included in the Navy.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Bats
New research conducted on an estate in the Scottish Highlands is trying to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
The hope is that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and contribute to future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, follows the common and small dwarf bats, the brown big oar bat and the water bat at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed in key locations around the estate to track the activities of the bats throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the cries of the bat and what kind of what does.
Next, a map of the habitat and a report are produced to create a detailed image on the landscape scale of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS nature conservation advisor, hopes that the results show which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as making meadows and how we can best maintain the forests for bats and similar species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the rest of the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect sleeping places and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, such as flycatchers and certain chemical treatments of building materials and attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind.
Due to their night hunting habits, however, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use an advanced echo location technique to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight path.
At the NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, bats are taken very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts, who conduct regular examinations, inspections of sleeping places and sometimes rescue actions.
The organization has even set up the first and only reserve for bats in Scotland at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of Scotland’s ten species of bats live.
Landscape manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal territory for the bats.
“Here in Threave we have a great environment for bats,” he said.
"We have the old buildings, many very old trees and the right habitat.
But so much is not yet known about bats and that is why the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
He stresses the importance of monitoring bats before maintenance work is carried out, as the potentially unconscious destruction of a sleeping place can lead to the death of 400 female bats and their boys, potentially eliminating a full local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass, or disturb them, or to destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust, has asked the public to make a contribution to help.
She said, “We still need to learn a lot about our bats and of many of our species we simply don’t know how their populations are going.”
Ronaldo rejects charges of assault as his lawyers prepare to prosecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo’s accusations of assault qualified as “fake news” and said people “want to promote themselves” by using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel, in which the allegations have been published.
The head of Portugal and Juventus is accused of assaulting an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is also accused of paying her $375,000 to remain silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Through a video for his 142 million followers on Instagram Live, Ronaldo, 33, called the reports “fake news” a few hours after the allegations were reported.
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they say today, fake news," says the winner of five Golden Balls on camera.
“They want to promote themselves by calling my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by calling my name, but that's part of the trade.
I'm a happy man, and through and through well," the footballer added, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit in which they want to prosecute Der Spiegel for the allegations they called “an inadmissible report of privacy suspects,” according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, a lawyer, said the footballer wants compensation for the “moral damage for an amount consistent with the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the football player's room, where he raped her anal according to the accusation, as can be read in the indictment filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and that he told her that he was a "good guy" for "99 percent," but that he is sometimes abandoned by "one percent."
The documents state that Ronaldo confirms that the couple had sex, but that this was mutually acceptable.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that photos of her injuries were taken in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an extrajudicial arrangement because she was "fearful of the consequences" and because she was concerned about the "public humiliation."
The 34-year-old now says she wants to have the scheme declared invalid because she has been permanently traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to go from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault and left this summer for Italian giant Juventus in a deal worth €100 million.
Brexit: UK ‘will regret it forever’ as automakers leave
The UK “will regret it forever” if it loses its status as a world leader in car production after Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister of Economic Affairs.
He added it was "careful" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily shut down production at the Burnaston factory, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit would cost jobs.
The plant in Burnaston, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis are made, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries in the European Union.
“My vision is that if Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of March, we will see production in our factory stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director at Burnaston.
Other car products in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed their fears about the consequences of leaving the EU without agreement for the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already announced that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Most car manufacturers are concerned about risks in the supply chain in the event of a ‘no-deal Brexit’.
Toyota’s production line is based on the “just-in-time” principle, whereby every 37 minutes parts from suppliers arrive in the UK and in the EU for cars that are made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there may be unrest at the borders that the industry believes can lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota cannot store more than one day of stock in the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production would be shut down in that case.
Clark said Theresa May’s Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU is “exactly aligned to avoid those border controls.”
"We need a deal. We want the best deal, which will not only enable us to continue the current success, but also seize this opportunity," he told the listeners of BBC Radio 4's Today program.
“The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, is that we absolutely need to be able to continue with these very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would be shut down, but warned in the long run that the additional costs would affect the company’s competitive position and that this would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years, and who is representative of Unite’s trade union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once these jobs have been lost, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump and Rosenstein meeting may be delayed again, the White House says
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed for “another week” as the fight over the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is investigating the Russian influence of the elections, links between Trump and Russia’s assistants and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump is going to fire the deputy attorney general and thereby jeopardize Mueller’s independence has been going on for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of carrying a microphone to record talks with Trump and to dismiss the president via the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, rumors spread that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then with the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he wanted to dismiss Rosenstein 'rather not', but then the meeting was moved to avoid a conflict with a hearing of the Senate Justice Commission, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, would both testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying the vote in the entire Senate.
On Sunday, Sarah Sanders, Trump’s chief press officer, appeared on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date yet set, it could be this week, but it could also be postponed for another week, given all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I always want to keep the press informed."
Some reporters had difficulty with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the scarcity of press conferences was not caused by an aversion to the “attentive” TV journalists, though, she added, “I will not deny that they are trying to draw attention.”
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president is doing more question-and-answer sessions than any president for him," she said, without providing any evidence for this: "We've looked at the figures."
Press conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the chance to ask the president of the United States directly, that is infinitely better than talking to me.
We try a lot to do that and you’ve seen us do that many times in the past few weeks and that will take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends public sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with only the president are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, he made a candid and at times bizarre appearance for the collected reporters.
Minister of Health writes a letter on Brexit to NHS Scotland employees from other EU countries
The Minister of Health has written a letter to the EU staff working in the NHS Scotland to express the gratitude of the country and the desire that they continue to work at the NHS after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter with less than six months to go before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish government has already agreed to bear the costs of applying for a permanent status for EU citizens working for decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued, and this autumn the expected decisions will be made.
But at the same time, the UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible scenario in which no deal is reached.
I know these must be uncertain times for all of you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of all staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring with them valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the NHS and provide benefits for the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
The Tennessee State Tigers linebacker, Christion Abercrombie, underwent emergency surgery yesterday after suffering a head injury in the 31-27 lost match against the Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ of the Tennessean.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the accident occurred shortly before rest.
"He came to the sideline and dropped more or less into it," Reed said.
The trainers and the medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen directly on the sidelines, before placing him on a stretcher and taking him for further examination.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of the operating room at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details are yet known about the type/size of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season at Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He was tackled five times on Saturday before leaving the field, making him tackled 18 times this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher rents when buying a house in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher rents when buying a house in the UK and the proceeds will be used to help the homeless according to new plans of the Conservatives
This action will have to neutralize Corbyn’s success to attract young voters
The increase of the empty is levied on persons who do not pay tax in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects this to raise <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher rents when they buy a house in the UK and the extra proceeds are used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn who attracts young voters with promises to provide more affordable homes and recount this on multi-deservers.
The increase in leges is levied on persons and firms who do not pay tax in the UK, with the additional proceeds being spent in an effort by the government to combat homelessness.
The surcharge, which comes on top of the current leases, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and houses purchased for the rental, can go up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year in this way.
An estimated 13 percent of the new building in London is bought by people who do not live in the UK, which drives up prices and makes it difficult for starters to get a foot on the house ladder.
Many affluent areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become practically 'spook cities' because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson had called for a reduction in the empty to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping prices high by buying land and not using it, and he called on May to abolish quotas on affordable homes in order to restore the “housing shame” in Britain.
Corbyn has announced a striking series of housing reforms, including rental ceilings and an end to “without negligence” expansion.
He also wants to give local governments more opportunities to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said that I wanted to spend my time as prime minister on restoring the ‘British Dream’, that life will be better for every new generation.
And that means that our defective housing market needs to be restored.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it may not be as simple for people who do not live in the UK, and for foreign companies, to buy homes here as it is for hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a house has become too vague a dream and the humiliation of life without a roof over the head is already too real.”
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland'
Jack Ross, Sunderland’s boss, says it’s his “ultimate ambition” to ever become manager of Scotland.
The Scotsman, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the club from the northeast of England, which is currently in third place in League One, on three points of first place.
He went to the Stadium of Light last summer after returning to the Scottish Premiership the previous season.
“As a football player, I wanted to play for my country.
But I was selected for the B-team and the suit was off," Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
“When I was a kid, I saw my father and I often play in Hampden Park and it’s something that keeps attracting me.
However, that possibility would only come if I was successful in managing a club.”
Ross's predecessors as managers of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he was not intimidated to become the successor to these established names at a major club, having previously refused advances from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me is currently measured by 'can I have this club return to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it should undoubtedly be in the Premier League,” he says.
“It’s not an easy task to achieve this, but I can only see myself as successful when I bring the club back there.”
Ross is only three years into his career as a manager, after a period as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the coaching group of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from degradation to the third division and transformed St Mirren from on the verge of degradation to winning the Championship in the next season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he ever did during his career as a footballer at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably really a crossroads," he recalled from the moment he took charge at Alloa.
“I really believed that management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds bizarre because I did the best I could, I deserved quite well and have known a few reasonable highlights.
Football can be tough.
There are a lot of things you are confronted with every week.
I still have that, given the stress and pressure of the profession, but management just feels good.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now that I’m real, I’m as good in my skin as I’ve never felt in my adult life.”

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, reveals research
The heat wave in the summer has increased revenues from British pubs struggling to survive, but has also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups with pubs and bars saw sales rise by 2.7 percent in July, but revenues in restaurants were 4.8 percent lower, the figures show.
Peter Martin, of the CGA business consultancy, who collected the figures, said: "Continuous sunshine and the fact that England participated in the World Championships longer than expected meant that July showed a similar pattern as June, when the pubs had 2.8 percent more turnover, with the difference that the restaurants were hit even harder now.
The fall of 1.8 percent in restaurant sales in June only got worse in July.
Pubs and bars focused on beverage sales performed by far the best, with better LFL growth (like-for-like) than that restaurants went down.
Pubs that are also focused on selling food members also from the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurants.
It seems that people just went out to drink.
In pubs and bars under management, beverage sales were 6.6 percent higher for the month, while food sales were 3 percent lower.”
Paul Newman of RSM, analysts for the leisure and hospitality industry, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors for sales in the entertainment market.
It is therefore no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a turnover drop of 4.8 percent year-on-year is particularly painful given the ongoing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the food-focused operators, and only time will tell if the more moderate temperatures of August can give the necessary respite.”
Total revenue growth in the pub and restaurant industry, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in the introduction of new brands.
In the Coffer Peach Tracker, the revenue monitor for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK, the performance data is collected and analyzed from 47 operational groups, with a combined turnover of <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion. This is the industry’s established benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social media account that keeps them hidden from their parents
One in five children, some not older than 11 years old, have a secret social media account that keeps them hidden from parents and teachers, a survey reveals.
Survey of 20,000 high school students revealed growth in ‘false Insta pages’
This news has reinforced the fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a ‘main account’ that they also show their parents
One in five children, some no older than 11 years, create social media accounts that keep them hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in the “false Insta accounts,” a reference to Instagram, the site for sharing photos.
This news has reinforced the fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of students say they use a clean 'main account' that they show to their parents while still having personal accounts.
A mother who accidentally found her 13-year-old daughter’s secret site discovered a teenager there asking others to “rape” her.
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and HMC (Headmasters and Headmistresses) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles and that half admitted keeping personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said: “It is disturbing that so many teenagers are lured into creating online spaces where they are not found by their parents and teachers.”
Eilidh Doyle becomes the 'voice of the athlete' in the Scottish Council for Athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of the Scottish Athletics World, as non-executive director at the general annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on the track and in the field, and chairman Ian Beattie described her election as a great opportunity for sports executives to learn from her extensive experience at an international level over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys a lot of respect in the athletics community of Scotland, the UK and the world and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland will greatly benefit from her election on the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said, “I am happy to serve as a voice for the athletes and I hope I can make a contribution and can help run the sport in Scotland.”
The American who won the 200 metres and the 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games, two of his four gold Olympic medals, and who now regularly comments on the BBC, could no longer walk after a TIA.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It’s been really hard work, but I’ve now fully recovered, I’ve learned to walk again and do my flexibility exercises again today!
Thanks for all the support!”
Breast pump ad comparing mothers to cows divides opinion online
A company that makes breast pumps has divided the online opinion with an advertisement in which nursing mothers are compared to cows being milked.
To mark the introduction of what is called “the most silent portable breast pump in the world,” Elvie, a consumer technology manufacturer, has released an ironic, music-video-inspired ad to illustrate the freedom this new pump has to offer to nursing mothers.
Four real moms dance in a hay-filled barn on a song that contains lyrics like: 'Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see anything' and 'In case you didn't notice, these are not onions, these are my breasts'.
The chorus then continues with: 'Pomps, pumps, pumps, I feed the babies, pumps, pumps, pumps, pumps, I milk the ladies'.
However, the ad, which was published on the company’s Facebook page, has directly caused an online controversy.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and has elicited hundreds of comments, especially mixed reactions from viewers, in which many people say that the “horror” of the dairy industry is being obliterated.
"A bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
Just like us, they should be expecting and giving birth to produce milk, but in their case, the babies are taken away within a few days of delivery" is written in a response.
Elvie's breast pump discreetly fits into a feeding bra (Elvie/Mother).
Someone else remarked: “This is naturally traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why don’t we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?”
Another added, “This ad is so far from reality.”
Others defended the ad and a woman admitted that she thought the song was "hilarical."
“I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
Those pumps made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little weird, but I haven't been looking for it too much.
“This is a brilliant product,” someone wrote.
Someone else had the following remark: “This is a funny ad, aimed at moms who are pounding (often in the workplace or in a toilet) and then feel like they’re just ‘cows’.
This ad is not at all positive or negative about the dairy industry."
At the end of the video you will see the group of women who are all dancing with the pump discreetly hidden in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who are bouncing sometimes feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or hoses and discreetly fits into a feeding bra, so that women have the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they’re on the go.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother says: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a tough and provocative introduction.
By making a comparison between mums and dairy cows, we wanted to put the plunger and the associated challenges in the spotlight and at the same time show in a entertaining and understandable way how the new pump will provide an incredible sense of freedom.
This isn’t the first time Elvie’s pump has made it to the front page.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on Marta Jakubowski’s catwalk while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has peaked, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and the harsh policies introduced by the Trump administration make it harder to accommodate children at sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants and are afraid to jeopardize their own chances of staying in the country by signing up for a child.
That risk has increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and the other adult members of their households should issue their fingerprints and that this data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs enforcement official, testified to the convention that his organization has arrested dozens of people who have signed up as a sponsor for unaccompanied minors.
The organization later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or family members of the sponsors are illegal in this country and a large part of them are criminal aliens.
We're trying to prosecute these people," Mr. Albence said.
In an attempt to process the children faster, officials have introduced new rules, forcing some of them to appear before the court within one month of the start of the detention, rather than within 60 days, which was previously the standard, according to the staff at the shelter.
Many of them will stand before the court through a video conference, rather than in person, to plead their application for legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed not eligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
The longer the children remain in custody, the greater the likelihood of them becoming anxious or depressed, which may give rise to violent outbreaks or flight attempts, according to the staff at the shelter and according to reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns are stronger at a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where the signs that a child is struggling are being ignored more often, due to the size of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can contribute to the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria orders U.S., France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Muallem also called on Syrian refugees to return, even now that the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also vice prime minister, said that foreign troops are illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that "this will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the Assembly.
According to Moualem, the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been uprooted and displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "this holy battle until we have liberated all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and from an "possibly illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish troops and Syrian Arabs fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem said the conditions are favorable for their return and he vowed to “distribute irrational fears” to some Western countries, leaving most refugees away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return,” he said.
“They are politicizing a case that should only be a humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be available for Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major stronghold of the rebels, has created the opportunity to start political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has repelled a large-scale attack by Russia-backed Syrian troops on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that this agreement has “clear deadlines” and said he hoped the military action will focus on jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who “will be exterminated.”
Staffan de Mistura, the UN representative, hopes soon to convene the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition to draft a constitution for post-war Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem made clear the conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee and said the work of the panel should be limited “to reviewing the articles of the current constitution” and he warned against interference from outside.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would win the 2020 election unless, as many “liberal” viewers are likely to hope, his presidency is prematurely terminated by a ousting procedure and scandals.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever.”
At the moment, however, there are no signs of vision fatigue.
Since 2014, CNN’s prime-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during prime-time, compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow Show is at the top of the ratings for cable programs with 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
“This is a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, the director behind the ABC drama Designated Survivor, a series about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced writer of comedy and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston for the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Scovell told me.
There is entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on TV, the storylines that come from Washington can influence the future of Roe v. Wade or determine whether immigrant families can reunite or influence the status of the world economy.
Switching off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond wanting to be a well-informed citizen, when you notice that you’ve been sitting for six hours watching a panel of experts discussing the use of sources from the ‘deep background’ by Bob Woodward in his book ‘Fear’, which is talking about Paul Manafort’s coat of peacock leather that has cost $15,000 (’a garment full of dismay’) by the Trump administration, according to The Times.
I will never be able to watch Super Mario in the same way again.
“What he’s doing to give you the idea that it’s a reality show is partly that he’s putting you on something new every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of Pawn Stars, about the rotating cast of the Trump show and the daily plot twists (going into a fight with the N.F.L., Kim Jong-un praise swings).
You can’t afford to miss an episode or you have the idea that you’re behind.
When I reached Fleiss earlier this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not get away from the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
“I remember doing all those weird shows not so long ago, and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now it turns out they were right."

Money from outside flows in the most exciting mid-term elections for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th District of Pennsylvania sees an influx of money, thanks to a redeployment of a constituency that requires two sitting representatives of the people to fight for the same seat.
Pittsburg's newly re-classified district meets Democratic People's Representative Conor Lamb, who has acquired his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb must face another sitting representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which has a lot of overlap with the new 17th district.
The cards were re-arranged after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally classified ('gerrymandering') in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a crackdown on campaign funding between the financial poor of the two major parties, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a nip victory in a well-considered special election for the 18th constituency of Pennsylvania.
This seat has been occupied by a Republican for more than ten years and President Donald Trump had conquered this district by 20 percentage points difference.
According to political experts, the Democrats have a small advantage.
The U.S. Considered Punishing El Salvador for Support to China and Rejected It
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing and had received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with Panama’s President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and he owned a hotel in Panama until his partners put out the management team of the Trump Organization.
U.S. foreign ministry officials have decided to recall U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the “recent decision to no longer recognise Taiwan,” said Heather Nauert, the ministry’s spokesperson, in a statement earlier this month.
But only penalties were considered in the case of El Salvador, as the country received $140 million in US aid in 2017, for control of narcotics, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with high unemployment and high murder rates.
As internal meetings continued, North American and Central American officials held a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from leaving the United States.
But in mid-September, some top government officials announced that they wanted the conference to continue, thereby making all possible punitive measures against El Salvador impossible in advance.
The plan is now that Vice President Mike Pence will give a speech at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the government assigns to the meeting, diplomats say.
And the three U.S. envoys have returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any further fuss, with no hard messages about Washington’s punitive measures.
A White House spokesman on behalf of Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal discussion on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is also close to the government and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Study the history
The next step could be the report of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible counter-action of Trump’s justice, for which heavy evidence has now become publicly known.
Mueller is also likely to focus his research on collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia in an attack by Russia on our elections.
If Congress changes color, Trump must answer for that institution, just as he gets ready to turn to the voters again, and perhaps he must answer for a jury in a court of law.
That’s a lot of thinking, and I don’t want to suggest that Trump’s fall is inevitable, nor that of his equivalents in Europe.
Choices will have to be made by all of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, who will determine how long the battle will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, but only if the West had resisted and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We therefore failed and missed an opportunity to prevent the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history revolves around such bending points and the relentless advance of democracy is thereby accelerated or delayed.
Americans are currently faced with several of these types of bending points.
What will we do if Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man in charge of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since the time this magazine reported that he had suggested, last year, to secretly record talks with the president and that he had speculated about the president’s suitability for his office.
Rosenstein says the Times report is not correct.
"How will we respond if the FBI's new inquiry into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or not fair, or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite credible charges of assault and an unfair testimony?"
And above all, are we going to vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail in these tests, democracy awaits a very long winter.
But I don't think we'll fail because of the lesson I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jewess who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassador’s home.
She survived it, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me away to light candles for the Sabbath on that table on which a swastika is depicted.
With that as my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the match against Rapid Wien
Rangers get Rapid Wien to visit on Thursday and know that a win over the Austrians, after the impressive tie in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, puts them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury, midfielder Graham Dorrans could not play his first game of the season until the 2-2 tie at Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use that score as a springboard to better results.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal really has a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We went into the game with the idea that something was going to win and the game came out with a point.
Maybe we could have even won at the end, but seen throughout the game, an equal game is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half but when we came out in the second half we were the better team.
Next Thursday is a new big European night.
Hopefully we can score three points but it will be a difficult game because they also had a good result in their last match. But if the audience is going to stand behind us, I am sure that we can push through and that we can achieve a positive result.
Last year has certainly been tough, from everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there’s a feelgood factor on the club.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it. The training is good.
Hopefully we can push through now, leave the last season behind and be successful again.”
Women can’t sleep because of fear of retirement
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they want to receive care, few people discuss this with their family members.
About half of the participants in Nationwide’s research said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
And only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take the steps necessary to conduct this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here we start.
Talk to your spouse(s) and the children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care if you don’t make your wishes known well in time.
Work with your advisor and family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Take a financial advisor into your arms: Your advisor can also give you advice on how to pay these expenses.
Your long-term care financing choices may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or using equity as insurance, as long as you have money.
Set up your legal documents: Avoid legal battles when the insurance needs to be used.
Provide a health care proxy so that you can designate a trusted person who can oversee your medical care and ensure that the professionals adhere to your wishes in case you can no longer communicate.
Also consider a power of attorney for your financial affairs.
In that case, you select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that the invoices are paid if you can no longer do so yourself.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother has a medical emergency and is on their way to the hospital.
If so, can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Capture these details in a written plan so that you have the information at hand.
“It’s not just the financial matters that matter, but who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
"What medications are used?
Who takes care of the dog?
Make sure that plan comes out.”
Man shot several times with air pressure rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air-pressure gun when he walked home after a night out.
The victim, forty plus, was in Oxford Grove near Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was hit in his chest, abdomen and hand.
Agents described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "random act."
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
His injuries are not life-threatening and police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise further.
Because the means of communication have been disabled, the official authorities have not yet received information from the regency Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the quake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster took place.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central-Celebes and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency stretching over more than 300 km along the coast of northwest Celebes.
The regency, an administrative region just under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main activities in the economy of the province of Central-Celebes, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been regularly hit by tsunamis over the past hundred years, according to the Agency for Combating Disasters of Indonesia.
In 1938, a tsunami claimed more than 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck in western Donggala in 1996, killing nine.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the most severe earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Atjeh on north Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries and claimed a total of 226,000 lives along the coasts of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which occurred in Atjeh.
2005: A series of heavy earthquakes took place on the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.8 on Richter's scale took place south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, causing a tsunami that struck the south coast and claimed nearly 700 lives.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 on the Richter scale struck the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were found dead.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 on Richter's scale struck one of the Mentawai Islands off the coast of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed around 300 lives.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie regency in Athens and caused destruction and panic, as people were reminded of the devastation of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people found their way to death by collapsing buildings.
2018: Several earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska and vice-presidential candidate, has been arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and providing opposition during the arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged offense, he took the phone off of her.
Palin is being held in custody in the house of custody Mat-Su with a $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "innocent, sure" when asked to do so, the network reported.
Palin is charged with three Class A violations, which means that he can be sentenced to one year in prison and up to a fine of $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B violation, which is punishable by a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
It is not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017, he was accused of abusing his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, then called the police to report the alleged abuse.
This case is now before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic abuse, interference with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under the influence of the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he had slapped her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a veteran group in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent behavior to PTSD, which he would have left to serve in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Richter’s scale has led to a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been disabled while the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake took place just next to the center of Celebes, located northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
There are videos circulating on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York demand the death penalty for Sajfoello Sajpov, the suspect of the terror attack in New York City, where eight people have been killed, a rare punishment that has not been implemented in this state since 1953.
Sajpov, 30, according to the indictment, used a hired truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, reversing pedestrians and cyclists who came on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Sajpov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and “intentionally” inflicted serious bodily injuries, according to the letter of intent demanding the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
The death penalty is possible for both charges, according to the document submitted to the court.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury approved the charge with 22 charges, including eight charges of murder for a racket, typically a charge used by federal prosecutors against organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and preparation” according to the prosecutors, and they described the way in which Sajpov carried out the attack as “cruel, cruel and corrupt.”
Sajfoello Habiboellaevich Sajpov has inflicted injury, damage and loss on the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been more than ten years since a case was filed in the Southern District of New York demanding the death penalty.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after two years before being convicted of espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by means of the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Sajpov, who came from Uzbekistan, did not show any remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to the court documents.
He let the detectives know that he felt good about his act, be it the police.
Sajpov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his room in the hospital, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the charge with 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Sajpov, said he is “naturally disappointed” with the prosecutor’s decision.
"We think the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt in exchange for a life sentence without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all concerned," Patton said.
Sajpov's defense had previously asked the prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MP Says NIGEL FARAGE Should Lead Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to mobilize a “people’s army” during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former leader of Ukip said politicians should feel the “heat” of the Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May’s own MPs suggested that he lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the participants of the march in Birmingham that the UK would be “out” if Mr. Farage had been Brexit minister.
But the challenge that May faces in reconciling the highly divided ranks is highlighted by two conservatives who are pro-Remain and who participate in a separate protest rally against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise on the road while it is being attacked by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Fellows insisted that she will continue and will try to make a deal with Brussels despite the setbacks, forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Bone said at a meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he "want to throw Chequers into the trash."
He suggested that Farage should be knighted and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he quit the service, we'd be out now," Bone said.
The MP for Wellingborough added: “I will support Brexit, but we need to throw Chequers in the trash.”
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he said: “We have not fought in two world wars to be subordinate.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone pointed out suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely untrue."
Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march and told reporters: “I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition does not vote, it is unpopular within our party and with our activists who go door-to-door and make sure we are elected.
Drop Chequers and listen."
In a targeted message for May, she added: “Premiers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage told the meeting that politicians should “feel the heat” if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to say to them, ‘We won’t let you get away with this.’
In a message to the enthusiastic masses, he added: “I want you to shine a light on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
We are mobilizing the national army of this country that has given us victory in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we have again become an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom.”
In the meantime, Remainers marched through Birmingham and concluded this march with a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved flags on which Tories Against Brexit stood, following the establishment of this group on the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour High Court, joked about the security issues of a Conservative party app at the start of their conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can provide IT systems and all technology for Canada plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to ‘think well’ about presidential candidacy
Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would “think well about her candidacy for the presidency” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat told about her future at a meeting at a town hall in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, wants to be re-elected in November against Geoff Diehl, Republican delegate who co-chaired the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She has been the center of speculation that she might be struggling with Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump came to power.
One present asked her if she would be eligible for the presidency.
Warren replied that it is time for women to go to Washington to restore our defective government and that includes a woman at the top.
Arrest after shooting of Wayde Sims from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday that a suspect was arrested after killing Wayde Sims, LSU basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at an ET press conference at 11:00 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting incident on Friday and asked for help identifying the man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound in the head and died from the consequences," police commander Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson has been questioned and has been known to have been present at the scene of the crime, to have been in possession of a firearm and to have shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson has been arrested without further incident and is being held in custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a 1.98 metre junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games and started last season in 10 games. He had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after Sebastian Vettel has left him the victory after orders from team
When Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that team orders from Mercedes would play a role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from pole position and left Hamilton almost completely in the cold when he defended his position and Vettel invited his teammate to attack.
Vettel went into the pits and let Hamilton drive in the busy tail of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the pits a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back on the head after a wheel-on-wheel action which forced the Ferrari rider to reluctantly release space on the inside after a double movement in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from last place and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he was the leader of the race for a while, because he stayed with his tyre choice and aimed for a quick finish so that he could catch up with Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
Eventually he went to the pits in the 44th round, after he could not increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen became fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did his best all weekend. He was a real gentleman and left me by.
The team has done its best for the places one and two," Hamilton said.
It was not a good body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at an election meeting on Saturday about the fact that she failed to be the source of Christine Blasey Ford’s leaked letter, in which the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, was accused of assault.
Speaking at an election meeting in West Virginia, the president was not directly talking about the testimony given by Ford to the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead stating that what happened in the Senate showed that people can be "common, unkind, and untrue."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful show that is taking place in the Senate in the last days, when you see the anger, when you are the people who are angry and mean and mean and mean and unkind and untrue," he said.
"When you look at the press releases and the leaks and then say 'oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you play?
Do you remember her answer... did you read the document... 'oh, oh, what?
- Oh, no.
I didn't play."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn't," he added, in an imitation of the senator.
In July, the letter in which Kavanaugh's allegations were reported to Feinstein was sent by Ford and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that her desk was leaking.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't read her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to deal with it confidentially and I treated it confidentially, as she had asked."
But the president turned out to not believe her denial and he commented on it during the meeting on Saturday night: "I'll tell you something, that wasn't a good body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the president suggested that the Democrats used the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take back power, with all the necessary means.
You see the commonality, the dishonesty, they don't care who hurts them, who they have to drive to seize power and regain control," the president said, according to a report by Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants: 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars have made up the loss of Friday in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return match with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had names with two goals led by scores of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took the home team by the side before Dwyer led the Giants back in the lead.
Francois Bouchard made the equaliser for Dundee, before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two goals.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for the men of Adam Keefe, who had to make up a gap on Friday night to then defeat Dundee by 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth time this season that the two teams met, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on an assist from Kendall McFaull. David Rutherford gave the assist with which Beauvillier doubled the lead, four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt gave the lead for Cownie's equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants took the first rest with a head start, when he made his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team repackaged and Bouchard put them back on an equal footing with a power-play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game, late in the second period. He took care of the victory with the fifth goal for his team, halfway in the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies while making sure hundreds of people can escape the earthquake in an airplane
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is honored as a hero after he died because he made sure that a plane with hundreds of people on board could safely take off.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are still missing after a severe earthquake hit the island of Celebes on Friday; an earthquake that subsequently caused a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks still plague the area and many are buried below the point in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild-and-weather moving traffic gates of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He continued to ensure that flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was ready for takeoff at the time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the traffic gates when he thought it was on collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News reported from Australia.
We had arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning, before the helicopter reached Palu.
“It breaks your heart when you hear it,” he added.
In the meantime, authorities fear that the death toll may rise to thousands, and the country’s disaster response agency said that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the death toll is still rising because many bodies were under the rubble and have not yet been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves reaching a height of six meters have devastated Palu, where a mass funeral ceremony will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute, bodies are brought in by ambulances.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being plundered everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is involved in a race to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the soldiers present: “I call on all of you to work day and night so that all the tasks necessary for the evacuation are completed.
Are you ready?” CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says one man is missing after a crash in the lagoon
The airline carrying out the flight that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says one more man is missing after reporting earlier that all 47 passengers and crew had safely left the sunken plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that on Saturday afternoon one male passenger is missing.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to the questions for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane got watered during the landing at the airport of the Chuuk Islands.
The authorities announced on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that everyone’s condition was stable.
What caused the crash and what is the exact order of events remains unclear for now.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say the plane landed in the lagoon and missed the runway.
Some witnesses say the plane was shot across the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was approaching the airport very low.
"That's good news," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and several others succeeded by wading to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the stewardesses were panicking and screaming and that he had a non-serious head wound.
The U.S. Navy announced that sailors who were in close proximity to work on a yard also helped in the rescue work by bringing people to the coast with an inflatable boat, before the plane sank further into the about 30 meters deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have been found dead in crashes of airlines registered with the PNG over the past twenty years, but that none of them relates to Air Niugini.
Analyst sets the timeline of the night a woman is burned alive
The prosecutor closed his requisition on Friday in the reopened trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, gave a few hours of testimony as a witness expert in the field of information analysis.
He made clear to the jury how he had used cell phone call data to capture the movements of 29-year-old suspect, Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, in the night she died.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was at Chambers on the night of her death, which contradicted his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went back to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was standing in the witness stand on Saturday and told that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he told him he was in his truck at Sanford during that night, Sanford said he lied because my truck was in Nashville then.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis had told him that he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The mobile phone data indicated that they only knew each other for one week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis erased his phone's text messages, calls, and contact details.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense begins Sunday with the final arguments.
The judge said he expects the jury to begin the deliberations later that day.
The High Breed: What is 'conscious hip hop'?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol state that hip hop is alienated from its origins with political opinions and addressing social problems.
They want to return to the roots and make ‘conscious hip hop’ again popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a revival in Britain by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
A New York-based children's maid challenges a couple to court because of a 'racist' text
A New York-based granddaughter challenges a couple to court for dismissal for discriminatory reasons, after receiving a wrongly sent text in which the mother complained about "again such a black one."
The couple denies being a racist and calls the lawsuit "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed her dismay when she discovered that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, turned out to be a Negroid woman when she met her on her first working day in 2016.
“NOTEEE AGAIN SO’N BLACK,” Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it twice to Mrs. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt uncomfortable, fired Mrs. Maurice when she realized her blunder, declaring that their previous childhood wife, who was African-American, had done bad work, and that she had therefore expected a Filipino.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a working day and was then sent home by taxi.
Now Maurice challenges the couple to the court to get a compensation of $350,-- per day for the 6 months for which she was hired to bivouac internally with the family, albeit without a contract.
“I want to make them feel like you’re just not doing something like that,” Maurice said in the New York Post last Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple resented the claim that she was a racist by saying that it was reasonable to dismiss Maurice after they were afraid, by insulting her, that they could no longer trust her.
"My wife sent her a message that she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," husband Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone who insulted you, even if it was by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Fuck off.'
Comparing the lawsuit with “extortion,” Plasco said his wife expected a baby in two months and was “in a very difficult situation.”
"Are you going to prosecute someone like that?
That's not so sympathetic," the investment banker added.
While the trial is still ongoing, public opinion is quickly on hand to capitalize on the couple on social media, where she is being held accountable for their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington publishers feared that the public would not have much interest in a talking bear, reveals newly discovered letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book’s approval, said of the letter: “It’s hard to get in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time, even before the first publication.
With what we now know about Paddington’s huge success, it’s very entertaining.”
She told that her father, who, before he was inspired to write the children's book about a small toy bear, as a cameraman working at the British broadcaster BBC, was optimistic about whether his book would be rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book felt "bittersweet" after his death last year.
About Paddington, who she describes as "a very prominent member of the family," she said her father was secretly proud of her ultimate success.
She said, "He was a quiet, modest man."
"But because Paddington was so lifelike for him, it almost looked like a child's achievement; you're proud when you've done nothing for it yourself.
I think he was about to experience Paddington's success.
Although Paddington was the creation of his own imagination, he honored the bear himself for success.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her by phone
Immediately after the landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad had called several times to say that it looked very bad and that she was expected not to make it," Ms. Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then Nad's phone call came to say that she would die within two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
We'll be back soon.
Then I'll be with you again.
The drugs the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping slowly became elaborated and left her body.
She had died some time before and this process eliminated everything further.
I could only sit there knowing what was going on.
I couldn’t complain, scream or cry because I was in the middle of all sorts of people and families.
I had to keep myself really big.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the death of her daughter, stepped on the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what trial she was going through.
"Nobody knew," she said.
“I sat with my head down and the tears just kept coming.
It’s hard to explain, but during the flight I got an overwhelming sense of compassion for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Routine women paste messages on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who are lost to their loved ones by suicide make strong efforts to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys stick inspiring messages and phone numbers that people in need can call for help on a bridge in Wales
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he first became depressed and he committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Ms. Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney, Gloucestershire, England, says her son was a promising chef with a contagious grin.
“He was known for his smile.
It was always said that his smile lit up every room.”
Still, he stopped working before his death because he was deep in the pit.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found him after he had robbed himself of life.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried about a chain reaction coming."
Mrs. Davis made the cards; "to let people know that there are others where you can go and where you can talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don’t be silent, talk about it.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark who was her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he felt sad or depressed or something,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He sat all the way to the ground on Christmas Day - when the kids unpacked their presents he didn't look at them at all or anything."
She said that his death was a major trauma to her, but that they had to deal with it: "It's tearing the whole family apart.
It's driving us apart.
But we all have to go on and keep fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's Future Uncertain as FBI Investigation Begins
"I thought that if we could indeed get what he is asking for, a study limited in time and size, we might be able to create a little more unity," Mr Flake said last Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee was falling apart, amid a firmly entrenched pacing within the party.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance has everything to do with timing.
The midterm elections are already in five weeks, on 6 November and if, as expected, the Republicans are doing poorly, their efforts to get their husband elected to the highest court in the country are seriously hampered.
George W. Bush has already called with members of the U.S. Senate to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and thus got to know his wife Ashley, who the Bush was his personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI completes the report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently in session.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can count on at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that would allow Mike Pence, vice president, to cast the decisive vote to confirm Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court.
Number of defectors in North Korea 'down' under Kim
According to a South Korean lawmaker, the number of North Korean defectors has fallen to South Korea since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong suction, which quotes from data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, states that there were 1,127 defectors last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park notes that stricter border controls between North Korea and China, and higher penalties for human traffickers, are the main factors for the decline.
Pyongyang has not responded in public.
The vast majority of the defectors from North Korea are eventually offered South Korean nationality.
According to sources in Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest outer border with North Korea and where you can make the crossing easier than in the heavily secured demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers the defectors to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often deploys them by force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still formally in a state of war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, mainly talking about the stagnant negotiations on denuclearization.
This meeting took place after the historic meeting between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un, in Singapore in June, agreeing broadly to work towards the nuclear dismantling of the Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the U.S. of the lack of progress in lifting U.S. sanctions since then.
"Without faith in the actions of the United States, confidence in our national security is also lacking, and under these circumstances there is no first step in unilateral disarmament," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and finds him unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, President of the House of Representatives, called the U.S. Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," and found him incapable of serving in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview, Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help thinking that if a woman were to behave like that, they would call her ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Committee on Justice on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional; he sometimes almost screamed and was especially upset when he told about his family and his high school years.
He also emphatically condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him “great and coordinated character murder,” organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi stated that she found that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was not fit to serve the Supreme Court because he was full of prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way he talks about the Clintons and the Democrats," Pelosi said.
Pelosi protested when she was asked if she would try to institute impeachment proceedings against Kavanaugh if he were to be appointed, and the Democrats would get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I can say this about it; if he does not tell the truth in Congress, or against the FBI, then he is not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he now serves," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the District of Columbia District Court (usually abbreviated D.C.) District Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned that Kavanaugh would go against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade, because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh asked questions about reviewing certain decisions of the Supreme Court during the confirmation hearings.
“Don’t expect us to stand up and cheer when a hysterical, prejudiced person is appointed to the Supreme Court,” Pelosi said.
Women just have to admit this.
It is a just tirade of months and years of tangled anger that overflows, and she can only cry to get it out.
“We’re going to cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's weird, do you?"
She continued: 'I was greatly helped by a woman who was in charge somewhere and who told me that she too was going to cry when she got angry. She developed a method in which she was going to cry whenever she got angry. To the person she spoke to, she said, 'You may think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept crying.
I just thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are partially allowed as an expression of anger, because crying is essentially misunderstood.
One of my best-kept memories from a former job, in a male-dominated office, is when I had to cry terribly because I was extremely angry. An older woman, a cool business leader who everyone was a little afraid of, grabbed me in my neck and dragged me into a stairwell.
"Never let them see you crying," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and are glad they got you on the closet.
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of Congress in Colorado for the Democrats, had worked for Gary Hart on his candidacy for the presidency.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was involved in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called 'Monkey Business' (informally meaning 'cat' or 'open-air') and withdrew from the race, the deeply disappointed Mrs. Schroeder felt that there was no reason why she would not be a candidate.
"It wasn't an informed decision," she told me 30 years later laughing.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone was talking about "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
As the campaign was already advanced, she was behind fundraising, and so she vowed not to participate if she couldn’t raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who would give men $1,000, wanted to give her only $250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” she asked.
When she gave her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings—of gratitude to the people who had supported her, of frustration because the system made it so difficult to raise money, and reach voters instead of delegates, and of anger about sexism—that she stuck in it.
"You'll think I got a nervous breakdown," Mrs Schroeder recalled about how the media reacted to her.
"They would have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will they put on my gravestone?
"She was crying?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The opening salvos of the trade war between the US and China were deafening, and although the struggle has not yet been fought, a long-term gap between the two countries could, according to experts, favor Beijing.
Donald Trump, the US president, issued the first warning earlier this year by raising taxes on major Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation was announced this week when new effective, increased tax rates were revealed for $200 billion (€150 billion) in goods; half of all goods coming from China were US.
Beijing has taken in kind reprisals every time, most recently by raising tariffs from 5 to 10% for $60 billion in US goods.
China has pledged to match the US every time, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to blink its eyes fast.
In order for Washington to bend, requests must be granted, but publicly bending for the US is far too painful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts claim that if Beijing plays smart, the trade war with the U.S., China could support positively in the longer term, as the interdependence of the two economies decreases.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that could put one of the two countries in an economic free fall is actually far more dangerous than spectators have previously acknowledged," said Abigail Grace, a research associate at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank specializing in national security issues, which focuses on Asia.
Syria 'ready' to allow refugees to return, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country devastated by a more than seven-year war.
During his speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that conditions in his country improved.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism,” he says.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists, and to normalize the situation on the ground.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that threatened their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
It is estimated that six million people are still living in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in restoring the devastated country.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that had subsidized the uprising.
Europe wins the 'Ryder Cup' in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on the golf course 'Le Golf National' southwest of Paris in France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil, and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the team of Danish leader Thomas Bjorn scored the required 14.5 points to defeat the US.
The star of the American team, Phil Mickelson, who was wrestling almost the entire tournament, dropped his long stroke from the tee into the water at par 3, hole 16, and conceded his loss to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, excelled in all his rounds and became one of the four players who ever scored 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was thrown out by playing the lowest score of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, with 5 holes down and 4 holes.
The top-ranked player in the world ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 holes down and 1 hole to Ian Poulter from Great Britain, who possibly played his last match in the Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Segrio Garcia, veteran with eight Ryder Cups, became the best European player of all tournaments ever with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't cry so fast, but today I can't do anything about it.
It's been a difficult year.
I am so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad we got the cup back.
It’s about the team, and I’m glad I was able to help,” Garcia said after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot, John Ram, who defeated American legend Tiger Woods with 2 holes down and 1 hole in the game for singles on Sunday.
“The enormous pride I feel because I defeated Tiger Woods, and I kept following that guy when I was growing up,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic from one of the greatest players of all time; winner of 14 major championships, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled the weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at high level throughout the tournament.
The U.S. captain, Jim Furyk, said after the disappointing performance of his team, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we made Europe a little more difficult.
We resisted.
All respect for Thomas.
He's a great leader.
All 12 players in his team played very well.
We're going to regroup. I'm going to work with the American PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're looking ahead.
I love these 12 boys and I am proud to be their leader.
You have to take your hat off to the opponent.
We're overplayed."
Red glow update: Concentrations decrease in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The most recent report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (Florida Commission for the Conservation of Fish and Fauna) shows a general decline in concentrations of Red glow in parts of the Tampa Bay Area (located on the west coast of Florida in the US).
According to the committee, reports are on fragmentary increases in the Red glow in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which could indicate a decrease in concentrations.
The Red glow extends over an average of 200 km of coastline, from northern Pinellas to the southern Lee counties.
There are spots about 16 km off the coast of Hillsborough County, but in less places than last week.
Red glow has also been seen in Pasco County.
Medium concentrations have been reported off the coast of Pinellas County over the past week, low to high concentrations off the coast of Hillsborough County, background to high concentrations in Manatee County, background to high concentrations at or off the coast of Sarasota County, background to high concentrations in Charlotte County, background to high concentrations at or off the coast of Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
There are ongoing reports of airway irritation in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier.
In northwestern Florida, no reports of airway irritation were reported in the past week.
