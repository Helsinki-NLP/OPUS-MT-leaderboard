A Republican Strategy to Face Obama’s Re-Election
Republicans’ leaders justify their policies with the need to fight election fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth by affirming that election fraud in the U.S. is less common than the number of people killed by lightning strikes.
Republicans’ lawyers have reported only 300 cases of election fraud in the United States in 10 years.
One thing is for sure: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for running the elections in the individual states.
In this sense, since 2009, the majority of American governments have announced new laws that complicate the procedure for registration or appointment.
This phenomenon has gained in importance after the November 2010 elections, in which 675 new Republican representatives could be registered in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 alone, restricting the exercise of electoral law in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the periods for early voting, invalidate the right to register as a voter on election day, and deny citizens the right to vote for which a court act exists.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. state has asked voters to present a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to make such a claim.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of Indiana’s law.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have promoted draft laws in 34 states that force voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, i.e. 21 million eligible voters, do not have a photo ID issued by a government agency of their state.
In addition, five million new voters do not have such an ID in 2012.
However, often more than a hundred dollars are to be paid to get the required ID.
Young people, minorities and people with low incomes are disproportionately affected by the new restrictions.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 years of age and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the required photo ID.
This goes even further.
Students who are seen as voters who increasingly vote for Democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photo ID issued by their institution in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more strongly for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these clubs for elections.
Before 2004, no state has asked for proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a demand.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic vote.
It is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have promoted laws in eight states in 2011 that abolished voter registration on election day.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, campaigns for voter registration in the 2004 general elections helped to register about 10 million citizens.
As a result of the measures adopted since 2009, the proportion of new voters registered in 2010 has decreased by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers in five other states have passed laws aimed at shortening the period for early voting.
For example, in the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, although they accounted for only 13% of the state’s voters.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter accounted for only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, the whites, who represented 76% of the voters, accounted for only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their supporters have vigorously opposed the passing of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several bills were blocked by the vetoes of democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws that require the display of a photo ID.
However, the newly introduced rules in 2012 will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote.
Democratic critics denounce the party-political nature of the passed laws and see in them as a clear goal the influence of the results in the states decisive for 2012.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Center shows that those states that passed these laws make up 171 of the 270 votes required by the Electoral Men’s Committee to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these amendments to the legislation on the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is for sure: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Prostate cancer early detection: should the test be done or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes showed incorrect results, with false negative or even false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to a stronger hesitation of the already undecided men for carrying out early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We have received the opinion of two specialists.
The studies conducted in the United States included numerous interfering factors between the control groups, making it difficult to interpret this data and make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study has also shown that after 12 years of follow-up, the likelihood of formation of metastases is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection has been performed.
Therefore, I recommend the test from the age of 50 or 40 if you have a direct relative who has already had prostate cancer.
There is also a higher risk for African-American men.
The most important thing is to make the right decision once a cancer has been detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient needs to be made really understandable about the extent of the risk of his cancer by showing him the possible options where prostate cancer can remain untreated if it does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases, he is more likely to opt for active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer do not receive treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
They are suggested to be actively monitored and to be treated as the disease progresses.
With increasing accuracy, the criteria for a decision are determined, who should be treated and who should not be treated.
That is why I recommend conducting the test.
Most important, however, is to talk to his doctor to determine whether he should be performed or not.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has developed an instrument to assess the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no cure for cancer prevention.
Despite advances in research, adopting a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of developing it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone ate well and moved sufficiently.
“If there were no more smokers, this value would rise at least to 50%,” said André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It greatly harms people’s health.
“Today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” said André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after quitting the cigarette, the risk of dying from cancer decreases by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, overweight and obesity also promote the onset of the disease.
They appear to increase the risk of breast, grim, colon, esophagus, pancreas and uterine cancer.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against cancer of the anus," he adds.
The diet
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large a quantity, it increases the risk of developing grim or colon cancer.
Sausages should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
“Later, the body cells can damage and lead to the development of cancer,” he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have investigated the relationship between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their investigations are not conclusive at the moment.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found the reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not yet been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family pre-emptment.
"Performing an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs boson analyzed
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson has sparked a bit of excitement last summer, and for good reason.
It is indeed believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence has been predicted by the standard model - our best or "at least false" explanation of nature and the behavior of matter - but has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists, it is not yet completely certain that it is really the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto, but there is still data missing to be completely sure about it.
However, if we assume that it is actually the Higgs, since there seems to be only a small risk of being fooled, and we look at what it is about.
There is an inevitable law in this world, which means that two objects cannot be present in the same place at the same time.
It’s not possible to violate this rule – and don’t try it too hard as you’ll hurt yourself.
For even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that such a law also applies to them: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state", this "state" being largely composed of some of its properties.
Based on this, the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens, who are called Fermione and politely obey the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the bosons, an evil band of anarchists, to whom nothing is sacred - certainly not this principle, which means that they can indeed be in the same place at the same time.
According to The Particle Adventure website, these bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons that we won’t treat here and the “power particles” by which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
But it must be emphasized here that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures as one might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "light particle", which is the "message" of the electromagnetic force.
When a particle accelerates with an electric charge or changes the direction, the electromagnetic field is "disturbed" at this exact location, approximately like a pebble thrown into a pond.
This "disorder" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and thus one of the bosons "carriers of power".
Stable field
The same applies to the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "disturbed" so that this boson shows up.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the exciter must achieve very high energies, a bit comparable to a frozen pond whose surface could only be marred by a very large rock.
This is why a huge particle accelerator such as the CERN is required - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! - to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others don’t – for example, a sheet of paper would never keep by itself at the refrigerator.
And similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while the others (like the photon by the way) have no mass.
For what can all these research be "good," asks Mrs. Plamondon?
For science, they are used to verify the standard model (SM), and they also allow physicists to carefully investigate any deviations between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
By the way, there are numerous physicists who eagerly hope that such deviations will be found, since the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and plug some holes in the model.
It has to be said that the latter still has great defects, as it does not provide an explanation for the gravity (ups!) and dark matter that makes up about 80% of the matter of the universe (again ups!).
However, such deviations have not been found at CERN so far.
Impacts
The impact of these research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there would be none.
By the way: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell labs did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who himself developed the first continuous-stroke laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962 - has already told us that the laser was at first seen as a "laboratory".
Just imagine...
In addition, applications can also result from all the instruments that surround the research.
For example, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969 during his work in optics.
Although it was not the original purpose, today this sensor serves as an “eye” for all digital cameras worldwide and has earned it the 2009 Nobel Prize for Physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it means that you really can never know...
Palliative care - the best way to die... <0x7C> Le Devoir
With her committee on "Death in Dignity", Quebec recently discussed the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate must be resumed soon, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, there is still much to do in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to look at this in more detail.
A few weeks ago Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that consumed him had left him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I managed seven years," he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed in the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he had arrived the day before.
“However, it’s always a shock, you can’t be prepared for that,” he says.
The disease does its job: an immense weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
Sitting at the table in front of a delicious lunch, he agrees to be resigned to help with the meal.
Courageously, he even manages to smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medication, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
“My biggest wish is to heal my diarrhea, as this is humiliating,” he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
“In the course of our lives, we learn that a man is peeing while standing,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois home.
Returning to the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
“That depends on the person’s ability to take a step back,” he notes.
According to several people who work in palliative care, major events take place in the midst of these setbacks.
The patients who are admitted to the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they are no longer overwhelmed by the doctors and nurses who take care of them with so-called “healing” care.
For Mrs. A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die "consciously and through suffocation".
But because of the illness, I really got to know my children.
“I have good children,” she adds.
"I don't have any wishes in life anymore," she says, before she accepts to put on a mask that helps her breathe.
In the next few days, she still expects her son to come from Italy.
In the Victor-Gadbois home, a group of volunteers offer personal care and assistance in food intake.
Palliative care is used when there are no other options.
To make dying more enjoyable.
In Quebec, there is a bed for palliative care for 11,700 people.
This is very little, considering that one day we will all die.
Here life is continued under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
A mouth care with brandy or pepsi is granted to the dying person as desired.
Diabetics no longer need to control their blood sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died over the course of the night.
This morning his son will drink the beer at the foot of the deceased.
“We are helping relatives and patients alike,” says Nathalie Savard, the care director.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois there is no day like the other.
In addition to an old man of 93 years old, who enjoys the last family gathering in the yard and is well supported by his pillow while he is pushed to his honor, a young man of 36 years old, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two little children, tragically dies after trying everything to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds have always been occupied with cancer patients less than 45 years of age," Dr. Christiane Martel said.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbois home come from their residence, 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e., to care to alleviate the suffering of patients when the latter have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois home and the Montreal-wide Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
Precisely this great inadequacy in Quebec health care ensures that several doctors specialized in palliative care are concerned about the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since the month of October, a manifesto has been in circulation, signed by prominent personalities of palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, to express their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec’s health care system is not powerful enough to ensure that everyone has the right to high-quality palliative care before accepting the move to death care.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was in the emergency room for 14 days with great pain without taking any measures to relieve her.
I fear that the patients only want to die because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients, despite the worst predictions, until the last day.
Hél<0xC3><0xA8>ne Richard’s chances of survival were already minimal when she discontinued a cumbersome chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to stop the treatment, she replied to me that she regretted giving up the fight, she told me.
She told me that I was in the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die thank the caregivers for failing to do so after their pain has been alleviated by a team of palliative care.
However, it must be clearly stated that palliative care in pain treatment is not omnipotent.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of palliative care at the Montreal Society of Domestic Palliative Care, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to terminal sedation, which results in the patient sleeping either sporadically or permanently until the time of his death.
We can no longer pretend that we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to resort to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not relieved say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But that doesn’t necessarily mean, “I want you to sleep with me,” but “I want my pain to be relieved.”
The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship from Canadian health research institutes.
Real estate scandals of large scale in Quebec
Officials from the road construction office, construction industry companies, political party money-makers and specialists from the Italian mafia tell us every day what they know about a great "system" in which construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso are entangled.
An "industry" that was very expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's strange how the system has crumbled since drastic measures have been taken," said Jacques Duchesneau, Quebec MP and former Montreal Police Chief.
The scandal was revealed by him due to an in-depth investigation of the mishaps related to the contracts for road construction in Quebec, which the then prime minister had only reluctantly agreed to.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010,” he emphasizes, “the Department of Transportation alone had saved a billion dollars in the contracts,” as some have been pulling their instincts to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission “has already brought down two mayors,” he adds, hoping that it will succeed in “showcasing the tactics behind the individuals.”
A permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit, which was launched in 2011, is also making great efforts with its troops on the government’s auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the police of the "Marteau Group", which since 2009 has caused Montreal's "channeling cartel" to proceed more cautiously in artificially inflating the contracts...
In recent weeks, she has carried out a series of house searches and has charged with fraud and corruption against municipal mandate holders such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is the mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his office as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of having repeatedly received lubricating money in exchange for public contracts.
By the way, engineers from the Montreal road construction office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambiato, were explicitly charged.
The latter has aroused concern by explaining to the Commission the functioning of the "system" for the receipt of public contracts.
For several years, he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to an intermediary associated with the Mafia who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Mr. Zambia had his hand in the game everywhere by giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals who were in power at the time.
He also confessed to having organized an illegal fundraising campaign for former Liberal Vice President Nathalie Normandeau.
sewerage contracts, the cost of which was artificially inflated by him
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked smoothly.
Former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years he received from the construction company gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes amounting to $736,000 in return for sewerage contracts, the cost of which he artificially inflated.
Other road construction officials have admitted that they could be lubricated by artificially inflating the invoices with false additional services by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor’s party, Martin Dumont, has accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately ignoring a shadow budget that filled his cash with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, which plunged Montreal into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first Montreal deputies to strike an alarm.
As mayor of the Rivi<0xC3><0xA8>re-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, from 2010, she opposed the sale of a community property that was purchased for $5 million and sold for 1.6 million to builders in the booming real estate market.
70% black money in the election campaigns
From the investigation, which is ultimately carried out, she says that she draws "on a thread that allows to understand the functioning of the system underwent by ants to stop the evil and denounce the guilty."
She says the procedure is "painful, but positive".
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but we need an investigation unit intended only for Montreal, as well as supervision to prevent a return of questionable practices.
How to clean.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes, in turn, that “officials have stolen several hundred million dollars,” but is especially concerned about the role of “mandate bearers who are in the picture about tactics” if they were not involved in the fraud!
On the basis of a 70% share of black money in funding the election campaigns in Quebec, he jokes: “I was told that this was only a slight slump of reality.”
The Quebec government proposes to limit the donations to parties to $100, which, according to him, would not change anything about the situation: "As long as campaign spending is not strictly limited, black money in politics will be circulating."
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for awarding public contracts and funding the parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by going down things with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story harms the international reputation of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau calls on those who laugh to take a look at their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you have taken a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress on their side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements inspire me every day to improve my level of play.
And with a game, it’s even easier.
In football everything goes very fast.
But I'm not breaking out in enthusiasm.
Since my beginnings in the centre of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine up to my playing time at Saint-Etienne, I have always made gradual progress.
They thus take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new additions this summer are used to performing games at very high levels.
You also know that every training session is crucial.
This means that a player like me has to offer the forehead and want to do his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my playing position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
There is currently no comparable person in Ligue 1 and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with respected clubs.
He was in contact with big players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
At the time, I had just recovered from an injury series.
The trust he has placed in me is also an explanation for my accomplishments.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took the place of the top rider.
But we are lurking in ambush.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we qualified in this way for the eighth final.
What is the aim of the association in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
Everything is possible from now on.
However, we will have to speak against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to be the first of our group in front of Porto, so that we can play the return match of the eighth final as a home game.
Can the PSG become a major European association in the short term?
He already has the budget for it...
In order to become a major European club, Paris must win the title and make a name for itself in the long term.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG is giving itself the means for this project to take concrete forms.
Would it be a big failure not to win the title in Ligue 1, as was the case in the last season?
Of course, this would be a big disappointment.
This year we really want to celebrate this title.
Last season we were close.
In May, we were disappointed because we were strong enough to win.
We finished the season with a very strong performance.
We finished with 79 points.
Usually you should be a master with 79 points...
But another team, the Montpellier team, has achieved an even better season.
I think this year is the right one.
Even though the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the stuff to win him.
Do you think the media expect too much from PSG?
Given what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that much of us are expected.
We accept this perfectly.
However, if we win a home game against Troyes 4-0, and you still find something you can accuse us of, that is certainly a bit frustrating.
You wonder what people are still waiting for.
We could never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We are trying to create a game concept.
A team builds over time.
In the Champions League we have proven strength.
Look at Manchester City, a club that has not been able to qualify for the eighth final for two seasons, and who has also made huge expenses!
With regard to the invested sums, you were believed to be at the game break with 15 points ahead of you!
This meant that our opponents and the French championship would be disregarded.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not good last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in the month of May we will be the smiling winner and tell ourselves that we have finally won them, despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
All the better to talk about a "Zlatan addiction."
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many goals.
That's why he came and he proves he's the star of Ligue 1.
Everywhere he played, he showed that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the 2012 European Championship with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
It was very important to me to participate in this event.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from playing out some playing time.
I have seen things that have strengthened me.
Today I manage to make good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since I was baptized with the "Bleus".
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we must demonstrate an exemplary behaviour.
What do you think of Didier Deschamps' first months at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualification group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strict, is close to the players and encourages them to win.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the European Championship.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Is the tie forced in Spain on October 16th (1:1) an opening game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone is committed to everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a similar game in my career.
With Bitcoin, paying and selling without a bank is possible
The opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties involved.
Moreover, as so often in these technologies, a political vision can be grasped: the conviction that the current monetary system, designed by bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros, etc.) and a protocol for secure exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers on the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
A few thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After the price of Bitcoin reached a peak of $30 ($23) in June 2011, it dropped to $2 five months later before recovering to around $10 today (the prices are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to the world trade of real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "competition with the dollar or euro" and "similar to traditional currencies".
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies such as the “credits” that are used to progress in a video game that you can win or buy through games (and sometimes also trade back).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, trade is controlled and processed every time by a central authority.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously depositors of the invoice book, auditors, money issuers as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of the data related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.
Using the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the traded bitcoins are present in the public account book spread throughout the network.
The crucial step is to enter this new transaction into this book.
This is done via a mathematical task that is started on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, having the privilege to add this additional line.
It is a fragmentation of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole thing is "cracked."
The goal is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes can easily check if it is the right one.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If one user wants to pay twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other would remain unlinked, since both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the task gets 50 bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
Bitcoins in circulation are therefore limited to 21 million, but can be divided up to a hundred millionths, leaving a certain amount of room for manoeuvre.
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with each improvement in computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
The websites providing services to Bitcoin were attacked and the Bitcoin deposits were stolen.
“The vulnerability used does not concern the actual protocol,” says Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a real money payment company and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.
However, cash also has these shortcomings.
Important actors such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
They are accepted by others such as the WordPress blog platform.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the billbook and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "mega closing sale" was launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” said Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions, which are cheaper as a result.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented by traders, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just need to provide an address that can be “photographed and recognized” by a phone, says Pierre Noizat, who assures that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend in which hierarchical systems are considered in favor of more horizontal systems.
“It will take some time for Bitcoin to get through, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicts.
By the way, the ECB's report provides for a reassessment of the various risks currently considered to be highly regarded in the event of a success of this currency.
We have moved out of Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left their responsibilities in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US are expected to follow in late 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take possession of its territory again, and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting anything from us.
In particular, we punished Afghan farmers by considering them terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 killed soldiers, as well as the injured and injured.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also farmers who refuse an armed foreign presence, such as the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if they have joined jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks.
Tolerate, sometimes supported by local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there as the Western countries become more discrete.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees, which was financed by French loans, was proper.
The lorries and tank convoys flown by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
As of the end of 2014, there will be no more inflows of the Taliban into Kabul.
Since its irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed.
At that time Kabul was empty and the country was overrun by war because of the struggles of the various rebel groups.
Their takeover of power was considered a kind of liberation and return to security at the time.
Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of farmers overwhelmed by the Al Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved to this day.
Former Mujahedin, the Afghan government and the current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The most important figures of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have turned into business makers by confiscating government land to sell it as a construction land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from the massive American subcontracting.
They have been discredited, and most of them were not themselves involved in the fighting.
As I have heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, just like those who could make use of the American grants: capital flight is considerable.
Young people are fed up with war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world and enjoyed its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, state schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders, will have to provide jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is watched everywhere.
There is now an army.
Are the authorities under whose authority they will be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already working to restore the militias in the province that will evade the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the land of mountains with strong local identities should have benefited from some decentralization on the example of Western nations, but by abolishing the office of Prime Minister, which existed since the 1964 constitution, the United States wanted to make him a centralized state with a strong presidential power.
President Karza<0xC3><0xAF> does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional dams are not available and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; apart from fruits and vegetables, nothing is produced.
The private initiative is given priority.
In a country that has been subjected to war for 30 years, state control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumor has spread that Afghanistan possessed immense natural resources.
This further reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only on the ground to take control of it.
Without energy to process the iron or copper ore on site, or without means of transport for an export via the mountains, mining is not possible.
The Chinese have already almost abandoned the Mes Aynak copper mine, let the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) do their excavations on the huge Buddhist site and remain the main employers of the province.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, largely dependent on imports and exports, to reestablish normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' and boys' secondary schools, French Institute at universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service "civil military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), which was discontinued in 2012, has carried out numerous non-profit works and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages and has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organization to try to "win the hearts and spirits" and achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions.
These works, which required numerous local workers, have helped to suppress the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and raising agricultural land.
Which souvenir do we leave behind after military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very hard in these often over 2000-metre-high valleys.
The embassy received dozens of written requests from municipalities in Kapisa Province for small agricultural projects.
In order for farmers to free themselves from the insurrection led by foreign groups, which according to their own statements is their wish, the continuation of small, well-controlled and directly related civilian aid would be necessary in their favour.
A constitution with the crowbar in Egypt
This is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt remains divided more than ever in terms of the Constitutional Declaration, which temporarily grants it unlimited power of attorney, it has decided to put everything on a map.
To everyone’s surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the constitutional assembly would adopt its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had granted this plenary two additional months for the completion of his work.
Egypt has now been relying for almost two years on a provisional text that has been amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal confusion.
This new initiative has only created an even stronger division of the country.
For his opponents, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "break his word" and "put right with his feet".
On the part of its proponents, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time that forces the brothers to forgo their plan to explain to the Egyptians the text section by section.
For the president, it is also a way to regain his public and democratic legitimacy while the protest rages across the country.
After confirmation in an interview with the American weekly Time, Mohammed Mursi appears to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote favorably.
Especially since the Egyptian people, with this recourse to a hasty vote, are placed an ultimatum: "Either you vote for my draft or I retain the unlimited power of attorney", the latter should supposedly end after the adoption of the constitution.
85 mostly Islamist members of this constitutional assembly adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of liberals have not complied with the request.
Shortly before the constitutional declaration in mid-November, they turned away, believing that they have not been able to bring their views to light.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally.
To achieve the quorum, 11 people, deputy members, were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that the articles were mostly unanimously adopted.
By the way, the commentators found it amusing that the only difference of opinion of the day... was expressed in the time of prayer, as some members of the panel felt that the pendulum clock of the constituent assembly was not going exactly.
The text, which was adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Finally, Article 2, which drew all attention to itself, remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stating that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had the hope of replacing "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made stricter application possible.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is proof of their goodwill and respect for the other members of Egyptian society.
"Beautifulness" answers the liberals, who see this only as a propaganda blow.
According to them, the Islamicization of the Constitution takes place over other articles.
In particular, they have in mind Article 220, which recognises an advisory function of the University of Al-Azhar, in particular with regard to the verification of conformity with the laws of Sharia.
According to Egypt’s specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because “the people who are asked for an opinion have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the first signs of theocracy here.”
The concerns of the liberals are also fuelled by the fact that the next rector of this university is likely to be far less moderate than the current one.
“There is currently no concrete religious commitment.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not ulema, but academics who have been partially trained in the French system," says Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
He concedes, however, that "there may be ambiguity with regard to Article 220, since the terms used are borrowed from religious vocabulary.
In particular, reference is made here to the "Fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, note d. Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised as to the extent to which civil judges are competent to decide on it."
In addition to his religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is heavily criticized for the far-reaching powers he grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers argue that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defence budget is not presented to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Similarly, there will be no ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as the associations have called for in defence of human rights.
The latter also share their fears about the text they consider to be freedom-threatening.
The facts of blasphemy are being maintained, and insults are now forbidden, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no more articles relate to the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In your opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak out on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
Proponents of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists expect sacred sites, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the glory of Bible truths, modern comfort and an untouched nature.
AIF gives you the top five reasons to visit Israel.
bowing in front of the holy places
Visit the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all those who bathe in this river receive God’s blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the conversion of water into wine at a wedding feast, walking on the water, the sedation of the sea storm and fishing.
This is where Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
Most of the shrines are found in Jerusalem.
Here, believers take the path of suffering or the cross of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The path begins at the Roman fortress Antonia, Pretorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the tomb church on Mount Golgotha, where the crucifixion site, the anointing stone and the tomb of Jesus are located.
Here, in the Christian view, is the navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
The Monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands at the place where, according to Christian legend, the tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus grew.
In Jerusalem is also the holiest place of the Jews - the lamentation wall, the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D.
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave papers there with wishes that then come true.
Take a trip to the top
The ruins of the fortress of Massada form the remains of the secret hideout from enemies that Herod the Great had built for his family in 25 A.D.
They are located on a rock wall in the mountains at 450 meters above sea level.
Only mountaineers can reach the ruins on their own.
Everyone else brings an aerial cable car to this historic summit.
In the north of the country at 1600 to 2040 meters altitude is the famous ski resort Hermon, in which it attracts countless tourists during the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can get there by shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods supposedly lived on the mountaintop.
Visiting Unique Museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
In just one trip, not all of them can be visited.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be made a visit.
Among them is the Israel Museum near the Knesset (Parliament).
There, ancient Qumran manuscripts or scrolls of the Dead Sea found in rock caves in the Judean desert are kept, as well as about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
There, the collection of works by Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso will be exhibited.
In Akko you can visit the museum in Bad Al Basha, which houses several halls of old Turkish baths with sculptures of the then visitors and bathers.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free, and donations are generally rejected.
The fifth museum, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most shocking chapters in history.
The most gripping section is the memorial to the children, which was built to commemorate the 1.5 million children who were destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When entering the room, there is total darkness.
The stars sparkle.
And the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died are heard.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Do something for health
The three main recreation areas of Israel are located on the banks of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Amazingly, the Red Sea is also bathed in the winter months, as the water temperature does not fall below 21°C and the air warms up to 23°C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and is bathed there all year round.
Incidentally, this unusual sea with a position of 417 meters below sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise-blue water has a high salt content and thus even carries non-swimmers on the surface without any problems.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt brine) and medicinal sludge, as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to calm stressed nerves.
Touching the Secrets of Antiquity
These secrets hold the old town of Tel Aviv, namely the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
The famous sea route linking Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia passed through this city.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, Noah built his ark right here, and Perseus saved here the beautiful Andromeda with which he lived a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to stroll through the narrow streets named after zodiac signs.
Fortuna is said to be the legend of all those who touch the walls of the alley with their zodiac sign.
In Jaffa you can meet newlywed couples from all over Israel and even other countries at photo appointments.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can roam the Roman theatre and conquer the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and residence of Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
In the carefully restored theatre, evening concerts and operas are performed today.
List of Tourists
If you’re going to Israel, don’t worry about your poor English skills: about 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
You prefer not to take the money in euros, but in dollars that can be easily changed into shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city you usually get on the bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a highway and in Haifa the only metro line of the country with six stations that connects the lower city to the upper city.
In fact, it is an underground funicular.
A journey within the city costs 6 shekels regardless of the mode of transport, which includes transfers for a journey of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated in Israel on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transport is at rest.
And on Sunday morning the work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and restaurants only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without dandruff and foods that contain both dairy and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between different dishes with ham and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, various sauces, fried balls of pureed beans and peas (falafel) as well as fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
For this, there are many well-fed cats that roam the streets comfortably and indecently.
In the evening you can even see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
The cats like busy places and don’t say no to treats.
Depending on the brand, a rental car costs between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) and $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
The insurance costs an additional $15 per day.
Bicycle rental costs 15 shekels per day.
Tickets for museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
In numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of the adventurers and recreational seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the United States and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists came to the Promised Land, which corresponds to an increase of 51% compared to the comparison period in 2010, before the cancellation of the visa requirement on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" Leads to Moscow: Migrants Save Money for Language
While MPs and civil rights activists discuss the benefits of the law on binding language tests for migrants, criminals are already trading fake certificates
Every year, 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money for the maintenance of the families remaining in the home.
On December 1, a law came into force, according to which every migrant worker must take a test that certifies knowledge of the Russian language.
Until now, this rule applies only to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the municipal housing industry and in retail.
However, over time, according to the Federal Migration Authority, the tests will become mandatory for all guest workers in the future.
In doing so, one must not only take language tests, but also tests into Russian history and the basics of legislation.
Language skills must be proven for both obtaining and extending the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries in which Russian is the official language.
Also excluded from this law are persons who received their certificates and diplomas before the fall of the USSR in 1991.
Sense, problem and protection of rights
The entire examination body will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute for Russian Language, the Russian University of People's Friendship, the Moscow State University, the Saint Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can take the tests in all cities; already more than 160 corresponding centres have been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
Civil rights activists, on the other hand, asked the following question several times before the law came into force in the press: What does the whole thing actually bring?
What changes does the requirement to have language skills, both for the Russians and for the guest workers?
In particular, counter-speakers from the Migration Authority are concerned with reducing the number of forced labourers.
“Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers,” says Viktor Sebelev, head of the Federal Migration Agency’s representation in Tajikistan.
However, your rights must be protected before you leave.
Only an organized recruitment will 90% solve the problems of foreign workers.
Migrants encounter problems without a job, education, language skills and medical evaluation.
Sebelev is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions, who, under the pretext of help, put him in a dark, narrow barracks, where he will endure with dozens of his own months without food and documents and spend 12 to 14 hours a day.
There are many complaints from our migrants.
“At home, the One will be promised to you, and upon arrival you will be cheated, their passports will be taken away, and you will not receive the promised pay,” confirmed the head of the head of the labor migration department of the Tajik Migration Agency, Tolib Schwaripov.
Don't insult me, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who want to make their money in Russia, admit that not only do they not master the language of the target country, but they can hardly express themselves in their own language in writing.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, but rather the evil: only a few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford even a reasonable primary education.
Because in their families there is not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy them decent clothes, shoes and school supplies.
As a teenager, these children immediately seize the first opportunity to earn money.
"It's difficult without language skills," they admit.
“You feel humiliated and inferior.”
Civil rights activists stress the following important aspects of the law.
Only migrants with legal status are required to take the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of guest workers continue to stay illegally in Russia.
"Really welcome" or "access for unauthorized persons prohibited"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to get an official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, linguistic difficulties.
In addition, the legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be made quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that our documents are mostly faked and we are not registered, and that is when cases of extortion arise.
“They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea,” Tajik Umed Hushkadamov told reporters.
"Just don't shy away from the cost of wrong papers"
Already on the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of the migrants can be faked.
Some fake certificates certifying the completion of the language test have already been seized by employees of the Federal Migration Authority.
The fake papers were printed with an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get them for nothing: every migrant who hoped to save himself the tests paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
That’s more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: this one costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The fact that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption, so that the certificates cannot be easily purchased, both officials and civil rights activists agree.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise guest workers who fall through the test for the first time that they will be given time for a basic language course.
In addition, newcomers without language skills are offered positions in areas where no active communication with people is necessary.
Interior Ministry ignores illegal arms market
Proportion of legal weapons in crimes extremely low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior is planning to tighten the gun law for private gun owners.
The authorities are thus responding to the latest events: injured in shootings at weddings and seven dead in the shooting of Moscow lawyer Dmitri Winogradov.
The police want to ban the wearing of non-lethal weapons in public and raise the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal was supported by the chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Jarovaja, and promised that the amendments to the Weapons Act will be submitted to the Duma shortly.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian authorities want to combat the problems by "attracting the screws".
An open letter was published on the Internet, whose authors - representatives of various arms associations - call on the authorities to distance themselves from "sensuous intensifications".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, said the criminal justice, Wasily Lesnikov, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes were committed with the use of registered weapons over the course of six months in 2012, while a total of 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that tightening the law for private gun owners will not stop criminals from serving on the black market.
According to the authors in Moscow, one can find any weapon for little money.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior stresses that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The weapons enter the black market via several channels.
There are five such main channels, says a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who spent ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that accepts weapons orders
The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," Baranez said.
The second channel contains illegal weapons, which are stolen by criminals.
Baranez explains that this includes weapons that have been stolen from both the police’s arms chambers and directly from law enforcement personnel.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military weapons camps.
In many military camps, explosions often occurred.
"There is evidence that some cases were arson to cover up the lack of weapons," the former military official said.
According to Baranez, the arms manufacturers are also making a contribution to the black market.
“Today, there are countless private armaments factories that do not stand up to international competition and therefore squander the weapons under hand on the black market, for example in Moscow,” the expert reports.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
Especially many guns and guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
“There is a separate, sometimes artisan production there, as well as a mafia that organizes the smuggling,” the former military member explains.
Where did the weapons come from?
Experts calculated the share of each of the five channels in supplying the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was written by the Center for Problem Analysis and State Administration.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, criminological literature and publicly available data on portals on weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to the investigators, come from the army and the law enforcement agencies.
Half of all the weapons on the black market are there because of the "debt of those responsible for their work with weapons," the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from conflict zones, 14% are based on thefts in the production of weapons, and 5% are from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant at a gun store who doesn’t want to be named, assures that weapons found in illegal excavations have long since been bought by no one, as they are outdated.
According to him, it is more common for traders to get the supplies in a weapons warehouse.
A gun, for example a TT-type pistol, is bought via a faucet.
The weapon is issued and handed over through the fence.
"The dealer brings the gun to the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says.
“The police, of course, know all about it and therefore, if they can’t comply with the crime detection plan, periodically conduct control purchases at dealers offering illegal weapons,” the sales consultant added.
"As in the luxury shop"
Buyers and sellers most often find out about acquaintances with each other.
I had looked at websites and blogs when someone became aware of me and suggested me to come to the station "Begowaja", where a person would wait for me, who would take me to a certain place, where we could then negotiate the price.
The price of the gun was only there.
Commentary by Viktor Baranez
“To get a gun, I need a friend who has contacts,” says the sales consultant. “I have such a friend, but I don’t trust him.”
There are traders in the markets, but there you have to go and meet up with a code like "by Ivan Ivanovich, who lets you know that the daughter has lost a tooth".
I’m currently even getting to some hit rings about a friend I trust.
He also gives me the batting rings just because he knows I don't pee him.
Newbies are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military member Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on the subject.
According to him, the schemes have not changed.
He got a photo album in which "everything possible" was depicted.
“I felt like I was in a luxury store,” recalls the military member.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything.
As a potential customer, I don’t just buy, but drive with the seller into the forest, and there we set up a target.
"I can then shoot there, and if I'm convinced that the gun has a good shot, we're negotiating with each other," the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for various purposes".
No papers are needed or there are personal meetings.
"You only need the appropriate amount of money," the ad says on the website "Buy a fighter gun or rifle".
There, users place their orders and make requests.
Is it also sold to minors?
"Of course without a license", asks user "Iwan" (literally quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow", is the laconic request of "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service recently switched countless fake websites, and buyers who want to purchase weapons go up to the service.
People come like hungry fish at feeding and then land in Siberia and are allowed to shovel coal
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The responsible parties accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money via a ATM.
"In response, he receives a photo and a description of the hiding of the weapon," reports the press spokesman of the non-profit organization Pravo na oryzhie Dmitry Kislow.
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that in the end you can also go out empty and get behind bars when you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently switched countless fake websites, and buyers who want to purchase weapons go up to the service.
“People come like hungry fish at feeding and then end up in the Siberian labor camp and are allowed to shovel coal,” he says.
A Makarow for $100
According to experts, when buying illegal firearms, prices range from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitry Kislow of the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" you can buy a Makarow gun for $100 to $300.
You have to wait up to one and a half months.
The weapon is issued in military weapons camps by mid-range supervisors.
According to official statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, the number of offences involving illegal weapons across Russia fell by 7% to 22.9 thousand between January and October 2011, while the number of cases of theft and extortion related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives decreased by 7.8%.
Fast food and supermarket workers strike in the U.S.
One in four U.S. youths sit behind Mc Donald's box office at some point
In recent days there have been massive protests across the U.S. against low wages in Walmart stores and restaurants of popular fast-food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can predict whether the protests will continue to swell or if they will soon be out of the air again.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organizations.
In addition to raising the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast-food workers, the organizers of the protests pursue the goal of founding trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy has hardly been unionized.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, where sales took place in the U.S., attracting millions of customers, sometimes resulting in handcuffs.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, dropped their jobs and, together with trade unions and left-wing activists, branched out of the chain, whose target group is people of low and middle income.
Walmart sells all products, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart stores are between 8 and 27% cheaper on average than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many of the slightly paid Walmart employees only buy at their own workplace.
The prices and product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can often only sell the goods so cheaply because the employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about heavy working conditions, such as missing forklifts or hand scanners.
The participants of the protests on Black Friday called for wage increases and expressed their anger that the contribution to company-owned health insurance had risen from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart employee who earns $9.5 an hour couldn’t afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from California University in Berkeley prove that if the company raised the average wage to $12 an hour, it would cost Walmart $3.2 billion.
That's about 1.1% more than they're now donating for pay.
If Walmart were to completely convert the wage increases to customers, each purchase would cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
Every year, that would be for them compared to today’s multi-issues of just $12.39.
Walmart supporters are pleased to note that there were only protests in nine states and they did not cause any losses to the company.
Black Friday lasted from 8 a.m. on Thursday to midnight the next day, and during that period Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, Walmart’s cash registers performed nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The company’s spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the left-wing Huffington Post’s website that a total of “less than five” Walmart employees laid down the work and the protest action was merely “another PR trick” of the union that organized the protests.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal was not Walmart stores (which are not desirable in this advanced city and therefore so far inexistent), but McDonald's and other affordable restaurants.
McDonald’s says the company sells billions of servings, and yet they don’t give you sick days, and you won’t be paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage according to federal and New York legislation is $7.25 an hour.
In fast-food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually raised, but not too strong, and on average their simple employees in New York get $8.90 an hour.
Less than she deserves no one in this expensive city.
How it is possible to make money with so little money in New York is incomprehensible to me.
There was once a time when almost a quarter of all U.S. youth after school were behind the counter at McDonald’s, but the youth were still living with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now, in interviews with McDonald’s employees, I constantly meet people who complain that they can afford this paycheck and sometimes even have to feed their children.
On the other hand, there’s a comment in the Wall Street Journal’s forum, whose author notes that it’s irresponsible to have children if you don’t know how to feed them.
The participants of the protests, which began on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. in front of McDonald’s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and chefs of fast food restaurants receive a minimum wage of $15 an hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They continued to demand the formation of trade unions in the fast food industry.
The U.S. law forbids corporate governance to stand in the way of this goal and to denounce or dismiss union members.
On the other hand, management doesn’t make it easy for them.
However, the establishment of trade unions in the fast food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high personnel fluctuation.
Unsatisfied
There were loud protests that day in front of many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the protests was a midday rally in front of McDonald's in Times Square, where some local Democrats spoke, including City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and yet you're not given sick days, and you're not paid for your honest work!"
The protesters were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should work together to support the fast-food workers so that they can get a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!".
According to the New York Times, this was the biggest action of its kind in the history of the U.S. fast food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on site, far from all of whom are employed in the fast food industry, where tens of thousands work in New York.
It is yet to be seen whether the spark of these protests will mobilize entire masses.
"The brain can only be moderately overtaken"
The topic of expanded reality, popular among modern technology fans, has recently been commonly perceived by the lens of a special eyewear.
Google first presented a working model at its annual conference this summer, and in November it was announced that Microsoft had also filed a patent.
In conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3D technologies at the Microsoft lab in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, however, it becomes clear that the glasses for the company’s scientists were only a transit station.
It stimulates the ability to manipulate virtual objects in the air with bare hands and create virtual free spaces.
- Please describe briefly what research your group is doing.
- We deal with the interaction of man and machine, but want to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, humanity has largely remained stuck in the phase of working with pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes also touched.
However, we want to look ahead 5-10 years and anticipate the radical changes of this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are progressing, and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect as everyone is interested in motion control.
- What do we expect in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, much still takes place on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the output has not yet been decisive.
We try to change that, working on real three-dimensional representation systems based on different technologies, including projections.
We must release the computer world into our physical world and make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary that not only the user, but also his environment is recognized.
Then we could add virtual objects to the real world much more easily.
And first of all, we should get rid of these messy virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
It’s popular, but isn’t it overrated?
- It is certainly not the general purpose solution, as it raises questions about privacy, because you do not always want to inform all those around you about their actions and intentions.
Actually, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but each in its particular niche.
For example, in the field of controlling objects in public places, we worked on a project where we experimented with short and short, rather than exuberant gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But overall, the future belongs to mixed control types, such as gestures and language.
- How's that?
- For example, we'd ask you to give me this spray can?
They say it and point it out at the same time.
- I usually just say it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to see.
- Does that mean you want the user to adapt to what a machine can do at the time and what not?
- Not necessarily, but this is about a mutual approach.
I think that in the near future we will have to work primarily on developing new sensor types that will allow us to more accurately capture reactions from people.
These can be laser sensors, for example, as they offer a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- What are your demands from working with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth or anything else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the area of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
All current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of the algorithms have more work.
It is not only necessary to consider the resolution along the X and Y axis, but also along the Z axis.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
The movements of man are extremely dynamic and frankly, the current 30 fps, especially for gestures, are too little.
In our Redmond laboratory, Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay of between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with today’s commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of humans and machines.
For my work, I needed a device like this, only without touch control and with more images per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect currently works with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the object depth.
More cameras may be able to solve the problem...
Or increase the problem, as more calculations would be needed.
It would be nice to have a flexible Kinect-like system where we could play with different camera inclinations to see how this helps us determine a position in three dimensions.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that with regard to the application of the technology of extended reality in everyday life, the glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it is not pleasant to always hold a smartphone in the raised hand on the go, but I think the best option would be a "changing" extended reality where we could switch from the glasses to the smartphone via a cloud,
The glasses are a personal gadget and they contain their strength (privates can only see you), but at the same time their weakness, because an expanded reality using glasses prevents you from working together with others on virtual objects.
- Let’s imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is accessible not only to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to normal mortals.
There is a problem that critics of this idea often point to: there is no tangible reaction!
The hands feel nothing at all!
What answers does your group want to give to this objection?
- In my lectures, I often talk about the fact that the expanded reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently using the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection pad.
She takes great care of pressure!
However, there are also technologies that are actually designed to give the "images in the air" something tangible, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasound beams at a certain point where the finger is located creates a feeling that is currently still as weak as if someone was breathing over the palms.
There are also ligaments for the wrist that affect the nerve endings in the fingers, also this is a potential direction.
- Did you try to outsmart the brain?
Thinking that it feels what it should feel when it sees something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried it yet.
Here is another task that we will have to struggle with for a long time, namely to make a person who is physically in a closed space believe that he is instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we work on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), mobile platforms as well as large balls.
So far, the brain can only be moderately overtaken, and there are still many years of work ahead of us.
This is precisely what makes the work in the field of virtual reality so appealing to a researcher: on many topics, we are only at the beginning.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburger Avantgarde", dedicated to urban dwellers who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
High-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose successes go beyond the city’s borders and often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia, were already on the select list.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the red-clad bearded bear that you can find at the Russian Museum, at the summer garden, at scene meetings or at vernissages.
Wherever the pictures of Kirill Miller are on display, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the Petersburg avant-garde in the late 80s and early 90s respectively.
He is also a man of the city and, by his presence on the street, enchants his fellow citizens with a smile on their face and ensures a good mood with them.
Recently, he grabbed a revolving organ and became a Petersburg revolving organ player, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artistry, philosophy and image.
Kirill, why are you always in red and not in yellow or turquoise in the city?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer who deals with the look and image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artist, image consultant and society.
In society, anything that deviates from the grey standard evokes aggression and bad behavior.
I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Each of my previous provocations was an invitation to talk.
When did you know you had to become a painter?
- At an exhibition in the Cultural Palace of Newsky, where my works were exhibited.
I knew I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old free but not officially recognized painters came to an end, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the painters of the new generation, i.e. with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; from this came "Puschkinskaya 10", and then it was only once ended.
I am attracted to theatre, fashion, music, actually to everything, except literature.
And all of this came together in your art clinic... it was important to me to be at the center of Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995 I occupied a room in Pushkinskaya 10, and there until the renovation work there was a musical-artistic club for the Bohemia, the house of the Petersburg Bohemia.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how Schnur got there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Schnur and his friends sang simple songs to the play-back, wore tight jerseys, and among them was the now-popular composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group started to play live, it became their "lening wheel".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began his great career, but he learned the basics with us.
The gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" also have its origin in the art clinic.
Our employees and regular guests went there.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In 2000 there was a survey in the press, which was about the award "Personalities of our city".
I won in the category "Artists of the Year", and with that I had reached the climax.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it’s easy to get famous, but culture and popularity aren’t the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your works have an unmistakable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the topicality and sharpness of thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and is afraid to be that way.
In a clown, all of this gets messed up and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, let’s save the world by prescribing that everyone has to dress up completely.
Now everyone pays attention to the clothes and is oriented on the outside and not on the inside of man.
But maybe you can't give a man his hand, but you should spit him in the face.
The deception disappears by dressing up.
- We recently saw you in the role of the city organ player. - A city of culture should have such a hero.
Who, if not me?
- Can commercial art also be beautiful?
- Nowadays, commercial art must be careful, considerate and flattering.
We see the disintegration of cultures.
In the past, people formed large groups: the Bohemians loved one and the simple people loved the other.
Now there are micro-communities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollar note that everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you will like.
Now each cult star has about 100 followers.
- The performances of Stas Michailow, however, come several thousand!
- To him come abandoned women, there the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people come and not 10 thousand, hence there is less management, money, and everything perishes.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to deceive them and not to destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth I painted such pictures, which were even in a series with the works of Falk and Larionow.
I started with pictures that usually come only at the end of my career.
Nowadays, there are often misunderstandings.
It means: spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, which is quite different.
I am a person of past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to be able to paint.
This is the culture I support.
Kirill, what's missing from Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
They say: Servants of culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
With the real tsars it was different, because the tsars might not understand much of culture, but they understood that proper experts are necessary.
There are currently good advisors in Moscow.
In Petersburg, we have those who could be the experts, but they are blocked because they need more high-ranking experts who correctly evaluate the former and clear the way for them.
Now only your own taste counts.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters therefore have to look for other museums.
- What's the matter with you, Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not the capital of culture; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding breeding ground.
On our stones, art can hardly grow.
We need a cultural breeding ground, because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
With us, these are much less.
Art must be modern again, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded by grants from the city of Saint Petersburg
Birth in Space
Earth in danger.
Warming or clashing with killerasteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with Earth dwellers on board are looking for a replacement planet.
To save humanity, the important question is how can we reproduce in weightlessness or on the replacement planet?
In my opinion, there are not many choices.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
"Especially Mars and Venus," says the scientist at the Astronomical Observatory Institute Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, there is a temperature of 500 degrees on the surface of Venus.
Life would only be possible at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus, i.e. in space.
The question of propagation in space was first addressed by the researchers with regard to the flora.
Already half a century before, experiments with plants were carried out.
The fourth generation of the orbit-breededed peas did not differ in the least from the terrestrial species.
It followed the breeding of insects, more precisely of tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, guards were sent into space to explore how weightlessness affects the development of embryos.
It develops a perfectly normal chick.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chick needs to find a hold; it needs to be able to stand on its legs and start moving," explains the head of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Vladimir Sychew.
Without solid ground, the chicks wildly overwhelm themselves.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns completely mutilated.
The chicks did not respond to light and noise.
Four days later, they simply died.
"Two times we let chicks slip and then put the whole thing in place, because it's simply impossible to work with them there," said Vladimir Sychew, who was involved in the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last cage with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, only same-sex species will be found on the biosatellite "Bion".
There was an experiment with rats that were already fertilized into space.
In principle, nothing special was found.
“This was just with the biosatellites, but once again it was just a single experiment, and the research needs to be continued,” notes Vladimir Sychew.
After the landing, the space rats got offspring.
So far, the problem of reproduction directly in space has not been solved.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are torn from their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive instincts.
Unlike animals, humans can do this in principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
From ethical considerations, such experiments are not carried out.
Women have been flying into space for 50 years.
There was the greatest risk in Tereshkova.
The most valuable thing that humanity possesses is the female organism.
Our seagulls flew away, and no one on earth could have answered the question: does it survive space flight?
Will she be able to give birth to a child after this flight?
"In the end, no one answered this question," says space veteran Wachttang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just a year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereschkowa, gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in space, Swetlana Sawizkaja, who was twice in orbit and even did work outside the spacecraft, gave birth to a son.
Nevertheless, there is a risk.
We have very few cosmonauts, where after long flights everything went well and they got healthy offspring.
“The more dangerous it is even when flying into orbit,” concludes cosmonaut Waleri Polyakov, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet humanity must look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the generation of artificial gravity.
The hydro laboratory in the cosmonaut preparation centre is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here in a suspended state, the cosmonauts gain routine for working in open space.
The water represents weightlessness.
Although adults feel water is pleasant, it is a foreign environment; yet infants feel water as a natural element.
It is as if the little Ichtyander bear witness to the fact that life on the land eluded the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is about 9 months in the womb of the mother in the amniotic fluid, and the fact that it can then be more easily used to water.
In principle, this is logical, since from birth until the first swim only 2 weeks pass.
“This is not enough time to forget something,” says baby swimming instructor Marina Aksenowa.
While for a newborn child, weightlessness is thus a much more natural condition, the woman does not get out without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles form back enormously quickly and thus also the ability to squeeze out the child decreases.
All right, let's deal with this through birth-initiating aids.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special chamber to squeeze the child out.
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant question of Waleri Poljakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the grounding, the organism cannot train the skeleton and muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put into a strain suit in orbit like an adult for training.
He will simply lack what is of fundamental importance to his life.
“This experiment, which we are conducting together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to give birth to a disabled person, a completely unadjusted person,” said Igor Pestow, head of the Bioethics Commission of the RAN Institute for Medical-Biological Problems.
So far, the birth of children in space is mere theory.
At some point, however, it becomes a reality when the Earth dwellers in their spaceships break up into a distant planet that will be the home for their offspring born in space.
NK<0xC3><0x9A> chief: Control of the black system fails due to political debt
The Czech Republic has good control authorities and adequate laws in connection with public contracts, but falls back in their application.
In the conversation for Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, the Vice-President of the Supreme Control Office (Nejvy<0xC5><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD> kontrolln<0xC3><0xAD> <0xC3><0xBA><0xC5><0x99>ad, NK<0xC3><0x9A>), Miloslav Kala, says this.
“A law is never perfect, but it has to be properly applied – and this is not the case with us, in my opinion,” Kala comments on the current situation.
A similar result appears to be a joint control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative practical example, he leads the appointment of Prime Minister Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as to the so-called "black system".
Recently, the prime minister said that the ODS would not harass entrepreneurs with controls - is the system now banned or allowed?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then it cannot simply come to the head of government, and the office of control, whose duty now is to control compliance with the law, hinders its activity," Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you discussed a joint Czech-German project in which the laws of both countries on public contracts were compared.
What was it about specifically?
This is a parallel test, with which we started about two years ago.
To put it simply, it is a matter of the European legislature setting out how public contracts are to be handled, building on this the national legislations, and finally the actual practical application.
We have compared all of this, and although the test is not yet completed, we have found extremely interesting differences. In general, the laws in us are perhaps even more "strict and perfect", but the actual application is better in some parameters in Germany.
This confirms that it is not enough to set up new and more precise rules over and over again, and one must also deal with the actual application of the law.
To what extent can the project help you? What results from this project for you?
Such joint control could help us to stop constantly striving to perfect the laws and to reduce and autarate thresholds if this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Economic efficiency means acquiring a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts.
But lowering thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we will achieve this goal as well.
Perhaps it is even the case that in this way we only burden the system with excessive "paper cramps", and those who seek gaps in the system have it much easier to exploit the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech procurement law.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority to our NK<0xC3><0x9A>, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart to the NK<0xC3><0x9A> is the Federal Court of Auditors, which is similar to ours and also has a college, which is only slightly different.
The competences are also comparable to a certain extent, but Germany is a federal state, i.e. these accounting offices also exist in the individual federal states - in this the German system differs from ours.
The BRH is only allowed to control federal funds, which corresponds to our state funds.
Public funds managed by the districts and municipalities are subject to the control of the state accounting offices.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would like to compare this without specific information. Nevertheless, Germany is often referred to as an example in some respects, but it is certainly not possible to say that Germany is better in everything.
Is it because the examiners are better?
This is certainly not the case, but as I said, I do not like such comparisons very much.
It should also be noted that those countries that are an example to us also have problems with this.
Otherwise, they wouldn’t have anything to do with our agency, would they?
As far as Czech legislation is concerned, what was the significance of the amendment of the awarding law for your authority, do you already feel any impact?
In view of the fact that this novel is only in effect for a short time, it has not yet had an effect on our tests.
Since our controls take place later, a certain delay must be expected here.
To date, we are more likely to feel the effects in the preparatory phase of future controls - this is how we have introduced the new control tool "Identification of risks of inefficiency" and with this almost 14,000 public contracts are examined and analysed - here the changes will of course have an effect, as the thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, among other things.
Do you see the adoption of this law rather positively, or is the system burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption is confirmed.
However, the problem can occur that the rules become “stricter” and can no longer be observed.
Already under the previous rules, the persons subject to an audit are accountable to the institution (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) to the effect that any non-compliance with the procurement law is equivalent to a violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense to make the law even stricter?
I do not think that way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not punish those who have committed a form error that does not affect actual decision-making.
Such a system only puts the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out?
First of all, let’s say which path is not a good one.
The prime minister recently said that the ODS would not brighten the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black system" - what exactly does that mean?
Is the black system banned or allowed?
A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then it cannot simply come to the head of government, and the office of control, whose duty is now to control the law, can hinder its activity.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the thing," but he can't say that we do as if nothing were.
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain operations - and this is also correct for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, however, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer is excluded solely due to form errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be properly applied - and that is what I think we lack.
On the roads, there is a certain amount of ice, but mostly they are dry.
On the streets of the Czech Republic there is partly snow and ice.
Mostly, however, the roads are well-travelable, sometimes increased caution is required.
Carlsbad
In the district of Karlovy Vary, the roads were easy to drive this morning, and there were occasional snow and ice flats.
Temperatures dropped to -5 to -10 °C, during the day it should be a little warmer.
In the region it no longer snows, and in the lower altitudes only a thin snow cover remains.
However, on the ridges of the Erzgebirge lies about 30 cm of snow.
According to the district road guard, there was limited visibility due to fog.
The R6 motorway and the first-class roads in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention is paid, for example, to bridges on which the roadways are sometimes required and smooth.
All traffic routes of the second and third street classes, including the mountain roads, are also accessible.
On these roads, however, some required or extended snow remains.
In particular, increased attention is therefore required in the higher positions.
Districts Pardubice and Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové
On some roads East Böhmens there is a danger because of ice levels, in higher locations and in the mountains there is sometimes still an extended layer of snow on the roads, the Road and Highway Directorate reports on their websites.
The roadmasters warn drivers of ice slickness, which can occur especially in higher locations in the district of Pardubice.
Ice plains can be reached especially on second and third-class roads in the districts of Lan<0xC5><0xA1>kroun, <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Orlic<0xC3><0xAD>, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ka, Svitavy and Vysoké M<0xC3><0xBD>to.
Streets I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow lies especially on the roads in the Giant Mountains and in the mountains of Orlické hory.
An extended layer of snow lies at altitudes on the roads of the districts of Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov.
In Eastern Bohemia today it is mostly sunny or cheerful, and it remains largely rain-free.
Temperatures move between -3 and +1 °C, it blows a weak wind.
Pilsen district
The roads in the district of Pilsen are well-travelable today, but local attention is given, and the driving style is adapted to the weather.
This is frosty in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing.
Since it has snowed before and the temperatures subsequently fell, it can come to ice plains on the roads.
Locally, fog is also to be expected, but the view will improve over the day.
This information comes from the District Road Masters.
The D5 motorway is practically unrestricted, but increased attention is recommended by the roadmasters between the 80th and 131st kilometres.
The roadways of the first class are mostly dry, but frozen.
In the south of the districts of Pilsen and Tachov, however, it can come in sections to ice plains.
The roadways of the second and third road classes are damp, and therefore the reference to possible required sections applies here as well.
Drivers should be especially careful mainly on the less frequented roads in the Bohemian Forest area.
Olomouc
Today, snow-matsch has to count on drivers who are traveling towards the altitudes in the Olomouc district.
After the use of stray vehicles, Snowmash remains on the <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo pass as well as on the road towards Videlsk<0xC3><0xBD> k<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>.
Nocturnal snow drift forced the roadmasters to use, in the <0xC5><0xA0>umperk district about 3 cm of new snow fell, according to the road administration.
In the other areas of the district, the roads are usually fully accessible.
"In the district of <0xC5><0xA0>umperk there are still snow remnants left in the high altitudes.
On the <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo pass, drivers have to expect snowmash towards Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k," a road administration employee told the <0xC4><0x8C>TK agency today.
Their colleagues in the Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k district also had to get out at night, according to their data, the roads are free and wet to the altitudes after chemical treatment.
In Olomouc, the roads are fully accessible, but in <0xC5><0xA0>ternberk, the drivers have to drive carefully in forest sections, as the roads are still wet.
<0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem, Liberec District
In northern Bohemia, the roadmasters report several poorly accessible sections of the road.
In addition to several places with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice is blocked in the district of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> n.K., according to the traffic police.
The temperatures remain below zero even in lower positions, so that snow and ice will stay on the roads. From the lowlands, especially southeast of the Bohemian Central Mountains, no problems are reported, and the roads are usually dry there.
No traffic disruptions have been reported so far.
Ice smoothness is reported in particular from the vicinity of <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>t<0xC3><0xAD>.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this at night - rain and melting snow during the day, cloudless sky and frost at night.
Bad traffic conditions are reported from the main routes as well as from I/13 on the border of the districts of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> n.L. and Liberec.
The closure of the road between Telnice and Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice was necessary due to branches that were pushed from the snow load to the roadway.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest: At our concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think will happen in less than a month of the end of the world?
This is one of those disasters that we humans are so fond of.
With our band The Tap Tap, we’re more likely to make fun of it and say that we’re the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the end of the world.
In December you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce the project to our readers?
This is a national benefit event, which we have been planning for two years.
For this, we want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, whose end is forecast for December 21st at 11:10 a.m.
On the day before, i.e. on December 20th, three concerts will take place in Prague, Brno and Ostrava at the same time from 21:00.
The end of the concerts is said to be about the time when the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is in a time zone around 12 hours ahead of us.
From whom does this idea come?
Originally probably from me, then we designed the idea together with our graphic artist Honza Augusta.
Not only do we want to gather enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, but we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we once pass this world on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, t-shirts, bags and keychains against the end of the world, with which people can also support us through www.e-tap.cz.
The band The Tap Tap, together with other artists, has also recorded the so-called anthem against the end of the world entitled "The end of the world falls out".
Even today, the anthem is very popular on YouTube. Will it also sound on the benefit concerts?
Of course, at the very end, provided that everything works and the end of the world does not take place...
The hymn is to be sung by all performers at all three concerts at the same time.
In addition, the hymns are broadcast live together in a live broadcast by Czech TV.
The lyrics of the hymn come from Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Han<0xC3><0xA1>k, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also sings Xindl X with...
How did you come to work with both of them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we realize many benefit events and concerts...
We strive to involve these people intensively in our projects.
It has been shown that most people are interested in working with us and have fun with it.
What is the purpose of the proceeds of the concerts against the end of the world?
For the establishment of the accessible educational centre Studeo, where we have been working together with the association Tap at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute for six years.
The students of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute are regularly supervised by lecturers who help them with various leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the lecturers, we would like to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, a separate building is to be built, into which we will then move in with this project.
At each concert, several groups and performers appear.
What criteria did you choose?
We wanted to put together a program that appeals to all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, support lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan B<0xC3><0xA1>rta, The Tap Tap Tap, Mari<0xC3><0xA1>n Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Such<0xC3><0xBD> appear.
You can find out more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar “big events” planned for the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Prague Spring, and we will also prepare an interesting programme with interesting guests for this concert.
Next year we would also like to perform at the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are already in the USA - would like to combine this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not exactly small, so far you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group made up of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these journeys logistically and organizationally?
It’s not as bad as it seems at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be transported in the luggage compartment. In addition, of course, we must carry many instrument cases and other luggage...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without any problems so far, <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us, that I have sometimes already wondered.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your travels abroad, you have a comparison of what it looks like in the individual countries with accessibility, how to deal with disabled people there, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxemburg, London and other cities where everything works better than with us, we witnessed in Russia that in the East everything is still in its beginnings.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is absolutely not suitable for disabled people, where it is still unusual if someone is in a wheelchair alone in the city centre.
It is not even a matter of course that a wheelchair user is allowed in the elevator, for example.
Fortunately, there are also clubs that try to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way do we need to catch up with the developed countries?
There are a lot of things that we hang behind...
However, it should also be noted that improving the situation always depends on the efforts of those affected.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely common for people with severe disabilities to move independently in public space, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
However, it is not quite common for a larger group of disabled people to participate actively in social events, in which we are a bit ahead of the West with the band The Tap Tap!
Respect in public and accessibility is one thing, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks will things really start to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly strong personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if we go back a few years: what motivated you to start a band in 1998?
At that time, I started as a supervisor at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in dealing with something intensely.
And since I am a musician myself and play saxophone, among other things, I founded a music company together with a colleague.
Well, and over time, as our moderator, L<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>, used to say, something got out of control (laughs).
However, the band only became known in recent years, or am I mistaken?
It is true that working with well-known singers has helped us, and we have also started to actively promote ourselves.
We have become aware that if you do something and you can’t see it outward, your own performance doesn’t exist in a certain sense.
Thanks to EU funding, we can also afford good editors, high-quality equipment and etc.
Was it your goal to bring it so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I have felt the potential to do things differently.
In the show business, one often copies the other.
This is logical in its own way, since everything new is looked at with caution and accepted only after a long time.
There are only a few really unique things, and I dare to claim that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression that the viewer usually has is of course pity; this is only natural...
But this pity is absolutely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we should regret.
They are people who can live and develop a full life if they have the necessary means to do so.
I always say that if people with disabilities succeed, this is not only a step forward for them, but for society as a whole.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you cannot compromise on many things and you also have to demand a certain discipline.
I think this is perfectly normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and when they find that they have a rehearsal twice a week, have to complete preparation phases and spend a lot of time on concert trips, then the enthusiasm of many quickly fades away.
But that’s how it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
How many of them have been there since the beginning of 1998?
Only one: L<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
We're an open group, people come and go, you can't prevent that.
Whoever has the will and the desire to participate is always welcome with us.
Takes place the day before the predicted end of the world, Thursday the 20.12.2012 at 9 pm
Venues are: Incheba-Arena/Prague, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues are finally connected via live circuit and a common interpretation of the anthem "World's End Is Falling Out" by the band The Tap Tap.
The aim of the concert is to raise the funds for the provision of a multifunctional disability-friendly educational centre, which is to be created under the name STUDEO at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute in Prague.
Admission costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free of charge, tickets are available in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and Space.
Last week, Poland was admitted as the 20th member of the European Space Agency at a Council of Ministers meeting of the Member States of the European Space Agency (ESA), making it the second member state from the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became ESA member on 12 November 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
Poland’s journey into space began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmos enthusiasts were engaged in space travel, not always coming across understanding.
I recall, for example, the lecture by A. <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld of 6 December 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, in which the author presented thoughts from his pioneering work "Entrance to Cosmonautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the audience cold, and after years <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
<0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld won the Prix REP-Hirsch, founded by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch, in 1934 for "Entrance to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish journals he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski’s globally recognized contribution to the development of space travel was appreciated, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named after him.
Already in 1925 a railway taxi was built in Poland, for which a rocket propulsion was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to launch or brake the drains.
The information on this comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-powered missiles.
The research was carried out by the Institute Kom<0xC3><0xB3>rka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
It can be seen from the documents handed down that the research had progressed to the stage of practical testing.
The research was then, of course, interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, in the trade press, the design of a photoelectric hunting dragon by Ing. Rohozi<0xC5><0x84>ski appeared, and the following year the work "Rakieta - torpedoa powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects dealt with the military use of rocket propulsion.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of rocket technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of work, its work was terminated from the beginning of the war.
Further articles on spaceflight appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Agency (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first mention of this company takes place in 1954 in the November issue of the journal Problemy, in which four extensive articles on space travel are dedicated.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to establish a space company.
At the time, there were already the first satellite technology projects, and it was to be expected that space exploration would have a future.
Already in its beginnings in 1956, the Polish space company PTA sought to join the International Federation for Space, founded in 1951, and in fact, the PTA became a regular member in the fall of 1956.
The following year, the first PTA Chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the Deputy Chairman of the International Federation for Space.
He held this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been instrumental in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and did not weigh quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959, flight tests began in the B<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>d<0xC3><0xB3>w Desert with the two-stage RM-2 rocket.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another development stage should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used for the observation of high winds.
In 1962, however, further development was discontinued.
The successor to the first type RM rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the take-off weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed from this rocket, which differed from each other in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a transport space with 0.4 liters of capacity, Meteor-1B over 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C over 0.62 liters.
The maximum flight altitude was 37 km for all three types.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Institute of Aviation, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to an altitude of about 60 km.
After that, the versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also worth noting that Poland’s accession to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 followed by the establishment of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
Poland also participated in space exploration with Soviet satellites as part of the Intercosmos programme, and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermazevsky became second intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Remek.
The repeal of the law on charitable works is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the law on non-profit works.
This decision sparked a lively discussion in the public eye.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
The liberally oriented economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict with each other.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with unbridled financial speculation.
Due to the large differences in the value of work (rewards), there are price tensions.
This term is to be understood as a condition in which the manufacturer tries to compete in economic competition by importing cheap goods by "subsidising competition" in order to increase its market share and increase its profit.
On a large scale, this means for most companies to relocate their production abroad or buy cheaply there, or to abandon their business. The result is high unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Since private capital bears no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment caused by it, government expenditure necessarily increases.
This situation is reinforced by the fact that the entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thereby replace the overall social and economic damage caused by them.
This situation is generally known, so that specific statistics are unnecessary at this point.
The ruthless practice of private capital creates in the individual economies a situation in which governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments deliver private capital to their own people without regard to the social consequences.
This is particularly evident in changes in the laws in force.
The aim of these measures is to force one's own population to accept the dictates of private capital, especially in the field of wages.
This is done on the one hand by economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, on the other hand by the circumcision of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between the rich and the poor.
In Germany there have been public food outlets for the poor for several years now, which are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
In the course of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases in which workers receive such a low wage that the state must increase their income to the minimum of existence.
Such a scandal was also revealed in the case of aid workers employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all EU Southern States will undoubtedly go out to the same state where people are forced to emigrate under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of their social level (as was the case in the 19th century), or for a hunger wage on the fringes of society, hoping that at some point private investment capital will flow into the country.
Naturally, this raises the question of where this capital comes from.
If it comes from another EU country, only poverty migrates from one country to another; or capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or in Africa, workers are actually working for a fraction of European wages.
This is all about Latin America.
Liberal theories and media allege that the state must not participate in its own economy with capital, and that the planned economy leads to an economic disaster.
Private capital insists firmly on its position that the state must not intervene in the economy.
But then one has to wonder whether private capital does not influence or even direct politics and thus the entire state in its own selfish sense.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and ubiquitous lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual advantage, a legislation in which virtually everything is criminal but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that a Ministry of State, in the absence of finance, commissions private legal entities, closely intertwined with industry, to draft legislation.
These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.
All violence then no longer comes from the people, as the Western constitutions proclaim, but from strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Apparently, the liberal democracies are now quickly entering a situation, as Appian describes in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesar and Pompey: "The state had long been in disintegration, and the offices were occupied with force.
Against lubricating money, by unlawful encroachment of advantages or with stone and sword.
Corruption grew imperceptibly, and the people went with already bought votes for election" ... "People with character did not apply for offices, so that as a result of this decline the state did not have a consul for eight months" ... "One really began to talk about the fact that the only medicine in this difficult situation was a sole rule, and that a strong man had to be elected" ...
As it turns out, today’s society, as in ancient times, is founded on the ruthless preference of one’s own advantage, without paying attention to the interests of society as a whole.
Private capital, by its very nature, is not able to recognize and enforce the advantage for the whole of society.
The result, today as it was then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, who are not in the least striving for deeper reforms.
We must therefore seek the cause of the emergence of fascism and communism in the ruthless liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From today’s perspective, the downfall of these regimes in favor of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain pause in which the next round is already taking place.
Especially catastrophic is the fact that today’s elites face the possible loss of hundreds of thousands of lives in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters we already witness today, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know them from older and more recent history, in complete ignorance.
The repeal of the law on charitable works is not a solution here, at least not a permanent one.
Under pressure from global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will continue to seek ways to push the social level of the population down.
This trend is therefore system-related.
The only solution is targeted political-social reforms that increase the state’s capital participation in the economy, increase citizens’ influence on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: Labor of Chaos.
"...that nothing arises out of violence, or could ever arise," Sting sings in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the chorus reads: "...so that we may not forget how fragile we are."
“If my sons did not want war, there would be none,” says the dying Goodle Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, a number of reactions.
Some stand behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defense, while calling the Palestinians terrorists; others in turn support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and call the state of Israel terrorist.
I do not want to write at this point about who is guilty and who is a victim in these ever-recurring waves of killing; ultimately, today’s residents of Israel, including the self-government areas, have been born into the current political situation and have not experienced the onset of violence itself.
It is my job to open the eyes of the readers behind the scenes, the look at who the 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small patch of land in the Middle East are above all useful.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from these and emerge from my own understanding of who or what group of people significantly influences the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
In every era we can make an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less obvious is the question of whether it was really always these personalities themselves who determined their steps autonomously, or whether behind their throne was someone who directed their actions towards a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power has not arisen within the lifetime of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out a particular one that could be described as the head of the Kraken (I don’t know if anyone else is above them, but I don’t rule this out) – the Rothschilds.
Much is not written about them.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was bought by the Rothschilds as early as the 90s of the 19th century to prevent the combination of their name with highly criminal acts, in the background of which was always the consolidation of their power, the increase of their wealth or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they wage wars or arm themselves against them (before the raid on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the raid on Iraq there were 5 countries, after the fall of Ghaddafi only four remained, with Russia in the meantime subordinated its central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to confront this family had to pay with life for it.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschild's Bank of America as a central bank, began to issue his own banknotes during the Civil War, and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the FED - he was assassinated in 1963; MP Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for triggering the world economic crisis in 1929.
The Rothschilds’ global lust for power led to the formulation of a plan to unleash three world wars by Albert Pik, a Mason of the 33rd and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war aimed to eliminate the great monarchist statesmen of Europe, the second war in particular was to break Britain's colonial rule, and the third war was to reduce the world's population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would provide for their conveniences and luxury and would also not consume so many resources), eventually create a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a prelude to this).
The method by which the group of wealthiest families works with the Rothschilds at the top is the triggering of a crisis and the subsequent offering of a solution (order from chaos - order from chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the establishment of the FED, so that crises like those triggered by them in 1907 do not repeat themselves).
After they succeeded in triggering World War I by the murder of the Habsburg heir Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian Tsarist Empire by the revolution of the Bolsheviks.
The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unfounded capitulation of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian Tsarist Empire the war was no longer necessary), after which the Central European Great Power of Austria-Hungary was dissolved.
In order to facilitate the Second World War, the bankers had to create a latent conflict situation through politics, by occupying Germany with gigantic war repairs; by doing so, they created the condition of impoverished masses, so that they only had to cheer the Germans with a sufficiently strong leader, who named the guilty and offered simple solutions; another factor was the creation of a Twelfth People's State.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the founding of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought to establish a Jewish state, possibly in the historical area of Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration created the prerequisite for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; first clashes with the resident Arab population occurred.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler broke free from the chain at which the international bankers had initially held him, or whether everything went according to plan, is difficult to estimate, in any case the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as the war-repairs against Germany paved the way for the Second World War, the proclamation of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for the Third World War.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish people will be the victims in the front line of battle, this time together with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East, just like in World War II.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just remember how sharply people divide into followers and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, where injustice only causes injustice in an endless spiral of violence, with the greed of individuals and their desire for global power in the beginning?
Here one must distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, but the international bankers in Israel as well as with us, the people, exclusively elect their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the Falke Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist-prone, world-based politician loyal to international bankers, who is doing everything to spark a war with Iran, who could quickly expand into a global conflict in the face of Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), and with it's horus of global conflict.
In what light do the words of David Rockefeller from 1994 appear: "The only thing we need is an all-encompassing crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
In their imagination, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every newborn at birth is implanted a chip to subject this being to total control.
"And it makes that the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the servants all give themselves a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, that no one can buy or sell, but he has the mark, that is, the name of the beast or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom: he that hath understanding, let him consider the number of the beast.
For it is a man's number, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six."
The movie Argo: If it's worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of protesting Islamist students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, they demanded the extradition of the overthrown Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, who had maintained the patronage of his regime for decades.
For the American government, there was no positive way out of this situation - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, as this would have massively damaged the trust of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, she was unable to enforce the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a severe blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent failure in the violent attempt to free the hostages only made everything worse.
The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days after negotiations had been brokered by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments at home.
Debacle in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter’s defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo by director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the United States a small partial victory.
Immediately before the embassy was occupied, six ambassadors managed to escape.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to bring the refugees out of Iran, helping them uncover their true identity with an extravagant story – they traveled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a film staff who allegedly visited film locations in the country for a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan developed by the expert for “exfiltration,” Tony Mendez, also required Hollywood’s collaboration.
To make the camouflage credible, articles about this film project appeared in journals, press conferences were held, and the fictitious production company had a real office.
The details of this operation were kept secret for a long time, based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic police thriller, but at the same time also a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful Hussar piece such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
This changes the mood levels in the film - on the one hand the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and also in the film version of the same situations there are no big differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which come ironically and slightly overstimulated.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, on the office floors, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has made a remarkable start to his career with this film.
A smiling actor has become a respectable director, and even as an actor, he is no longer the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the crime No Child's Play (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller city without Grace (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film, which does not play in the director's Boston home.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place was one of the features that lifted the previous films of this director from the standard Hollywood.
However, Affleck also proves this feeling in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have really taken place - the entrance sequence of the embarrassment of the message is very impressive in its clarity, yet still conveys the feeling of confusion and the unpredictability that occurs when the story moves somewhere.
Affleck and his team have a similar effect on fictional scenes (the wrong film staff on a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story does not actually offer many exciting scenes in the cinematic sense.
But with the little he works quite successfully, sometimes helping the reality - which doesn't always seem so elegant (the scenes in which the impending crisis at the airport in Tehran is turned away by a phone call in America, or even the chase on the runway, seem somewhat contrived).
The weakness of Argo is its overly broad spread, which is due to the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their characters deserve more space, and thus they are by far not alone in the film.
Affleck’s film loses some traction, which is a film that can be watched with some interest, and the design and retro style reminiscent of a thriller from the 70’s.
However, he awakens enthusiasm only with difficulty.
However, as a reminder of a piece of history that is alive to this day, and as proof of how exaggerated the ideas of the omnipotent and omniscient intelligence services are, it is sufficient.
Guidelines for inflating balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which publishes an annual survey of the most absurd bank charges, decided this year to host the competition "Absurdest regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
“This idea brought us to the EU’s recent plan to introduce a 40% women’s rate in the management of large European companies,” said Patrik Nacher, who is responsible for organizing this survey, to the Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo newspaper.
Among the listed absurdities is, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the uniformity of insurance rates for men and women.
Until then, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance because they objectively represent a lower risk for insurance companies.
"More incredible incidents from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place until the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Controversial EU regulations include the binding addition of bioethanol to fuels which are inherently harmful, and the banning of reliable mercury thermometers simply because they contain a relatively small amount of this hazardous substance, or the directive on the size of chicken cages, which made eggs much more expensive this year.
In the past, criticism also caught on to the factual ban on the use of the term "butter spread" or the ban on the sale of conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose demands are usually represented in Brussels by one or more member countries (for example, the Czech Republic is currently trying to enforce the demands of Czech banks with a veto threat).
Lobbying interests were also behind the fact that bananas of the highest commercial class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not have a "curvation anomaly".
The European Commission defended itself with the argument that they only harmonize the inconsistent national standards that would hinder trade.
The standards on fruit and vegetables have already been softened by the EU against the resistance of some countries with the indication that the previous directives would lead to food waste.
A candidate for victory in this survey may be the EU regulation of the past year, which, according to balloons, must be provided at the time of sale with the indication that children under the age of eight must not inflate the balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU called for an American study that, according to balloons, is the leading cause of childhood suffocation.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age when using annual market straws.
Curiosities also occur at home
Relatively absurd is also a directive that affects European officials themselves - anyone who has an official role in the EU must not use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the subject for Greece and must instead say FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovn<0xC3><0xAD>poplatky.com server, in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists Laissez Faire, also nominated the EU regulation on the extent of food supplies in the territory of a member country.
The EU thus set the maximum volume of food supplies that were allowed to be in the Czech Republic on the day of our EU accession.
The Czech Republic then, for example, exceeded the fixed volume for canned mushrooms, for which we were threatened with a high fine.
The survey organizers were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or by the idea of giving funding for applications for funding.
Of course, these ideas did not come from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by the fact that we do not have a sea.
We will apply for a refund to the EU," said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he argued that the grain harvest was very high and the state stockpiles were overcrowded as a result of so-called intervention purchases.
Since the Czech Republic has another way to seaports, the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros to us, according to Palas.
The European Commission finally met the Czech Republic so far that it organised a call for tenders for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Funding for applications for funding was offered to the municipalities by the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel N<0xC4><0x9B>mec (US-DEU), in concrete terms it should be a means for the setting up of funding applications to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
While regulations are easily becoming the target of criticism in the Member States, the EU’s efforts to regulate and thus to ensure the effectiveness and development of the European Union as a whole deserve more recognition.
In the opinion of these experts, a more serious problem is the EU funding for projects which have nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, but which have been forced into the budget negotiations of individual Member States.
Emotions in this country also call for the fact that the Czech Republic, like other member countries in Brussels, must fight for the right to use specific designations of traditional products and do not always win this fight.
After a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké tvar<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xBE>ky", the Inl<0xC3><0xA4>nderrum (Tuzemsk<0xC3><0xBD> rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, but our manufacturers had to rename it "Tuzem<0xC3><0xA1>k".
The term rum may only be used for sugarcane distillate products, not for sugar beet products.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the company of the world famous cheeses Feta and Gorgonzola, Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham now also includes the Karlovy Vary Zwieback, carp from Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice and T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88>, or also the Saaz hops.
With an EU brand, the pardubicer can brew gingerbread or the Ho<0xC5><0x99>icer rolls.
"People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," Okamura claims.
Senator, how do you come up with the idea of running for president?
It’s not about being a senator or president.
If everything in our country would work without problems, I would not run anywhere.
But I can no longer look at how the Republic has been plundered for 20 years, how thieves run around freely, while people increase taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But if I see something that I don’t like, I try to suggest a solution to change that.
And since I’m already over 40, and independent and impartial, I have no other way of influencing things than running for the office of a senator or president.
You made it to the Senate and then you made your way to the castle.
Do you not turn your back on your constituents?
I've been telling myself all along that I'm going to take up the fight for the castle after the outcome of the Senate elections.
Later, I clarified this and said that I would run for the office of president if I was elected senator.
However, my goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
For this I need as much influence as possible and a mandate as strong as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not only that we as a people in the pub and in front of the TV, but that we are blaming everyone who wants to change something.
In addition, there are the media who want to rob you of the honor and who confuse the freedom of the word with the freedom to lie.
For example, it was claimed that I would bribe journalists or that I was an adviser to Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek.
Let’s talk about your visions.
The battle for the castle has taken place with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive declarations of assets over 20 million kroner.
You have to change laws.
As president, you have no competence in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can make legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I committed myself to ensuring that the guide remains a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is small-minded politics - if someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent party-looseer, I have a far greater potential to gain support from all parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take from any party what is best for our country without thinking about drawers and party dogmas.
Do you see yourself as a person in politics rather right or left?
From a Czech perspective, I think people are more likely to see me on the left.
For me, however, this right-left thinking is completely unimportant.
For me, it is important that we move on.
It’s not about whether someone belongs to the left or the right camp; I want to connect people.
I always publicly support every good approach, even if it comes from the KS<0xC4><0x8C>M or the ODS, and so I will turn to bad ideas.
You are mistaken if someone calls you a populist.
But don't you confirm that by what you just said?
When you create a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And you want to approach that.
One can call this populism for my sake, but all the proposals I have spoken of are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without Parliament’s support, you will only be left with slogans.
That way, you won’t get far in politics in the long run.
Or do you think that if you only talk to people long enough, you will succeed in enforcing, for example, material and criminal liability?
I have no other option.
Convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to bring them to our side in order to achieve these goals.
As president, it would not be a problem for me to ask the chairmen of the parliamentary parties live on television to legally anchor the substantive and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And the people who are talking about it may have to say why they refuse to do so.
A strong personality, pointing to grievances, can put pressure on the political scene.
Only take the direct election of the president, which was a merit of public pressure.
I say clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just started politics and am trying to find the support of the majority for my program.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it doesn’t work out, I’ll go back to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a little like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know that I can’t achieve anything on my own, so I talked to several well-known personalities about whether they don’t want to run for the Senate.
I spoke, for example, with Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, who, however, refused because of work overload.
In addition, I supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencov<0xC3><0xA1>, who discovered the fraud in trading light fuel oil.
I started my candidacy on the premise that people are deeply unhappy, but now I am no longer sure.
Sixty percent of the electorate have not gone to the elections at all, and those who have gone have mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of mayors and district principals.
Are you thinking about starting your own party?
I haven’t thought about it yet because I don’t have time to review the past of every potential party member, and I don’t have the money for it.
I don’t even have money for the presidential campaign; in my transparent account there are only 20,000 CZK.
You don't have any money?
You are talking about asset statements, what do you look like?
I estimate my private assets to be around CZK 60 million.
In Prague I have a plot of land worth 25 million, an apartment worth about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a <0xC5><0xA0>kodu Superb worth about one million. And then I have a few million more in my account.
By the way, Aston Martin was a childhood dream - James Bond has always liked me as he drove in the car, was gallant to women and at the same time fought against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and don’t have any money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don’t want to invest your own money in it.
That's not exactly convincing.
I don’t have $15 million for the campaign.
Should I make a debt?
I’ve already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have sponsors shows that my program probably doesn’t arouse too much interest.
And I am not obliged to deny the campaign by my own means.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I couldn’t live on the Senator’s salary alone; I couldn’t finance my son, for example, the English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I wouldn't run for anything.
So do you continue to work as an entrepreneur to get your income?
Didn't you say you're going to go back to these activities?
But that is not related to the amount of salary.
As promised, I have partially withdrawn my activities.
For example, my deputy will become Managing Director of the travel agency in the spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I also have to live on something.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that continues to be the case.
However, as President, I would completely cease my activities.
The full conversation can be found in the Saturday edition of Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not only in mind - using the example of Spijkenisse and the recently built Buchenberg - 2 photos
“I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there’s something interesting to see again,” says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the roadside.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician in a nearby large-scale company, says, "Well, it's nice, the house."
But I wonder what we still need a library for today.
Everyone has internet, iPad and e-books.
No one goes to one of these old-style libraries today, right?
Spijkenisse, a hardly in need of a visit to a sleep town in front of the gates of Rotterdam, is a remarkable record holder.
The 80,000-resident community has the lowest education rate in the whole of the Netherlands.
To counter this stupid circumstance, a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to general education and to recreate the seven fictitious bridges depicted on the euro notes as nicely-paved reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational campaign was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to become master of statistics: a library had to be created!
Winy Maas from Rotterdam’s architectural firm MVRDV, master of the bold bar charts and producer of funny, often cynical buildings, took the case with familiar serenity and appeared for competitive hearing in 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the jury was still gloomy looking around and wagging with the axils, the cheeky maas piled up his exquisite carry-on of greatness to a pyramid and ended his actionist-backed speech with the words: "Dear city community!"
So this is my proposal for the Buchenberg von Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain is stored up.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Bücherberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus, the faceless small-town retort, which up to now had nothing more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian zone and a stately ugly town hall, behind which white facades one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory to make a piece of contemporary architecture richer.
Above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural construction in the history of its existence.
The Long Way to the Book
First impression: Bookeldorado under cheese bell.
Although there is a lift that leads through the middle of the mountain massif, the true pleasures of space and reading are unlocked when climbing the topography on foot.
The all-glass interior is bright and clear, the burnt clinker floor and the elegant street lamps speak the language of a public city square unmistakably.
The urban ambience is perfect.
You are already looking for park bench, dog and football-playing boys and girls.
And everywhere books, books, books.
“Normally, the bookshelves are standing along the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade, and in the middle is a large, dark space that is usually uncomfortable and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
We turned the classic room configuration upside down and pushed the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the Bücherberg is cleverly used: In the middle are offices, internet library, chess club, environmental center and building technology center.
A special delight are the black bookshelves, which are sometimes wall cladding, sometimes bristling, sometimes ladder railings.
Optics, haptics and smells are foreign.
Even incarcerated architects and civil engineers shake their heads about the unknown building material.
“We wanted to work with recycling materials here,” explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
And so, in a Frisian farm, one day we encountered a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years, a millimeter-thin plastic fleece has been used in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands as a root pad.
This is cheap and time efficient.
The thin textile lasts one, two seasons, after which it is ripe for the barrier waste.
For the library, the fleece was pressed into four centimeters thick plates for the first time in these quantities.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, resilient material that smells like a new car and a new shoe.
After 105 steps, you reach the summit.
At the end of the almost 500 meters long walk, you will be rewarded in the literature café not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and potted ficus trees.
They provide atmosphere, but above all the right humidity in the literary mountains.
Donations for the New Soul
“You wouldn’t believe it, but this house is a showcase project in terms of ecology despite the many glass surfaces,” says Trouborst.
Heated and cooled with geothermal heat.
Although the Buchenberg is under a glass fall, even on sunny days, the sun appears only briefly inside.
The wide wooden glue binders, which are located across the glass facade, serve as shade and capture much of the sunlight.
The room climate is very pleasant.
The rest are fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic from the IT industry, already ventured the way into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who calls Boekenberg even as Spijkenisse's "long overdue soul".
The reason: To open a few weeks ago, each resident was invited to donate a book from his personal stock.
For the time being, the optical gaps in the library that has not yet been fully stocked – currently 70,000 pieces – are to be filled.
The concept has begun.
The shelves are filled to the top.
“Nothing is worse than a half empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just for decoration.
Thus, MVRDV succeeded in the royal discipline, which is called the identity foundation in the technical jargon.
Spijkenisse has written literary history.
As young and uneducated as she may be.
This is finally a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans need to play a bigger role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert on US-European relations, Berlin is thus balancing on a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had initially signalled that it would vote against the request for an observer status of the Palestinians at the United Nations.
Then there was Berlin.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be cautious because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don’t think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence – without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to setting up a no-fly zone.
This was eventually enforced by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is precisely shifting its foreign policy away from a policy managed, so to speak, by the United States, to a German foreign policy.
What is more, Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
So the Germans find themselves between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still playing their part, but they are on their way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy such as France or Great Britain.
What does a “normal” foreign policy actually mean from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness to take positions in national interests that are independent of those of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other great powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests had an impact on the attitude in the Middle East conflict and voting in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large sales markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
Therefore, it must be careful not to blow up the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
This definitely plays a role.
But I wouldn’t want to attach too much weight to it either, that’s not a completely one-sided relationship.
But it certainly plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by abstaining from important decisions, such as voting on Palestine?
I believe that there is a great deal of understanding of the German position in Europe and even in the USA.
Therefore, I do not believe that this was such a dramatic break as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even have some respect for it.
Because it signals that it needs to be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be considered.
There are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The United States, on the other hand, has clearly voted for a veto.
Are there disagreements between the United States and many European nations?
Because of American domestic politics, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama administration secretly has quite a lot of understanding of the European position.
But due to the political situation here, the government cannot publicly represent this position.
I believe that the actual differences of opinion are not as great as they always appear.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then Obama is not so keen on Netanyahu’s politics.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand, and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
This is what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a bit easier for Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not currently the case.
So they can’t be part of a broader line and instead have to push things out of their own position.
This is what they are doing with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will play a leading role in pushing Europe to a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, even because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I think the Germans are clear that they need to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself in the role of an important international player - does Germany want to take on a leading role at all?
Or is Germany still hard on the leadership role?
Germany is not yet used to it, which is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a larger role.
For example, if we look at the euro crisis, then every time Germany takes on a larger role, a wide variety of anti-German feelings become free.
That doesn’t make it easy for Germans.
That’s actually the old problem: you don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It has to be receptive to a wide variety of neighbors and opinions and that’s not easy.
Now the influence of the US in European politics is steadily diminishing, but the EU is not filling this vacuum at the moment, who else remains?
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it's uncomfortable for them and makes them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Brand Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
What is Armani Polo?
Behind it is a completely officially registered name in China, which, however, has nothing to do with the origin companies.
Nevertheless, it enjoys protection as long as the actual namesakes do not complain.
And even then, it is not clear if they are right.
“It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, an attorney at Taylor Wessing, a law firm specializing in intellectual property violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
A few additional letters are enough for the imitators to register their trademarks.
This makes Gucci easy to use Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you can register Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations of the Trademark Office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company had the trademark Zegna DF Puma protected there, an art name that also served at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese are world champions in copying and injuring intellectual property is known.
In the big cities there are multi-storey department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
However, Pattloch’s cases are different: On behalf of his clients, he argues that Chinese companies are officially granted the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", a passenger brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan".
This means women fishing for rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
“This is business-damaging, you have to fight it,” Pattloch said.
"The brand is being watered down, the uniqueness is disappearing, the image damage is enormous."
The financial outages and the process costs of the industries concerned go into the millions, especially in the case of expensive showcase products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third largest market for luxury goods with a volume of 15 billion euros per year and the fastest growing.
However, deletions of dubious entries in the trade mark register are difficult to reach and go into money.
Up to nine years, the procedure can be withdrawn, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports cases in which the court dismissed complaints because after the long duration of the contested name had become "market reality".
If the plaintiff has bad luck, he must even pay the plagiator money because he violated his brand in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese can still use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-and-white logo reminiscent of BMW; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, who let the famous crocodile look the other way.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The trade mark office CTMO in Beijing admits that there were bottlenecks there in 2010 due to insufficient personnel and room equipment.
Last year, however, the "emergency situation in the work process returned to normal".
Thus, the stock of unprocessed opposition proceedings fell by 22 percent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases were completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
However, 81,500 appeals are still pending in office.
Dealing with it costs a lot
As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark protection applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China will be leading the list of new applications around the world for the tenth consecutive time, the agency said.
This also applies to the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan was charged.
This means that each application costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
To tackle it costs a lot, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting against a Chinese plagiator.
The Germans were able to achieve that its illegal manufacture of imitated motor vehicle parts was lifted.
However, the impersonator continued to secure the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
This has been neglected because family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Management Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trade mark office CTMO rejected the Munich opposition.
Freudenberg got it right in the next two instances, but the opponent of the trial continues to fight to this day.
You have to be hellish.
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, “The procedure is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves.”
The internal costs could hardly be quantified, the company archive even had to look through a hundred-year-old file to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposite side in vain a "high six-digit euro amount" for settlement.
“You can see how much this is worth to us,” says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East even threaten to sweep back to Europe.
This is when impersonators secure unprotected trademarks.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business area has long since given up on the Group, yet it was able to avert registration.
“You have to be careful,” says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, rather, foreigners should “register everything that is somehow worth protecting in China,” as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, this can be much more expensive than registering.
In fact, if Freudenberg were to be subject to the last act of his trademark drama, then you would probably have to pay the opposite side royalties for your own name, says Wentzler.
Or we will be pushed out of the market in the segment in question.
World AIDS Day: Stamping, Singing, Helping
In Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi tests - and in Swaziland, Aidswaisen is happy about it.
The history of a connection that spans far more than 8733 kilometers.
First there is the stamping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's pumps and men's slippers are looking for the beat on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Then only the voices of the singers slowly swell - old, bass, tenor and soprano - crowding, beguiling and chasing each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lifts it out of his boots when he brings them together with his smooth, wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir Imbondi is testing a new song.
To the fifty singers have come, between the ages of 23 and 69, from the human geneticist to the housekeeper.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each choral voice has a different text and this one also in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and and parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
Worldwide, there are around 34 million HIV-infected people, which estimates Unaids, the United Nations program to combat AIDS.
23.5 million people live in southern Africa.
There are 245000 AIDS orphans living in Swaziland.
More than 40 percent of the population is HIV positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni, the association Voices for Africa found patrons in Germany.
Seventy of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take on a sponsorship.
They guarantee the child school money, school uniform and a warm meal daily in the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means on Zulu storytellers or also praisers.
The Bantu language fluently speaks in this room no one can, but sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language, bringing them back from time to time to where they originally came from: to the south of Africa.
Because 8,733 kilometers of air line from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
40 percent are infected.
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, much of which are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they have succumbed to the HI virus.
In Esitjeni, it is small that shows what all of Swaziland is sick of: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Circumcisions of the male foreskin, which have been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, are hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus, with the middle thirty dying is no rarity.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but especially the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, who lacked not only parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without schooling, you have no chance in a poor country.
Initially, it was still the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to allow him a warm meal a day.
But just a year later, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa", which has since taken care of the AIDS orphanages in Esitjeni almost professionally.
Facts about Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (gonorrhea).
Common viral STIs are HIV, human papillomaviruses, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Felt lice and scabies belong to the parasitic STI.
Who are the main groups of people affected?
Syphilis and trippers are especially common in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomonades, candidosis (fungus), tripper and human papillomaviruses are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country is comparatively low - nevertheless: about 20 percent of HIV new infections are attributable to this group.
Chlamydia infections are much more common among adolescents than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In this country, human papillomaviruses are also common in adolescents.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to notification.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has more than doubled from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has declined since 2007.
In 2011, there were around 2,700 cases.
That’s about a tenth less than in the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a STD?
The infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, complaints during urination, discharge, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How to protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.
In part, pathogens from sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through lubricating infections and close body contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially with frequently changing sex partners.
Early diagnosed, most STIs can be cured and late consequences avoided.
Through sponsorships, donations and, last but not least, the gags that the choir sings throughout Germany, a lot comes together.
“Overall, we have already sent around 200 000 euros to Esitjeni,” says Annette Lennartz, the chairman of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and assertive woman, manages the funds from Germany.
She also takes care of the orphans well, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as the old women are called on Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them have taken in up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and make sure that the children in their uniforms appear on time for school lessons every day.
If you don’t have any more, you will come to the shelter at Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the club as much as the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has established a sewing school, built two chicken houses, and organized together with the American health organization PSI that many in the village have had an HIV test done.
This is not a matter of course, because no matter how obvious the disease is in the whole country, you prefer to keep it dead.
A king with 14 wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
Actually strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state-sanctioned way of life that the HI virus has spread so rapidly in recent decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
Free condoms would be available at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
The culture is another - flesh to flesh."
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi Choir travels through southern Africa every two or three years, singing songs full of sadness, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, many of which are still familiar with the southern tip of the black continent from the times of apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but has already defied some grim border soldiers a few tears.
The journey always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their godparents.
Although you can hardly find the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni river it is more than known.
“Go to Esitjeni, there is the light,” the people there say.
And if you return the 8733 kilometers of air line to Heidelberg, to the stomping singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e, then you can see it shining there too.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The probe Messenger has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet may be up to 20 meters thick.
The US space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also frozen water there, according to three studies published on Thursday in the journal Science.
The probe Messenger has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the permanently shadowed region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly asteroids that have been struck on Mercury.
No one is related to the discovery of ice but to the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help clarify how water and other building blocks of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed by Earth citizens, probes, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix are exploring the depths of space.
From time to time, they send images to Earth: Small look holes in infinite expanses.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits around the sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" after the new definition of the International Astronomical Union in 2006.
This image of an infrared image of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless star generations: the oldest stars can be identified as blue dots, harder to identify the pink "newborns" in the star circle room.
This star-forming region - called W5 by scientists unromantic - has discovered the telescope Spitzer in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This dazzling glow of a dying star has captured NASA’s Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is made of material that ejected the star in the dying process.
In the giant trifid nebula, 5400 light-years from Earth, new stars emerge from gas and dust.
NASA’s Spitzer telescope shot this photo of the galactic nursery.
The Pleiadian star cluster, also called "The Seven Sisters", can be seen with the naked eye at night.
With the telescope, however, the colors are better appreciated.
Like a red age, the Helix Nebula looks towards the viewer on this infrared photo.
It is located 700 light-years away in the Aquarius constellation.
His similarity to an earthly continent earned this nebula the title of North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo provides spectacular colouring.
This baby star could only be absorbed in its full beauty by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: How they originated is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
Perhaps they are the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without a trace.
One of the largest and sharpest images of the Hubble telescope: The Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the color, recordings of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows the several thousand light-years away trifid nebula in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (threefold, threefold), as dark dust strips divide the glowing heart of the star’s birthplace.
In the constellation of Snakes, astronomers have photographed the harbingers of a cosmic carambolage: 400 million light-years away from the Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies race toward each other and will inevitably collide.
This star birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
If technical abbreviations are not available, they may be called Southern Fire Wheel by their nickname.
The image of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a section from the iris nebula in the constellation of Kepheus.
The fog, which is 1400 light-years away, consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was assembled from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light-years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, recorded the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
The larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
This nebula is home to the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The star meadow always produces new youngsters.
Also, this star cloud, coupled with the rosette nebula, is constantly bringing forth new baby stars - 5000 light-years from Earth.
In this brightly radiating galaxy with a small black hole, no dust exists yet, but only gas.
Researchers suspect that it originated shortly after the Big Bang, when hydrogen was predominantly found in the universe.
Our insights into space: the most important telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 – even before Galileo Galilei used it for stargazing a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have become ever larger – and the insights they provide are ever deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, there is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows glances into the space equally over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone comes at 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
Disadvantage of the favorable design: The telescope is fixed at its angle of elevation - and thus limited in its mobility.
The hobby-eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at a height angle.
Its speciality: the high light collecting power.
In fact, despite the comparatively small mirror diameter, this reaches to that of the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers are listening to alien signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
With the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
This is where the Very Large Telescope stands - which makes its name all credit.
With its total of four mirrors, the telescope can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror is said to cover a whopping 42 meters - and to be composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, images can be expected at the earliest in 2018.
By 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Mauna Kea volcano in Hawaii were considered to be the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors with an average of ten meters each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna-Kea Observatory, which, next to them, still looks into the sky with the Subaru Telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on the Mauna Kea, a new, huge telescope is to be created - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is to be admired on an illustration.
However, the most important impressions from space are provided by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has been delivering images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 planet candidates had been identified since the mission began.
In the picture, the latest preparations for launch are documented at the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched on board an Ariane5 rocket at the earliest in 2018.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to search for light from the first stars and galaxies for the Big Bang.
Scientists assume that there is ice on the southern pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as the messenger runs far closer to the North Pole around the planet.
Radar measurements have indicated for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
With the messenger probe launched in 2004, the first to orbit Mercury, scientists now have certainty.
Drinking butter every day - and getting 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblically old age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A trail search in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblically old age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A trail search in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
The journey through the Talysch Mountains is called wild romantic.
The minibus strolls across the winding road, past densely wooded hills, rippling rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you're in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of the Talys, of which not much is known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as Aserian and is very durable.
The end station is Lerik.
The small town boasts of too massive architecture from Soviet times, which does not want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, too difficult is the arrival of Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometers it takes eight hours because the road is only one lane.
The fabulous wealth that the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the stuff of tourist attraction.
“Baku became famous with the Eurovision Song Festival in May – and next year we will have a festival of the oldest people in the world,” Fatulayeva says.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here the vita of about eight dozen talyschen from the area is documented, which is older than 100. Fatulayeva points to a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, a child was born.
But the controversial star of the museum is the sheep herder <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov, who is said to have turned 168 years old.
There is no birth certificate.
And given the oldest documented person, who turned 122 years old, Müslümov’s age seems extremely doubtful.
"In 1805 he was born here in the region, in 1973 he died," Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 he is said to have had another daughter.
So has <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov been counting down by a few decades at his age?
But Rembrandt Scholz, a senior researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the high-ranking people in Central Asia.
“Obviously many high-aged people also exist in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” says Scholz, “even in Sardinia, there are extremely many very old men living.”
Due to the lack of documents, however, no scientific evidence about the age should be provided, especially since passenger registers were missing.
Melted butter every day
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik are remarkably often reaching a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years old.
So why do so many people live here in the South?
The Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talys.
Museum director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it is nutrition.
However, the fact that the high-calorie diet of talyschen is supposed to be so healthy that people love meat, bread and especially dairy products, and many of them drink a glass of melted butter daily, does not seem plausible from a nutritional point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the town of Lerik, Rubaba lives Mirzayeva.
At the age of 97 she is still comparatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butter barrel, which she untiringly rolls back and forth.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and a daughter, both of whom have long been grandparents.
Two small children also jump around.
Guests can prepare tea in the kitchen, which is served in the typical, belly-shaped Armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva’s white teeth are perfectly in line, under her headscarf she hides long, dark-blonde braids that her son proudly reveals in front of us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out of my way and kept their color.
“I never used shampoo,” says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough to live
She always only ate what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
My whole life I didn’t buy food at the supermarket once.
Then she tells about her husband who was in the army.
It was the worst in the post-World War II period.
But everything got better when the "loved father" Heydar Aliyew took the helm.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult, which is driven around the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, knows hardly any borders in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003 he was in power, and later his son Ilham took over the helm.
After all, there is no need among Azerbaijan’s ancients.
230 manat (about the same sum in euros), Mirzayeva receives monthly as a pension, for local conditions an amount of which one can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayeva’s long-buried son is right: “The old people enjoy respect in our culture.”
They live in the middle of the extended family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If this is not a reason to stay alive for as long as possible
The word "human rights" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival rallies in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country.
The future constitution with Sharia as the basis is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president did not spare with pathos.
We have to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds is my responsibility, in front of the people and in front of God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the entire people, but above all to the Christian Copts, the Liberals, enlightened Muslims and seculars.
For all of them, hitherto hopelessly dissected in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a God-state on the Nile from the graces of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He has, said Mohammed Mursi, almost apologetically, temporarily curtailed the constitutional court's powers and expanded his powers to "save the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, is that the Egyptians themselves, the world is not quite clear.
Should the Judiciary be removed?
In fact, the 234 articles that have been scoured by the Islamist-dominated 100-member Constituent Assembly in a nightly, 15-hour parforce ride are partly alarming.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also states that the case law is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does “principles” mean?
That was and is a matter of interpretation, and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the fuzzy formulation and the associated legal scope for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
This suggests at least one newly added article: In all matters concerning Sharia, Al-Ashar University must be consulted, the country’s most important Islamic institution with great ray power throughout Sunni Islam.
That doesn’t have to be, but it can mean that the clergy oversee the legislation, which would de facto result in the dismissal of the judiciary.
Much of the draft draft is a matter of interpretation.
Also problematic: civil military jurisdiction should continue to be maintained.
These courts served during Mubarak's rule to suppress oppositionists.
After the overthrow of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
The state should also, according to the draft, "protect the true nature of the Egyptian family" and promote its morality and values.
This is legally so vaguely formulated that state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature with the help of this article.
In plain text, this means nothing but censorship.
No article, by the way, explicitly states the equality of men and women.
For this, someone else forbids insulting or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his Messengers.
But what is an insult and how it should be punished remains unclear.
Similarly, dubios suggests the wording that the "injury of people" is forbidden.
Is there a cartoon of the president or a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
It is a matter of interpretation, as so much in the draft, which Morsi has to sign and, in his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians for the referendum.
“The revolution has returned.”
The opposition has been forming for weeks against the supremacy of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in unprecedented unity on Friday evening at Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to bring down the Charter even before it could enter into force.
“The revolution has returned and we will win,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-placer of the presidential elections.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El-Baradei said the draft constitution belonged "to the rubbish mountain of history".
Through short news service Twitter, he accused the supporters of Mursis of wanting to lead a "putsch against democracy".
“If he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him,” said opposition leader Jasser Said.
“We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet atoned for,” the Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali as saying.
And several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, making it invalid.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, for its part, blew for the demonstration, but cautiously not on Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
Many veiled women and followers of the Salafists took part in it, shouting, "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded of Morsi, "Cleanse the land!" and affirmed, "The Qur'an is our constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would have raised civil war-like conditions.
Obviously, Mursi’s supporters did not want to risk it.
The Muslim brothers stated that both the opponents of the draft constitution and the supporters had expressed themselves loudly and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box decide in which direction the country should go.
A majority for the draft of the Islamists is considered safe.
“The word human rights doesn’t even occur.”
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which should have gone until February and involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their worldview, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, convicted, imprisoned.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution," he laments in conversation with the "world on Sunday".
Morsi's expansion of power to all three powers in the state had the lawyer resign.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, the president is de facto putting it out of power,” Saeda laments.
But without civil society organizations, a democracy cannot work.
Saeda feels left alone, even by the international community, which considers the ideological struggle for direction on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be revenge.
A protester on the Tahrir warns, "You're carrying a monster that you can't control anymore."
Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the most smelly fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living – not only in Europe, but around the world.
Could the country’s secret of success have anything to do with the local appetite for rather foul-smelling fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a bunch of dirty, damp sportswear.
And leave her there for a week.
This is about the nose numbing smell of Rakfisk, one of Norway’s great delicacies.
I am located in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow here, spectacular landscapes - and this stubborn smell in the air that just doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfisk is a salt-strewn trout that is fermented in water for up to a year, depending on how stinky you would like your fish.
When the darkness comes over the country in Norway and the weather gets colder, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes, which is dedicated to this, well, really very captivating specialty.
"You eat it raw and then rinse it down with a glass of Aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire station, but also hosts the festival as a so-called "rakfisk general".
People around us eat small fish cubes and consume large amounts of alcohol.
“Some people like the Aquavit more than the Rakfisk,” Havard says.
The spirit can displace the smell.
I'll take a few bites.
If you avoid getting the Rakfisk near your nose, it’s not bad – like sushi, which has a pretty long bus ride behind it.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling options and fish was soaked in airtight salt water barrels in autumn.
In the deepest winter he was then taken out after a long fermentation and - undoubtedly with the help of alcohol dampened senses - consumed.
A generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and mainly emigrated to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly – more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labor market, high wages and a comprehensive healthcare system.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who was far richer than Norway not so long ago, immigrants flock.
Rakfisk is considered to be something important - an essential, albeit strictly smelling part of Norwegian history.
It is one of the most expensive dishes you can buy here.
But actually everything here is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proudly 10 euros.
Norway doesn’t often make it into the world press, and most people don’t seem to mind that.
Here you still hate to call Anders Breivik by name - those racist right-wing extremists who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, it refers only to the "July 22 incident".
Norwegians are struggling to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal killings.
The main responsibility for Norway’s present wealth has been the growth of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world since the early 1970s.
“But oil isn’t the only reason we’re doing so well,” says Anna, our waitress, who distributes the round trays with mature rakfisk and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blonde hair and piercing blue eyes.
We are, as they say, a prudent people.
Your English is just like most people here immaculately.
We're not very vociferous, we don't like bragging.
Norway has handled its oil wealth very carefully – a large part of the industry’s revenues are invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When, in the years leading up to the global economic crisis, everyone threw around with money that they didn’t have, Norway kept its wallet tightly closed.
“As long as we can ski in winter and go hiking in summer, we are happy,” says Anna.
"And of course eat rakfisk," she adds with careless laughter.
I stand in the snow and prepare for another dish - from Rakfisk I have enough.
Such an elk-citizen is definitely something else. The juicy meat is my mouth.
But in the evening the Stinkfish is again on the menu.
The hotel where I stay is one of several venues that organize a Rakfisk dinner where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenging - fish.
There is a live TV circuit to a fly-clad showmaster surrounded by plates with rakfisk.
The show is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here's our points, Havard".
You clap and laugh.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by the aquavit.
But maybe it's the strict haze of the whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces tough start
As Mexico’s future President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares for his inauguration, Will Grant from the BBC analyses the challenges ahead and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, traffic in Mexico City is particularly poor.
Even on better days, this is an always clogged city, but on Monday a ring of steel was built, which locks off several important traffic routes to the capital and causes chaos on the streets.
However, the goal was not to disturb commuters on their way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico’s new President Enrique Pena Nieto will take over the leadership of the nation.
He is facing a complex task.
Under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderons, Mexico has been able to prove itself economically, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already cost 60,000 lives in the last six years.
“My government is strongly committed to reducing the violence,” Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy with which we can achieve this goal.
Before joining the U.S. President, Pena Nieto served as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, sprawling part of the country that surrounds the capital, opinions about the new head of state are shared.
A direct man
In the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, for example, you like to remember him.
Residents of the resort attribute to him the development of tourism and the construction of the infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on one of the highways that Pena Nieto had built and which represent a great improvement over the fragile, bumpy streets that once existed here.
Plaques with its name also hang outside a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect real and lasting changes from him," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a congressman for the Pena Nietos party, the PRI.
In particular, as regards security and the economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country urgently needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the Los Pinos presidential palace, the party has high expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
The accusations of the opposition, the new president lack substance, he rejects.
He is a very direct man, very committed and has big plans for the country.
He is an excellent statesman, but above all he is someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share this view about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under highway crossings and in many ways represents a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of a crucial urban nature.
Earlier this year, the military was turned on to fight the drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
The bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left on a patch of Brachland near a large landfill in the last two years alone.
During the tenure of Governor Pena Nieto, over 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico – a statistic that surpasses even that of the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and the murders of innocent women.
Critics Pena Nietos believe that he has at least not adequately addressed the problem of women's murders during his term of office.
But in the worst case, his government closed its eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the run down neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles with her tears as she shows me photos of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes she was murdered by her life partner.
“When I arrived at her home, it seemed like her body had been washed,” recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body star had already used.
As her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall and is placed next to a cross with one word: justice.
But this, according to the family, has been denied to her so far.
The authorities treated me as if I were a talker, a troublemaker, a nuggler.
They want you to simply accept their judgment and keep your mouth shut.
“But that’s not possible if there were so many form errors and omissions,” she says.
When President Pena Nieto receives the presidency on Saturday, he also assumes a great deal of responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been affected by violent crimes over the past six years, and the new president has promised to take special care of this problem during his term in office.
“I hope he is as president as he was as governor,” said Prime Minister Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of this.
The Prosecutor's Office claims Bradley Manning has not complained about abuse
The prosecutor's office contradicts Bradley Manning's allegations that he has been mistreated in prison
The hearing deals with Manning's time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defense seeks to dismiss the charge due to harsh conditions of detention
The liberator of the U.S. Army is accused of squandering thousands of confidential documents
The prosecutor's office on Friday tried to determine that the army-free Bradley Manning - accused of the largest disclosure of confidential information in U.S. history - missed several opportunities to complain about the alleged abuse he suffered in military custody.
At a cross-examination Mannings during a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein stated that documents on weekly visits made by prison officials during Manning's nine-month detention in Quantico, Virginia, had no complaints about his treatment.
A day before the cross-examination, which was held as a result of a request by the defense to reject the charge - Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the hard jail time - Manning had stated that he had considered suicide in prison.
The U.S. Army intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his time in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as a source of information.
In the hearing on Friday, Fein and Manning went through the forms that officials had filled out after their meeting with Manning during his detention at Quantico Military Prison, where he had been incarcerated from July 2010 to April 2011 under increased conditions of detention.
The officers asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
When Fein asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had assessed the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the establishment as "very professional" overall.
The forms, according to Fein, contained no complaints about abuse, although officials had asked Manning directly about his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally and the officials had discussed them with him and indicated that they were dealing with them, but they had not been recorded.
“They wrote down (after discussing the concerns) ‘No problems’, and that didn’t necessarily mean I didn’t say anything at all,” Manning said.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to examine the suicidal thoughts he mentioned on a form a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to have his observation status downgraded to “prevention of injuries.”
The military said it had assigned him this restrictive status — which is one stage under the threat of suicide — to his and to the protection of others.
“I wanted to convince employees that I was doing well and get rid of the observational status to prevent injuries (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life in my opinion,” Manning said.
Manning said on Thursday about his arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the prison of Quantico Naval Base in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and had become unconscious due to the heat.
Not knowing what was going on with him or in the outside world was burdensome.
“My world shrunk on Camp Arafjon, on this cage together,” Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in this cage.
When he was moved to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell — at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours — and without society.
He was only allowed a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to stay in motion because the day was forbidden to sleep or just lie down.
He always had to sleep with light that penetrated into his cell from the outside.
When he turned around at night and guards couldn’t see his face anymore, they woke him up so that he turned back.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally objected to Manning's treatment.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the military prison of Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, Judge Manning also questioned an accusation he had raised in his statement on Thursday – so he had to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico one night and stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners at a morning count.
Manning had stated that he had never had the opportunity to envelop himself with his blanket during this count.
At Friday's interview, Manning stated that he had shut down a command from his guard to drop the blanket he could have covered, but admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning said he was forced to sleep naked the previous night, trying to show an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning told the officer that he could have used the waistband of his underpants or flip-flops to hurt himself, but he did not.
That night, Manning said, his underpants, flip-flops and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his detention experiences and drastically reduce his detention rate should he be convicted in his trial before the military court, which is scheduled for early next year.
The defense has stated that Manning will plead guilty to lesser offenses, while other charges, which are considered too extreme, are to be challenged.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend, and the prosecutor’s office is expected to justify the terms of detention.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning was detained in accordance with the provisions that apply to all prisoners detained in Quantico under the highest security measures.
The charges against Manning include favoring the enemy, unlawful disclosure of intelligence information on the Internet, the transmission of national defense information and the theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty in all charges, he faces a life sentence.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame the emigrants – they call on them to remember difficult times, he says.
Navarrette believes Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at passport control when inconsistency spread within me.
Signs referred to two queues: one for "Mexicans" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, unsure of which one to go to.
I grew up in central California and was called "Mexicans" all my life.
An ethnic shortcoming - just like my friends in Boston call themselves "Iren" or my friends in New York "Italians".
Later, I decided to call myself "Mexican-American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather’s home, there was no need for shortcuts or hyphens.
I was just American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to assert myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don’t have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I won’t let go of my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and put myself in line for Extranjeros.
I was thinking about that moment this week when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
The agenda included all the issues that are expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one reason why Mexicans today are equally likely to stay in Mexico rather than emigrate to the United States.
He wants to unite with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc modelled on the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue the war in Mexico against the drug cartels, even though he did not mention any details in this regard.
Mexico’s relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848 and forced the country's leadership under a rifle to leave them more than half of their territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event are not to be missed.
So once a U.S. government official has even the mildest criticism of Mexico, complaints are heard in the Mexican press and among the country’s elites about how Americans are oppressing the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the children of Montezumas go on the path of war.
And yet, Mexico’s biggest challenge is in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Want to talk about resentments?
There is more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason so many people of Mexican origin live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree, a person — perhaps a parent or grandparent — got no chance in Mexico and emigrated to the north.
And in most cases, this person corresponded to a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty is to them.
Not Mexico.
And while we may have lived the American dream, attended good schools, and got good jobs, we must never lose sight of the American dream that we live - not the Mexican one.
Our identity may sometimes be blurred, but as far as our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
Moreover, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership do not like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a memorial to a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families had not failed in Mexico, they would not have left.
And then we wouldn't be trapped behind the silk curtain - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are – and Mexican Americans are taking this awry to them.
While she is a U.S. citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know have the feeling that they don’t belong to either one country or the other.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
One enjoys the best of both worlds, but is not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the education bourgeoisie want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as provisional "ambassadors" for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and put pressure on the political leadership to intensify their ties with Mexico.
Well.
That won't happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And given the unequal distribution of income, unbridled corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure if it is really a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through it alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico one and a half centuries ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge about how their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "mexican" than I thought.
Old Battles, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected pillar of peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to suffocate such a hope in the germ.
In the midst of the usual indebtedness, countless buildings were laid in rubble and ashes, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis killed - and for the first time, rockets from Gaza near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem have been struck.
But although Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historical conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of these turmoils.
Maybe this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly stalemate situation could finally come to an end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism seems anything but appropriate in view of the current situation.
Even if the cease-fire agreed on 21 November, this week’s fighting has strengthened the hard-fought on both sides.
Hamas’s leaders, the Islamist movement that has been controlling the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed back the Israelis, despite the fact that its group itself had to face heavy losses.
Although several Hamas leaders have been killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are incarcerated in one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has not yet succeeded in destroying Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that they have time on their side.
Just as Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to attract powerful and rich friends to its side.
Turkey, a resurgent regional power once considered Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has seized for the Hamas party – just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Hailing Hamas supporters believe that an Islamist crescent is forming around Israel – from Lebanon in the north, where militant Hezbollah has the power to cross Syria, where rebels could face an increasingly Islamist imprint on Bashar Assad’s overthrow, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And in particular the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - the most populous and important Arab country by far - on the southern flank of Israel has changed the region's balance sustainably.
Hosni Mubarak, the Laizist despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the Brotherhood is veiled with Hamas and its leaders are more dependent on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor who cannot be pushed out even by Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, draw an opposite conclusion.
From a military standpoint, Hamas is no longer a threat.
The Israeli missile defense system, Iron Dome, has proved itself and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep more peacefully.
From a diplomatic point of view, the United States remains steadfast in its position, and many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest escalations of violence.
Israel has done well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers, not least thanks to the lockdowns that extend into the West Bank and thus into the main part of any Palestinian state, protecting the Jewish settlements, which have been declared illegal under international law, but are still being expanded.
Netanyahu is in good hands, and his Likud party has joined an even more militant group in the run-up to the January 22 elections under Avigdor Lieberman.
Why do these insidious Palestinians also embarrass and leave them a state of their own?
If they were in fact in control of the West Bank, wouldn’t they fire rockets just like their counterparts in the Gaza Strip?
No, it is better to keep them in check behind the wall and punish them if they dare to raise their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to assert themselves, but the Arab Spring could make them a dash through the bill.
Even if the Islamists, now in power in Egypt and in other countries, have little left for Israel, they will initially focus on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel’s defense seat is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to repair their economy.
The fact that the pragmatic President Mursi met with Barack Obama to reach a ceasefire could be a promising sign – and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think more long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking timid steps towards democratization, Palestinians continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination – a powder barrel that will undoubtedly one day explode in the Israeli-occupied areas, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Suppression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population this situation will only intensify.
Bloody missions to repress Hamas in the Gaza Strip will increasingly demand their diplomatic tribute over the years.
Both sides need a push from the outside
The correct answer is that represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world, and by this newspaper: two states in which Israel cedes territories for security purposes.
The hope - small for the near future - is that the ceasefire will give outsiders more influence to enforce this solution.
Egypt, along with Turkey and Qatar, must now stop arms shipments to the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by land swaps and a common Jerusalem.
Foreign Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
This would be done more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the upcoming request for UN observer status.
Obama, too, must help move Israel to negotiations.
During his first term in office, he missed the idea of his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems as if he was equally averse to participation.
But this is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a major interest in a stable Middle East.
And that includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian law on uniform cigarette packaging comes into force
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs that are the same for all tobacco brands
The world’s first laws for uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging have come into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colors with neutral, olive-green lids, which are also printed with drastic images showing sick body parts and babies and children suffering from cigarette smoke.
Apart from the different health warnings and pictures, the only difference between the packages in the brand names, which are printed in identical, small print, is from next Saturday.
Australia has introduced the world’s most stringent tobacco packaging regulations.
The Australian government wants to stop young people from smoking by eliminating the glamorous image of tobacco consumption.
The government is assuming that studies that have shown that people who have not started smoking at 26 are not likely to start smoking afterwards, with a 99% chance.
"You can already see in children of young age that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to promote with their brand image," said Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek, quoting studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will only have a minor impact on the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
It said that the laws would favour black market trading, leading to cheaper and more easily accessible cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences," said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far larger quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, notes that the demand for cigarette cases and silicone lids to cover the intolerable packaging has risen enormously since the companies British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco failed two months ago at the Supreme Australian Court with their challenge to the laws.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units in wholesale stores and is waiting for new stocks.
For us, this is a good business.
According to experts, the catch in the popularity of social media lies with exactly the population group to which the plan is aimed.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from TV advertising, banned them from acting as sports sponsors, and forced most retailers to stop putting cigarettes out in stores, and now tobacco advertising has been switched to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
“Anyone who markets tobacco and has only a small area left to promote their products doesn’t get around the Internet,” says Becky Freeman, a researcher in healthcare at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook, Freeman has seen an increase in reviews of brands written by “normal people.”
You have to ask yourself: Is this just a private person who likes Marlboro cigarettes so much that they even record a video for it – or does a marketing agency have to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says the industry instead of marketing focuses on dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new regulations – those countries complain to the World Trade Organization about unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries engage in major trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected for mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to issue photographic warnings in 2001.
These have now been expanded to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are defiant.
The pictures do not affect me.
I just ignore them.
“You just take a tip and put the box away,” says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box where a photo is printed with a mouth tumor.
Honestly, there's only one reason I'd stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in downtown Sydney, says the uniform packaging has made filling his shelves more difficult.
“I used to take an hour to sort a delivery, now I need four,” Yu says.
"The government should have simply banned cigarettes completely - then we would have said okay, that's it, we're closing down," he added visibly infuriated.
In a constantly electrified world, it’s nice to be bored sometimes
This Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane fell out due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to make a few thoughts boring.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting half a day at the airport for a flight is pretty annoying – even when books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts are leading boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it’s okay for us – and our children – to be bored occasionally.
This forces the brain to lose itself in interesting thought processes, which may promote creativity.
And because most of us today are almost constantly staring at one or the other screen, the benefits of boredom no longer benefit us.
So should we welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yeah, yeah.
And no.
I'll come back to that again.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011), doesn't see that.
"In fact, boredom has a very long history," he says.
The house walls of Pompeii adorn a Latin graffiti about boredom dating back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York, Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After long reading of research literature and presenting the idea to a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom can be defined as the experience of " wanting to do a satisfying job but not being able to do it".
As a result, boredom differs from apathy in that the person is not busy, but wants to be.
In apathy, however, there is no urge to do anything.
The key experience of boredom, he says, consists in a “disruption of the attention process, coupled with a bad mood and the feeling that time is only passing slowly.”
This can make boredom sound almost like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes, although these two conditions may be related, bored people see the problem in their surroundings or in the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we’re boring, even when we’re just having trouble concentrating.
In her study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - in German for example: "The Inactive Mind: The Definition of boredom under the aspect of attention", which appeared in September in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science", Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a volume in front of a magazine.
Some groups heard a loud TV program from the neighboring room that had nothing to do with the content, others listened to it at low volume, so it was barely noticeable, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
The people who heard the barely audible television said they felt more boredom than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, could find no reason for it and attributed their difficulties to boredom.
If you’re trying to focus on a difficult or strenuous task, disruption of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study’s authors.
If, on the other hand, you perform a monotonous activity - "just like the search for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help you not feel bored".
In fact, he says, we now know that hemmings and crayons, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can even fight them by keeping people more physically alert.
“Studies have shown that children who are allowed to hug around learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still,” said Fenske.
We all get bored at some point - my late flight, a roaring speaker, a particularly tiring film.
But some people get bored more easily than others.
To measure these differences, researchers developed a "scale of boredom susceptibility" in the 1980s.
On the scale there are statements such as "Many things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything".
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys are more often bored than girls, according to Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida – especially in terms of the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are a rather tense bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32% of the adults at school and doing homework were bored, while 23% said they were bored when they weren’t in school.
But only 3% of parents said they felt bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he does not know if the percentages of boredom have increased or decreased.
However, he is certain that “youth is considered particularly boring,” mainly because children and teenagers have no major influence on their daily lives.
So back to my original question: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, it causes people to take extreme physical risks and gamble or drugs to relieve them – studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity, which is Professor Vodanovich’s opinion, who has been researching the subject for more than two decades.
“With boredom, the brain wants to tell you that you should do something else,” said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn’t always know what to do best.
If you’re bored and you use that energy to play guitar and cook, you’ll be happy.
Television, however, can cause feelings of happiness in the short term, but they will evaporate again in the long term.
So, if you give your bored child an iPad, you can take it away from boredom, but it has not learned to entertain or control yourself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds, “Self-control transfers from one situation to another.”
The child not only learns to talk, but also gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
Nor should we see them too critical.
Instead, our goal should be to feel comfortable away from constant activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we should be bored more often, but boredom is the tormenting, incessant desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that people are really just looking for a way to turn off and relax.
"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated, it's hard to get busy once the noise is muted."
In Colorado, there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
A 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco stands trial in southeastern Colorado for a crime that will soon be legal in this state: possession of a few fewer marijuana chunks and a pipe with which he smoked them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were driving a car in Lamar near the Kansas border on a September day when they were stopped.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was charged with possession of drugs and drug equipment — cavalry crimes, each with a $100 penalty — and received a court date.
"We are treated like criminals," Orozco said.
But is he also one?
In the uncertain weeks following the state’s decision to legalize small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of smaller drug offences depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of misdemeanors surrounding marijuana are already being dropped here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
Police authorities are no longer tracking adults over the age of 21 for possession to a small extent, which is permitted by law as soon as the new laws come into force in the next few weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado’s more conservative districts have announced that they will continue to pursue existing marijuana crimes and are still citing people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains, agree to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana businesses from opening in their communities.
“This situation is evolving so fast that I don’t know what’s going to happen next,” said Daniel J. Oates, Aurora Police Chief, located east of Denver.
And regulators in the state of Washington are also scratching their heads.
They are waiting for guidance on setting up a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug – and have a deadline until 1 December 2013.
In Washington, Colorado is believed to be ahead of most states in the regulation of marijuana, where the drug was legalized for medical purposes and self-consumption.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, so the state is well-suited for orientation,” said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State’s liquor regulator.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
“We don’t have a real precedent that we can follow,” he adds.
The Washington law, called I-502, comes into force on December 6, making it the end point of a grey area in which the state licensing system does not yet exist, but the possession is legalized.
And uncomfortable practical issues need to be clarified at this time – for example, how the state’s provision of “appropriate access” to licensed marijuana is to be agreed upon with the banning of cannabis businesses around 300 meters around schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
“Nowhere will it be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently formed research group.
On November 21, Chief Oates sent an email to his Aurora staff stating that the prosecutor would no longer prosecute minor marijuana offenses in people over the age of 21, and that the police would "from now on" not seek criminal charges for these offenses.
Chief Oates added that the police will continue to enforce urban regulations regulating growers of medical marijuana and drug traffickers will continue to be prosecuted.
In Weld County in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck has a stricter view.
After the vote, he stated that his authority would continue to track cases of marijuana possession, mainly to move consumers to withdraw.
Currently, 119 people have to answer for possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana in court, although many have also been charged with other crimes.
“Our authority has a duty to prosecute violations involving crimes at the time of the crime,” Buck said in a statement.
The reactions are ambiguous even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county’s largest city, no longer show adults for possession of smaller quantities.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop all outstanding property proceedings.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time enforcing the right until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the conflicting reactions throughout the state encouraged a profound split among local officials in view of the great green experiment.
District attorneys are a “cultural barrier,” says Sean McAllister, a Denver attorney who represents marijuana victims in court and acts locally as a spokesman for the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws.
“They have spent such a large part of their lives pursuing individuals for criminal prosecution that they still cannot accept legalization,” he believes.
As the first states to treat smaller amounts of marijuana such as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are treated as national sample cases for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials are preparing for an age of legal sales, they are also waiting nervously for instructions from the federal government, which wants to continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level as a crime.
Advocates of the legalization movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will yield.
Despite several sensational arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the federal government has largely allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, former Obama administration drug policy adviser, believes that while law enforcement officials are unlikely to enter doors to seize smaller amounts of drugs, they are likely to be robbing themselves of legal, state-regulated marijuana business under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not even waiting for the federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local municipal administrations approved moratoriums for new marijuana businesses, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the west, decided on a six-month ban, which is likely to be passed next week.
“We don’t want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a big problem at the federal level,” said Bob Nicholson, member of the city council.
Our community voted against this change of law.
We are guided by what the community has chosen, not by what the state has chosen.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford because I'm Tory
Not only university students of today are being attacked for their views
It has always been my dream to have a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had attended that university, which I once considered to be the world’s greatest temple of knowledge, for a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization – free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks of entering Worscester College at the end of the eighties – where I had planned to study history – I had packed my suitcases again and thus brought about the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard it was said that I would have gone because I had a problem with fellow students having sex in the neighboring room.
Author A N Wilson said that I had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran, because I suffered from systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
I was harassed for one reason only - a reason that seemed so narrower and crueler in this supposed cradle of enlightenment: my now deceased father Woodrow Wyatt had been an important adviser to Margaret Thatchers and I advocated the Conservative Party.
Why am I mentioning this right now?
Well, according to current reports, a new generation of students of moderate rights suffers from similar persecution.
The organized and rising hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week called for equal rights protection that benefits gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College’s Junior Common Room (JCR) say they are “often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable” due to their political views.
They demand a seat on their college’s equality committee to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed.
Her situation was exacerbated by a recent documentary about political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which Tories portrayed as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
Among other things, this was shown by graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University’s conservative student association, who rode in a Rolls-Royce and wore a silver suit and silver-studded walking stick.
At other universities, conservative students say they are considered “beneficial for introducing higher tuition fees.”
Luke Black, 20-year-old vice president of the University of Nottingham’s conservative student association, said in a Sunday newspaper: “There is a growing left-wing tendency at universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even getting to know each other."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and a history student in Corpus Christi who initiated the application for greater protection, believes such a climate is "unpleasant". 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, designated president of Oxford's conservative student association, says she has observed a growing rejection of students of moderate rights among JCR members.
“This poses a danger to intellectual discourse and to the well-being of members,” she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred for the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
Last year, the university had voted not to award Margaret Thatcher – a former student – an honorary degree due to cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would have even frightened Stalinists.
In the first days of the first semester week, when new students get to know each other and the tutors, I got a taste of the future events.
I had the experience that the tutors not only tolerated the mocking of Tory students, but even participated with pleasure.
Political issues such as the miners’ strike, the privatization and the rejection of the government of sanctions against South Africa’s apartheid regime found their way into the wooden rooms of the Tutorium.
At my first of these events, I was supposed to translate French texts from the 18th century into English, and I wasn’t prepared for what was to come.
"Miss Wyatt," said tutor Harry Pitt, "please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled into it.
Pitt was a little man with a face like a cake dough, and pretty ugly.
"Do Thatcher supporters refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students chirped.
There were tears in my eyes.
"I suggest they take a few French lessons in their spare time - so if you're not too busy with your social activities," Pitt murmured.
I returned to my room with a hanging head.
That night, I was sitting in college alone at dinner, when someone slightly tipped me on my shoulder.
It was a second-year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the conservative student association.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it is what it is.
Anyone suspected of being Tory is being harassed.
It's already bad enough for me, but they know that your father Margaret Thatcher is close, so it'll be worse for you.
Most Tory first semesters pretend to be supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I later tried to change my mind.
I insisted that I did not agree with Mrs. Thatcher on all points.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A beginner in philosophy, politics and economics, who had ironically attended Eton College, a conservative, said to me, “You are the daughter of a fascist pig.”
You're dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverted and dirty.
"How do Tories have sex?" one asked.
They beat each other, don't they?
I felt like homosexuals must have felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever succeed in living a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years before me extended before my spiritual eye to a purgatory of awe and isolation.
The only tutor who openly recognized himself as Tory was Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history, who had his seat in my college.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also for advising Thatcher on foreign policy and writing speeches for them.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincial and small-minded, and rejected it for his Marxist-Determinist perspective on history.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started commuting between Oxford and my parents’ house and found refuge with more open-minded friends and family members in the city.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why I did it.
He seemed incredulous.
During his time in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
“But it’s the best place in the world,” he said.
They would never do such a thing, not in my city of dreamy tower peaks.
Even my communist friends always showed perfect manners.
His wet eyes were dimmed.
Give it a chance.
I'm sure they're just teasing you.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance became weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, had given up on the pressure and renounced his beliefs.
During a tutorial the following week, in which another history tutor had seriously claimed that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Even though I was secretly torn from shame, I admitted that my parents had subjected me to a "brainwashing" and called them "old sluts."
The relief lasted only a short time.
It was my father who hit the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At the time, he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was closed.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes my asses gave up.
When they left, I grabbed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You can call me a crying swallow.
But no 18-year-old should ever have to suffer such intimidation and malice in an educational institution.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford – a university that not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but still hides behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to celebrity"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture", which opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion maker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This has been acknowledged by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a grand retrospective for which more than 130 dresses of the Haute Couture have been put together, created by his "Maison" over the past 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story, the only protagonist of which is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clientele.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the nimble and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, which will be on display until March 3rd, there are a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the finest aristocracy, from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan, to the Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise from the modest fashion maker in the town of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jetset.
Being in love with the nobility does not have to be a disadvantage.
"At least they don't kick their dicks out on your magnificent carpet, as some beautiful celebrities from pop music do," says Baronin Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all delighted when we were invited to his home in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, close friends with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of fame.
And yet he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
Even the Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the fashion maker.
Many years ago we went home for dinner after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Every detail of his apartment, the decoration, the food and the music recognized and felt his influence.
“All invited felt important and loved,” recalls the “top model” that began her career at the week of Haute Couture 1995 in Paris.
"He never comes out of fashion because his designs are works of art," she concludes.
Fashion show of origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of indulgence, rather of mutual affections.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious and 60-meter-long runway, which includes a roller exchange: the user takes the place of the model and walks along the runway to admire a dreamy "audience" wearing the masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chooses for her wedding with Arist<0xC3><0xB3>teles Onassis "Viassie".
In this crowd of fashion dolls shine names such as that of Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Fashionmaker, 2006
Many of these customers say the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I can still remember perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a vest type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection 1971-1972.
“It was a gift from him,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer’s muse.
“I prefer him to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he highlights our beauty,” adds Feria’s ex-Herzogine.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Also the princess and opinion leader at the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can not forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed of finally having the age and opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
At the end of the 1990s, it finally happened.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying skirt and a draped top with a décolleté that honors his name.
“It was a dream come true,” says Rodrigo d’Arenberg’s widow.
“Valentino doesn’t depend on fashion, his obsession is timeless,” explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening dresses of the fashion maker "with absolute care" because "a dress is not only a dress, but also the associated memories".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller’s wedding dress for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "ragazzos" (as the fashion maker called his seamstresses) were necessary to make this ivory silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroidery and a four-and-a-half-meter-long tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the top authority of the trade press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the top society".
For years with the elite's "savoir-<0xC3><0xAA>tre", Valentino is now their best specimen.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (Italy’s highest award), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the Legion of Honor, sums up Garavani as much honor as any of his clients’ husbands.
"I have always noticed his refinement, his peace, his well-groomed and perfect exterior," D'Arenberg admits.
I saw him last month at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He sat at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was immaculate; time leaves no trace of him".
And this is what a princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human working animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the Indonesian volcano’s carriers risk their lives and health when they carry 70 kilos of sulfur over the steep, rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by getting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, he must climb down to the bottom of his crater every day, where the sulfur-containing gas flowing out of the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulfur stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilos in total, he transports them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the sloping paths made of stone.
Although it is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to an altitude of 2386 meters, the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes to rise at turtle speed, keeping the balance and taking their steps carefully so that they do not slip and fall.
They know that every step can cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed years ago on the slopes of Kawah Ijen.
The Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 Eurocents for every kilo of sulfur they mine.
When they arrive at the top, they make their way between the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and walk with the tiringly heavy baskets three kilometers to the scale, which a mining company has set up a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, who has been exploiting the volcanic deposits since 1960 and (never better said) its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocents) for every kilo of sulfur.
This is then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocents) each to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for bleaching sugar.
“Since we usually carry 70 kg, we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each route,” explains Anto, who usually makes three routes a day.
For each route it takes three hours, after which it is completely finished, but at the end of the day it has 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) together.
What looks like a meserable reward for such an almost inhuman effort, however, is the triple of what he would earn with field work.
“The daily wage of the miners here, where 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) are paid per day at the coffee harvest and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros), is very high,” explains the bearer, who previously worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not that hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a nearby village, for a reason as important as the sulfur in Indonesia: "I married a girl from Bali where they are Hindus, and I brought her to Java to convert her to Islam".
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases.
For three years, 27-year-old Anto has been risking his life at Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already left his first traces, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
“I’m going to work here for two more years because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French,” he promises in a more than acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent but life-punished young man could work as a tourist guide, waiter or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a carrier.
It splits a dirty wooden hut with other supports and stands up every morning at two o’clock because the sulfur also flows out at night, where its characteristic yellow color shines in the dark bluish.
Challenging the shadows, he climbs into the crater in the light of a small headlamp on his helmet, which he bought himself from his own money.
About 400 carriers load the baskets with sulfur on their shoulders on the crater floor.
Despite its large profits, the mining company has not mechanized the reduction of sulphur to save costs, and does not supply any equipment to the carriers who work on their own account and are paid for weight.
You will also not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge per camera, which the guardians of this natural park, together with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), require from the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human carrier.
"This work is for animals and not for humans," Madrusin, a 42-year-old bearer who has been working at Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school, protested.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he will continue “as long as possible” because he needs the money to raise his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life.
Even if the sulfur burns the throat and itches the eyes, when the wind suddenly turns and the miners get stuck in the thick columns rising from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about serious diseases ... of course, except for the usual breathing problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and blisters on the shoulders, which have become deformed by the weight of the basket shape.
With the basket on his back, Unainik is only able to carry 50 kg at the age of 53.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which is transported by three trucks via a goat path between the bush to the camp in Tamansari at 18 kilometers away.
“I’m not going to retire, I’m going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life,” Unainik explains, opening his mouth wide where some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the eldest also works as a sulfur carrier at the age of 30.
Time passes, but poverty persists generation after generation in one of the toughest professions in the world: those who work as human vices on the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singaporeans blame the fact that they don’t have children, on the career, stress, and cost of real estate and child rearing.
“The population of Singapore needs to grow.”
I am a patriotic husband, You are my patriotic wife: we fulfill our civic duty and create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for mint vouchers, but nevertheless – or precisely because of that – they became a viral video on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The sentences are part of a rapper's song, the local sayings such as "Shipping will be a "bao" (leaves) in the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, which has shot the video, holds the hope that the commercial achieves in a fun way to draw attention to the problem.
Her creative director Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill their “national duty.”
This is just for the internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
When we reproduce, we are the worst in the world, so we realized that it was a topic we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as the marketing of perfume with pheromones or the organization of speed dating evenings (fast flirting).
Perhaps many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought, why don’t we do something as creatively as possible to address this problem, such as composing a rap?
1.2 Children
Whoever does not take this issue lightly is the government of Singapore.
Every year, she spends $1,300 on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for married couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything had so far little success.
Singapore is a rich, highly technological city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was over 2 – also known as replacement rate – was in 1976.
So why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy at the National Population Authority, says this is due to a “better education” and “greater career opportunities.”
“This has allowed people to have far more options in terms of life goals and set priorities than marrying and forming a family,” she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the higher number of single persons and to the delay in marriage and births, the result of which is the reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration to counteract the reduction of the population led to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the barely-cased xenophobia blooms against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the ruling party in Singapore achieved its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem of higher contributions and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate has the known impact on a nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, health care costs, and immigration policies, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that not so many small apartments are being built.
It also has an impact on the housing market.
The Urban Development Authority has begun to control the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the single, and that they discourage construction companies from building large apartments for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, director general of the real estate company EL Developers, says that its "shoe boxes" can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out by days and even weeks faster than the larger housing units.
This means that they are much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new standards give developers clearer orientations, which were previously put in the way of obstacles if they wanted to build too many small residential units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, it should be noted that the talks with Singaporeans working in the financial district will not have a major effect.
“People are heavily stressed, the housing and education are expensive, which is why it is pushed out by many,” says a young manager.
Children can have others.
“For me, it’s important to have my own money and time,” says another, about twenty-year-old man.
Men and women lead their careers, the stress, and the cost of property and education as reasons why they can’t have children.
That’s why Singaporeans have the last word when it comes to having children – the government can still do so much.
Offline Private offline is online private
Privacy
According to the dictionary, this is the property of private or "that area of private life where one is entitled to protection from any kind of interference".
What is private for someone under the age of 16?
How is this definition applied to his everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he faces when he announces on the Internet situations he wouldn’t share in real life?
El Peri<0xC3><0xB3>dico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15 who are frequently on the Internet.
In four of the cases, they linked the term to “something very personal” on a personal level and “on the password and the user” when they applied it to social networks.
“My deepest secrets I wouldn’t disclose in a post,” says 10-year-old Jorge in an attempt to explain the meaning of “private” in websites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
“These are very confidential secrets, my mother is allowed to know them, but not the whole world,” he confirms.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also spend my time with acquaintances.
“I wouldn’t share a photo that isn’t from me, or from someone who makes the fool,” he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to post obscene photos, nudes, crimes, or abusive or violent comments.
Jorge assures to know 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers in Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
This includes the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up on Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if anyone will answer me, I’ll just upload them,” he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can quickly talk to relatives at a distance or with friends," he says.
Asked, he replied that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown person.
Even if someone felt a stranger, he would ignore it.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask, he admits not to know 20 of the people he added to his friend list.
“It doesn’t scare me because we have something in common, like music,” he says.
According to the boy, no one made him any suggestions or asked him for his address or telephone number.
“If someone bothers me or asks me to, I just remove it from my user account,” he admits.
José joined Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not unknown experience, which is now known as cyberbullying.
The friend of a friend was blackmailed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
“He never knew who it was,” he said.
According to José, the victim did not close the user account.
“He just did it privately.”
He then explains a number of steps to safely configure a user account.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would do that if he's unsympathetic to me or I want to wipe him out one.
“But I know this is cyberbullying,” he explains.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with a university degree in education and learning, believes that in order to orient the children and young people, it must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a medium for the search for information; with the appearance of these pages, however, the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that the academic Marc Prensky, owner of a master's degree in pedagogy at Yale University and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants" formed these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are them, the children and young people who grew up with this technology.
“We are the digital immigrants who should teach them where we still learn,” he says.
He explains that it is a complex topic, “because we require them to have a defined criterion on what can be disseminated, published or said, and this at an age where maturity is not sufficient.”
“They should also be picky when it’s most important for them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents is what privacy is to ask them questions that make them think.
“To tell them not to do it doesn’t work,” he says.
Porras then mentions a few possibilities: there are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like to publish a photo of you, like that you published by a friend?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
Have you previously asked the other people for permission if you have labeled photos of celebrations?
And one more question: Does everyone need to know what you’re doing at every moment?
Another point is to give them the understanding that they need to trade online, as they do offline.
They are the same rules.
“Someone outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to the social networks,” he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary school teacher and educational advisor, comments that it is essential that parents carefully read the guidelines of social networks.
When they understand all the sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
“For example, age, or what you can share or publish,” he explains.
According to Guardia, children need to be reminded of the lesson "You shouldn't talk to strangers".
Conclusion of the Unasur Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the Lima Declaration, which was previously announced and should theoretically be signed by the seven present rulers.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the VIth Ordinary Session of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur. Sources in the State and Presidential Chancellery initially announced that they would hand it over after the exam, but then explained that it would be published at some point on the Peruvian government's website.
When asked about the text, they stated that the content was presented to the press by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in brief statements.
The access of journalists to information about the summit meeting was limited at any time.
During the day, only the picture of the presidential meeting without sound was transmitted in the press room with the message "private session, limited audio".
The few information circulated among the journalists was received by the press speakers of some of the Unasur governments present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian press spokesman.
The only document widely circulated during the day was the list of participating presidents, which provoked discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more information.
After that, the Presidential Office of Peru sent the media an e-mail with the "final declaration" of the summit, but this was the declaration of Humala and not the official document for the conclusion of the summit.
Last October Peru hosted the Third Summit of South America - Arab States (ASPA), and on this occasion the so-called Lima Declaration, which had been announced earlier, was also not published, despite the press’ insistence.
On the official website of ASPA, you can be sure that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems were available for journalists, but they greatly restricted access to information.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Hague Court, which settles a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the IGH, which begins Monday in The Hague, in the process that Lima initiated against Santiago, the Pledoyers of both sides.
“We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences we are currently making to this international court,” Humala said, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country that adheres to international laws, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, concludes agreements and submits to international courts," Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era added, greeting Humala with a handshake before the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they would submit to the ICC was made after Colombia, after a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which considered a serious mistake, brought suit against the Bogot<0xC3><0xA1> Agreement, in which it agreed to submit to the judgments of this international court.
At the summit, the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner were present.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from Unsur since 2011 after the resignation of its president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and ended the summit meeting shortly after noon in Lima.
The head of state dropped the final document, announcing that 16 decisions had been taken and that the lines of action for 31 projects between South American countries totalled $17 billion.
Among the decisions taken, he said that the countries of Unasur "will take significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship, which is why we are extending the decisions on residence rights."
He said measures would be promoted to "enhancing cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and organised transnational crime, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act jointly and efficiently in the event of natural disasters".
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not take on triumphant traits, but should serve to expand our production performance and show our peoples a better future," Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 emblematic projects aimed at improving spatial connections in South America and especially in rural and border areas... thus uniting our countries and opening up new economic forms," the Peruvian president said in a statement.
Among these projects would also be five Peruvians who were on the transverse axes of their territory from the coast to Brazil, two of which should ensure a better connection with Ecuador, although he did not give any further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve for its resumption in the Union of South American Nations," he said.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighbourly relations was another aspect highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional meeting that he expected a meeting with his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico, to treat the maritime conflict respectfully, following a judgment of the IGH challenged by Bogot<0xC3><0xA1>.
“Perhaps I will meet with President Daniel Ortega on Saturday morning,” Santos said.
"We will review all these ways - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua also necessitates talks with Nicaragua," he said.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will deal with this matter as civilized and respectfully as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to be present at the inauguration of the new president of this country, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto.
As part of the summit meeting, the Block’s defence ministers also met in advance to adopt the 2013 action plan, in which dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region will be strengthened.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, even if the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru has the presidency at the time of the regional bloc.
“South America needs to learn to integrate its citizens,” says Rafael Correa
Ecuador’s president, Rafael Correa, today confirmed that creating a common citizenship is a goal, with “South America actually being able to learn something from Europe.”
Correa, who attended the 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which took place in Lima, explained to state television in Peru that Europeans "were killed in World War II and other conflicts" and "are practically a fatherland today."
In this sense, he defended the project of creating a South American citizenship that drives the member states of the Unasur.
“The free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean community; however, there are still reactionary sectors that seek to return to the past,” he warned.
The President of Ecuador also endorsed the reorganisation of the Organization of American States (OEA) with a view to reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account those who have signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit themselves to anything, and in return, we always sign everything to the South Americans.
“It’s incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is based in Washington and funded by the United States,” he said in a statement on the political asylum that Ecuador granted to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because it did not betray his principles, but fulfilled his “deep democratic values and views on human rights”.
He added that there were "reasonable assumptions at the time that Assange would be extradited to a third country and would not comply with his procedure."
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary, which had asked him to interrogate him on his territory for an alleged sexual assault, while "the Swedish case law allows this through a video conference that could have been conducted via Ecuador's embassy in London."
Correa explained that there was a risk that Assange’s health and mental health would be compromised.
"Since he's in our embassy, I haven't spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but not a serious one," Ecuador's head of state said.
However, there is a risk that he will suffer physical and psychological damage because he is trapped in a confined space and cannot perform outdoor physical exercises.
“That would affect the health of every person,” he added.
Correa stated that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London is the granting of a free letter to travel to Ecuador, and that this is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe, and that there have been talks with London to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not deal with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garz<0xC3><0xB3>n, leads a number of proceedings on various European instances," he said.
And "if Britain grants this free letter tomorrow, I think it's done."
And if Sweden interrogated Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or via Skype, as the Swedish case law allows and in other cases was done, the problem would be solved.
Correa took the opportunity to affirm himself as a defender of press freedom and said that what he does not tolerate is "the mediocrity, the evil intention, and the lie that discourages free speech."
“The biggest enemies of press freedom are not the evil and perverted politicians, but bad journalists who strive for profit and blackmail,” he said.
In this sense, he congratulated himself on the fact that Ecuador is no longer dominated by such journalists "and also by the bankers or hegemonic and spear-citizen countries", and anticipated that in a re-election he will "deepen the revolution in order to continue the path in this right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in Unasur at least until his next elections, arguing that the organism "must remain firm and not allow opportunism and no coup d'état to take place as legally disguised coup d'état" because it "destroyed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay."
The President of Ecuador also considers the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and following the judgment of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which favored the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries, "absolutely justified."
This judgment is currently not being implemented.
It is a problem between a South American and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in pursuit of a common path.
They need to be treated comprehensively so that you can overcome them and look forward.
Similarly, he relied on a good conclusion of disputes over the sea borders between Peru and Chile before the same court and said that "it is right for Latin America to call international instances if both countries commit to accept the judgment, even if it is very hard."
Regarding the possibility that he will stand as a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador in order to achieve his third consecutive mandate, he stated that he sees this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it is also very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would retire from political life.
Power has never interested me personally, but under such unjust circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
“My political movement had the belief that I was the one who guaranteed this probable victory, so I have to live up to that responsibility,” he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last period as president, after which I retire from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
“That’s decided,” he said.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the president of Venezuela, Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuela's vice president, Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s Maduro, who told me that he had travelled there for a planned, routine treatment and that he would be expected to be able to return to Cuba after the election campaign.
“In no case does it mean a relapse in the health of President Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez,” he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State took part today in Lima at the 6th Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with the call for greater regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
The cause of death from AIDS is a late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed to be HIV positive.
"It was as if a bomb struck," he says of the moment he received the diagnosis that the doctor "tried to weaken without apparent success."
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to learn about it; and this with such dedication that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was hard to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
Back then, even the director of a clinic at the IMSS avoided saying goodbye, "because it led to a dead end."
AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome even with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic who know nothing about their illness and where the virus has already done damage and exhausted their immune system, and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the occurrence of the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who takes up treatment on time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," explained the head of the HCG's HIV unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, who said that this information was supported by a prestigious scientific publication in April this year.
The infectious disease and HIV/AIDS expert, Andrade Villanueva, commented that, since 2008, scientists concluded that AIDS was not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life depended on the degree of impairment of the immune system of individuals at the beginning of treatment, and that those had greater chances of a count of 50 and a count of 50 years at the time of treatment: up to 30 years.
Simply put, the above statements mean that anyone who receives HIV-positive diagnosis at the age of 25 can “problemlessly turn 75 years old as long as they are under control,” the expert explained.
In order to properly classify this progress, it must be remembered that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Even if mortality has significantly decreased in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (ONUSIDA Annual Report), it is nevertheless true that since the advent of AIDS, 60 percent of patients recorded in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011 and by the month of May of this year there are already 187 deaths; however, it is assured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral medicines since 2005.
- So why are people still dying?
In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we have not had any supply problems with the drugs. The problem is that people come in far advanced condition because they do not know their infection state, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: “Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. In order to be able to influence global mortality, earlier diagnoses are needed, which is why all people who need this need to be offered massive detection tests.”
The experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevenci<0xC3><0xB3>n del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on AIDS Prevention in Jalisco) and also the patients like Fabrizio, who had his test carried out at a private laboratory, and this for the only reason that it had made a friend of his who, despite his young age, had already been in AIDS-Pha.
Everything is different when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they will die, and don’t want to hear anything.
"If I have to die already, then I'd rather burst three times," they say in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, exercise and take the medication.
Today his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, just like anyone else.
“I work, do a lot, have an active but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person,” says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to animate with his testimony those who are afraid today as part of the worldwide AIDS Day.
They should take the test if they belong to the risk group. The sooner they know if they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the shop table
There are big holes between the health programs and the ordinary citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has accepted the issue of HIV.
The most important thing is prevention.
“In the designated places, the distribution of condoms was actually increased; earlier they were given out individually, now they give us parcels with a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom,” he said.
The risk factors for new infections include young people.
"Why do you need that?" is a common mockery of social workers, orientation staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the health care system who do not want to expose young people, the correspondent assured.
He suggested reorienting this inefficient distribution; the condoms should be located not only behind the store table, but in output devices in public toilets of facilities frequented by young people.
It is not intended to promote promiscuity.
They should not be paid for the beer and motel, as Governor Emilio Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez responded to the question of whether conservatives would be distributed under his administration.
“Sexuality doesn’t look like that; it’s best to bring the condoms closer to those who are already engaged in sexual activity,” he said.
Key data of Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is ranked 4th nationally in new and cumulated AIDS cases, and 13th in terms of HIV.
92% of infections occur via sexual intercourse, 6% via blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because for every registered case there are 4 or 5 people who do not know it.
After the United States Court of Appeal has confirmed a ruling that does not recognise the restructuring of the Vitro Group’s liabilities achieved through a trade bankruptcy in Mexico, an incurable precedent is created for any national company with subsidiaries in the neighbouring country that has payment problems.
So it could be said that the procedures for the survival of companies that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of the stars and stripes in contravention of international agreements.
In practice, the recognition of the ruling by Judge Harlin Hale at the Bancarrotas Court for the Northern District of Texas on June 15 leads Mexican companies to be helpless to seize their property beyond the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens the door to the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the United States Supreme Court for three inconsistencies.
While the judge of the case points out that creditors must be subject to United States bankruptcy law, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal, based in New Orleans, initially says that the main proceedings are the trade bankruptcy dealt with in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in insolvency proceedings of cross-border companies is not known.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law was created for the unification of international trade law, using the American Law Institute as a conciliator.
Second, the judgment states that without the votes of the companies after recognition of the liabilities in the bankruptcy proceedings held by the branches of Vitro with their parent company, the necessary majority for the restructuring of the liabilities would not have been reached.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case where this scheme has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities among companies of the group have been confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles.
It is also true that, after the vote of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who sued Vitro in the United States courts, i.e. the vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is to blame for its difficult situation from 2008 in the context of the major economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country blows.
For this reason, the Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez Sada family objects to the same appellate court in order for the vote to take place in the plenary, i.e. by all judges, because only three of them voted.
If this is not granted, the Cerciorare opposition is filed, which calls for the review of the proceedings by a higher authority, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The serious thing about this case is that the court dropped a document sent by the government of Mexico under the figura amicus curiae (friend of the court), which describes the procedure conducted by Vitro under the Trade Concourses Act, and which points out that it had strictly adhered to the agreements signed by both countries to the United States in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the Concourse Act.
In addition, it is pointed out that the country has been subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the established rules for cases of cross-border inability to pay, which guarantee the equality of debtors and creditors.
Two-banded carambole: a blow for Vitro and for the country.
General balance sheet
After the announcements by the Mexican Air Transport Unions against the former owner Gast<0xC3><0xB3>n Azc<0xC3><0xA1>rraga Andrade, who is accused of a fraudulent administration, did not advance for several months, the Asociaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores has finally made progress.
The application, led by Carlos D<0xC3><0xAD>az Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez Morineau, has now filed a criminal case against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
Subsequently, the supervisory authority systematically refused to inform the head office of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to withdraw from the trustee account F/589 of Bank IXE under the name Mexicana de Aviaci<0xC3><0xB3>n 198 million pesos.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares of the Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (professional hotel management).
As you know, Azc<0xC3><0xA1>rraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the hotel chain Posadas.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a weekend meeting at a forum of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society have decided to create a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, complemented by a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
In advance, the Canacintra (the national chamber of manufacturing industry) has achieved the unification of the governors of the south-east in order to oppose the monumental establishment, which partly destroyed protected areas and represents the mother of all threats to the industry.
ACTA is dead.
Because the government has failed to comply with a request by the Senate to explain under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican ambassadors in Japan signed the anti-counterfeiting trade agreement known under the English acronym ACTA, the matter has already been archived, according to the Mexican Institute for Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures took place, although the Senate had disregarded the possibility of considering them as a violation of freedom of expression on social networks.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Hector "Hetin" Reyes, the basketball world-bummer, has been associated with basketball for more than 60 years and has traveled the world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large spiritual collection of the country’s history of basketball as Héctor “Hetin” Reyes.
Before being tied to the wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, whether as a lower-class player, first national league player, delegate and head of the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n or president of the Basketball Association.
“All my life, I’ve put on a lot of hats in basketball, even several at the same time when I was president of the BSN, chief executive officer of the national team and president of the association in the 90s,” Reyes recalled on a visit to his home in Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
“Basketball was my life.”
Reyes does not exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify to them.
Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n in the heart
The most emotional memories are those that recall his time at the Vaqueros from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15th anniversary as co-manager or managing director of the club.
“These were my best years that I enjoyed the most because I was allowed to be part of eight Vaqueros championships since 1967 as managing director, co-manager or coach.
It was many fulfilling years, including the five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye with a championship in 1981, the year of Jerome Mincy’s debut at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" took over Ortiz, who was a very good manager," Reyes says.
I remember Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), saying, "I have a very strong and 2 m player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended the free throw specialist Raymond Gausse, who let himself be a citizen and was one of our best throwers.
I remember how he said that if Mincy had allowed a championship for Bayamon, Gausse would provide another.
The Vaqueros Championship with Gausse was granted to him, but already from a distance, because he was already at the top of the association in 1988.
At that time he preferred to enjoy his executions and that of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we won for the first time at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico against the US.
After that came the 1990 World Cup, in which we took fourth place, which should have been bronze, if not that Canadian referee who let us repeat the last move for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this group of the 1990 World Cup the best national team you have ever seen?
She is one of the best, as well as those who won against the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
My favorite, however, is the 1991 Pan American Games team in Cuba, where we won gold and offered the US team a fight, as they did back then when they won bronze against us at the World Cup.
Not only were Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico L<0xC3><0xB3>pez and "Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n" (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "To<0xC3><0xB1>ito" Col<0xC3><0xB3>n and James Carter, the brothers Le<0xC3><0xB3>n (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be there in 1990 due to a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which gave us great pleasure, was the one of the 1995 pre-Olympics tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a substitute for the locked players because of the events at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against any prognosis.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
This was, without a doubt, Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n Ortiz.
His numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as much as Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n.
And this without taking into account his career in the different leagues in which he played.
Who was the best coach in Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you think is the best thing you have achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN in the early 1990s up to 17 teams in one season.
What else do you have to do?
There are things I would have introduced, such as the regionalization of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, only play in their area and only meet in the national playoffs on teams from other corners of the island.
Today, children make unnecessary trips and games.
At least I see the result of the prescribed trainings and courses for trainers, table officials and referees.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to listen to music, watch videos of music of my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally I go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always by my side.
Larry Hagman is dead.
Born in Forth Worth, Texas, on September 21, 1931, Larry Hagman became famous worldwide with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas", where he played a ruthless, insidious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the greed of the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a family press release to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role that he liked the most," the family said.
Larry’s family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving celebrations.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and follow-up series, was with Hagman when he died in Dallas hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
He made all the people who knew him happy.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found in his liver, and he underwent transplantation.
In the years before "Dallas", Hagman became known on television as a nice guy from 1965 to 1970 with the sitcom "Amazing Jeannie" of the NBC television station.
There he played astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is turned upside down when he meets an attractive "Jinn" (played by Barbara Eden) who will live with him at home.
He was also an actor of two comedies that were broadcast only for a short time, such as "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His cinematic works included critically acclaimed roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the enchantingly despicable J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the CBS television chain about the Ewing clan and other characters in its surroundings was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The ad saying "Who shot at J.R.?", which was supposed to create expectation for an episode full of emotions, where Hagmann's figure was almost killed, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were wagered in betting houses.
The series reached a spectator record at that time.
When the answer became known in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers who turned "Dallas" into the second most-watched entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin, the sister-in-law of J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had shot.
J.R. had restrained her and threatened to portray her as a prostitute if she did not leave the city, but others had reasons to want to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a devious businessman and infidel husband who aspired to have his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what to put on the tombstone of J.R.," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be called "Here rests the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only business he didn’t win.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as an "enormous personality on and off the screen".
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of devotees in the world and remains in our hearts for those of us who have been fortunate enough to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new issue of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the television channel TNT.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was just being filmed, the broadcaster informed.
There was no immediate explanation from Warner or TNT as to how Hagmann’s loss would be treated in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she got Larry during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the theatre stages in New York in the early 1950s, after which he served in the air forces in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the Californian town of Malibu, where many celebrities resided.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
“I didn’t write anything that I believed could harm or affect someone in any way,” the Associated Press said.
After the liver transplant, he advocated for liver donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist anxious patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet with them when their operations are imminent and after," he explained in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, such as "Don't be afraid, it's a bit uncomfortable the first time, but you'll be fine".
He also campaigned against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Start of the course that studies the "end of the world"
Every week, students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs, and global warming.
Every semester, when the professor of religion decided to hold a course over the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible fishing hook: the end of the "long backward count" of the Mayan calendar on December 21, which many people believed meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect in the following two months: the destructive Hurricane Sandy, some of whom have called “Deudarmaggedon,” as well as a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theorists believe the Apocalypse begins.
“I didn’t realize this will be the most apocalyptic semester ever,” Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University, New Jersey, this week.
If someone analyses what has happened in the world today, as if we were thirty days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And he recalls that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor who this semester, which should actually be the last in history, offers courses on the "end of the world".
In Temple, Professor Barry Vacker gives the course “Media, Culture and the End of the World.”
Every week, students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs, and global warming.
“We analyze why these ideas spread over time,” he said, as well as the way hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a certain human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, a war could break out.
This month, students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they could be compared to real life.
"I have tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," Vacker said.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a fellow professor of art history and anthropology, have formed a team to offer a course called "The End of the World".
“We don’t pick up in 2012 so we always have the option to re-take the course in case the world doesn’t go down,” Restall said.
Despite the "prompt demise", students must study, create projects and participate in final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam is conducted on the eve of the Apocalypse, which is why students have no other chance than “to continue working until night, where the world supposedly ends,” Restall said.
The courses were very popular.
“In two hours, there were no more places,” said Restall about his course for high-average students, which was filled with 35 students.
Weeks before the start of the semester, we received emails from students asking if there are still seats available.
Students in turn assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers' religion and sociology camden from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect or religious mentality is actually only a matter of comfort or lack thereof.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa for psychology and nursing explains that he has seen all apocalyptic films.
“I have never heard of a lesson where this is taught,” he said.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students surveyed — and less than a professor — declared to believe in the last date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the prophecy of the Mayans, and in a certain way we discredit them," said Julie Zeglen, a student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
He notes, however, that in Western society there is an apocalyptic fear that dates back several centuries when people reacted to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world.
The internet has increased these speculations.
“People don’t think that way elsewhere,” he says.
This is mainly the case in the English speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who teaches in the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question of whether he would know a course there about the "end of the world".
“The Philippines does not participate at the end of the world,” he wrote as an indication of an exception to a higher instance.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days were spoken by the last court, saying that if nothing happens on December 21, "people immediately think of a new date" or philosophized that December 21 was the beginning of a seven-year period after which the end of the world came.
Students and professors take this date easily.
Several said that they want to go to celebrations about "the end of the world".
“Maybe I’ll call a few friends so we can laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
