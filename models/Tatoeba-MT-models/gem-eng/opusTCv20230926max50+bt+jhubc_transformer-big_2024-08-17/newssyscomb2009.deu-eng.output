Triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, overall they come to 29 percent
A noticeable weakening of both parties in the previous great coalition and a significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties brought about after the first preliminary results the early parliamentary elections of Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP) suffered particularly heavy losses, where the position of former chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the cusp.
In contrast, the head of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), the K<0xC3><0xA4>rntner Landeshauptmann Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphant return to federal politics.
According to the results so far, Social Democracy (SP<0xC3><0x96>) remains the strongest force in the country with 29.8 percent of the vote, but it loses 5.5 percent of the vote compared to the last elections in 2006.
Even worse was the <0xC3><0x96>VP, which lost almost nine percent of the vote with 25.6%.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in Austrian post-war history, and especially in the People's Party, which had demanded the early elections, this is a truly disastrous result.
Even at the beginning of July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP had left the coalition, the People's Party had a clear lead ahead of the SP<0xC3><0x96>.
The voters, however, have probably punished the party for failing the government.
Already in the first reactions to the results there was speculation about a possible resignation of the party chairman and former vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could already be the case at an extraordinary meeting of the party board on Monday.
Such a development would probably pave the way to the most likely way out of the electoral debacle, i.e. to a renewal of the large coalition of SP<0xC3><0x96> and <0xC3><0x96>VP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Freedom Party (FP<0xC3><0x96>), 18 per cent received provisionally, the BZ<0xC3><0x96> 11 per cent of the votes - the Social Democrats, at the same time, expressed their concern that the year 1999 could be repeated when the People's Party agreed with the populists (then even the FP<0xC3><0x96> had been formed uniformly, in 2005 had been sanctioned by the BZ<0xC3><0x96> in terms).
This development is obviously based on Jörg Haider, who already stated that he was willing to cooperate with each party and assumes a return to Vienna to the Austrian federal policy.
The Green Party also entered parliament, but suffered slight losses and broke down from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably mastered the four-percent threshold and, as a result, did not move into parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool down
If it is not possible to solve the problem with the Czech scientists accused in India of illegally collecting beetles, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg believes there could be some cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
This was emphasized by the minister in New York after today’s meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this is not clear, then sure, then there will be some cooling," he explained after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks that in court matters the executive could hardly intervene.
Despite all this, he stated that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>v<0xC3><0xA1>cha, who was acquitted of the charge and received a fine, the central government wanted the case with the local government in Dardjiling, in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, who has been sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherdshi's view would be best if he were to appeal at a higher instance.
He could so request for release on bail and wait in freedom for his verdict, the minister said.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had said the same in negotiations.
“He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then a pardon would be in question for him,” said the head of the Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to have the convicted "competent legal support" indicated by the Indian minister.
At the same time, he said that such help was already offered to them by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India that have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also admit it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, the Czech press agency <0xC4><0x8C>TK, in front of its partner, confirmed the Czech Republic’s importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really think it's a big mistake to arrest and prosecute these Czech scientists," he said.
An answer to the question of whether he had received from the Indian side the promise to deal with the matter, was eliminated by the Minister.
“I’ve already been promised a lot,” he said.
A Czech judge over the ringing around the seabed
It enters an electronic map showing Australia and the adjacent sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with it also the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself," said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is one of the thirty-member staff of the UN Division of Oceans and Sea Rights.
His boss, the division director, the Czech lawyer V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and supplements it on and on.
This is where work and enthusiasm prevail.
So far, the seabed contains a little-known world rich in natural springs.
Here oil, ore and other non-renewable raw materials can be found, but also previously unknown living organisms, which carry the key to the development of a drug against cancer.
A seabed larger than the mainland
The neighbouring states today vehemently announced their claim to the new sea areas.
According to a UN convention, they make use of their rights, which they agreed to in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches into the sea a few hundred kilometers far from the shore of a country.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive right to all sources of the continental shelf.
Simplified, as a continental shelf, the part of the seabed and its soles is considered a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It crosses the borders of the shore, often also the border of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," Mikulka explains.
The application submitted by the relevant country to the Commission to establish the external borders of the continental shelf must be substantiated by extensive scientific and technical documentation, based on many cost-intensive investigations and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide technical and legal support to the Commission.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have had success," Mikulka added.
An international echo recently came across the success of Australia, which was the first country to be able to significantly increase its sea areas.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the extent of the seabed granted to the country by the Commission last week is about 1.6 million square kilometers, about six times more than the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigation.
The profit that will flow to them in the future from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, have an invaluable value.
Other countries will also gradually submit their applications.
You can do this for ten years from the moment you ratify the “Agreement of Montego Bay.”
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor, which is referred to by the convention as "the common heritage of humanity", begins.
No other state has a special position here.
The right to promote in this area shall be conferred on an international institution established by the Convention.
"But the seabed is not a gold burial ground," says with some exaggeration Director Mikulka, adding that "individual territories are legally defined and the system is contractually anchored".
Czech Republic in the Pacific
Part of the seabed is now also part of the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern Bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
It was granted the status of a so-called "breaking investor" in 1991 by virtue of the Convention, as well as by the investors of a few other states.
The organization has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton Zone in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is divided there, it is a kind of tatra on the seabed.
"You can promote there on an area of a total of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetal concretions that contain nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," according to another lawyer, the Indian Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the Rober Sandev Division brings such a concretion as a pattern.
It is reminiscent of a small potato or, with some imagination, of the fabulous shem that has brought the legend to life after the Golem.
German special forces were on site at the time of the liberation of the hostages
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany to resolve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it got serious, the special units were ready, but they were not used.
European tourists kidnapped in Egypt are becoming increasingly familiar with the circumstances of the liberation of eleven European tourists.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
According to this, both specialists of the Bundeswehr as well as officials of the GSG 9, the flight staff of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Police Office and logistics experts of the Technical Aid Centre were at the site of the liberation.
However, German forces were not needed, as ministers said on Monday evening, because the hostages let their prisoners run and fled when they recognized signs of a violent liberation.
The Egyptian government has accepted the aid offered by Germany to involve it as a support force on the ground.
"Fortunately, this has not happened," a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said.
Attackers had kidnapped the group from the five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian woman and her eight Egyptian companions on September 19 in southern Egypt.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in the south of Egypt, the hostages in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad had been dragged back and forth.
The identity of the hostage-takers remained unclear until the end as well as the details of the exemption or possible ransom payments.
The rescued have now arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were in the custody of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
In Berlin, there was no information at first when they returned to Germany.
According to the Bild newspaper, the five holidaymakers and the special forces are to be flown out with an Airbus of the Luftwaffe and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives Rejects Rescue Package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has failed the $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones went deep.
With 206 to 227 votes, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout package for the financial markets.
Despite all calls by US President George W. Bush and leading politicians from both parties, there was no majority for the program to contain the chaos in the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the proponents had desperately tried to convince the critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, had called for the MPs to agree, even if the plan was unpopular.
“It’s hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn’t happened yet,” he admitted.
In the course of the vote, the Dow Jones dropped by more than six percent or by 600 points.
The reason was investors’ concerns that the state bailout package could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after becoming aware of the failure, crashed again.
Experts now expect further severe turbulence in the international financial markets.
The approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is necessary to enter into force of the programme.
Organizers record rising booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
In the case of travel bookings for the coming months, sales have increased significantly compared to the previous year, according to one study - even by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic prospects, according to a study, the German’s desire for travel remains undisturbed.
When booking for the winter season, the travel agencies recorded an increase in sales of 31 percent compared to the same period of the previous year, as the German Travel Association (DRV) announced on Monday in Berlin.
According to the market research institute GfK, bookings have already increased for the autumn months.
For example, the increase in turnover of travel agencies for October was around 11 percent compared to 2007, the DRV said.
These results are based on figures from the GfK, which evaluates monthly booking data from 1200 German travel agencies and calculates them for the overall market.
The travel bookings made until the end of August 2008 were recorded.
Due to the weak dollar exchange rate, travel to the US is particularly in demand, the DRV said.
Here, the booking growth is about a third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the local areas, are particularly sought-after destinations among the Germans.
Packages in particular are high on the course, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising costs of energy and food, the costs here are "more calculable for the customer than for the individually organized holiday".
Money could save consumers, among other things, through early booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months were also very well booked, so there will be an increase in sales compared to the previous year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who made a trip fell compared to the previous year.
My first time at Oktoberfest
Ballermann apres ski hits in the endless loop, beer made of liter crutches and celebrities in designer dirndln.
A Wiesn debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don’t really have much in common.
She is blonde, TV presenter and wears a tailor-made dirndl.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing unites us: barely three minutes on the meadow, the photographers are already jumping on us and snapping the memory cards full - very flattering and that on my first visit to the meadow.
This is how you make friends.
The cheap dirndl seems to fulfill its purpose.
As a Wiesn-Touri and actually located north of the white sausage equator, the feeling of well-being in the costume was still limited to date.
But once you arrive at the Theresienwiese, everything is half as bad.
Almost everyone wears dirndl or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed - all completely normal.
Strange looks at the chocolate banana stand only harvest my dirndl skirt.
A Munich woman reminds me that I had wrongly tied the apron: "Left cough free, middle virgin, right forgiven, at the back widowed."
Secretly, I froze the loop from the back to the left.
"Sure," he said, laughing.
Others make less effort with subtle flirting techniques and wear plain felt hats on which "To drunk to get dressed!" stands and stretch towards an uninvited back.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitude is named Bob, comes from England and also visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a long-drawn "ooooo".
He tells me this after he has gotten rid of his previously drunk measure.
Right next to one of these hydrants, everyone thinks he's a trash can.
So Bob is one of those infamous "Wildbies".
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight o’clock in the evening, medics run in crowds over the festival grounds, which have to take care of the poor swallows.
The nurses always appear in the pack - always four at a time carry a covered carry from tent to tent.
This works like most Wiesn visitors: Empty, fully back.
You can't see who's under the plane in the Promille sarg.
“These are the ones that gourmands pack,” one of the medics called to me on request and disappeared in the noise.
Name of accident victim announced by police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, a resident of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city centre.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident for suspected reckless driving.
He was released on bail.
Turkey expands diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in penetrating deep into Turkey’s hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, stands one of the finest relics of this failed imperial endeavor.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that’s what the guides tell you.
The building sits rittlings at the end of the platform with a tower at every corner of the front and thus looks like any provincial German town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building is falling apart.
But once inside the vaulted ticket counter, there is no doubt about the grandeur of the project, whose western access was that.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Bagdad Society.
Germany, which was a specter in the imperialist game, had to implement its ambitions to dominate the Middle East, by means of a train connection to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond to what is today Saudi Arabia.
However, Germany’s imperialist projects crippled during the First World War.
His railroad tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, created by the insurmountable borders of the cold war, has disappeared.
British forces moved out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there were also bad news for the Hyderabad station.
In 1917, an ammunition train flew into the air, destroying the artistic roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly crumbled, far from the story.
Today, however, this railway line serves, at least symbolically, as a gateway to Anatolia and everything east of it, to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of the Tükei.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has introduced a bold new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the neighbouring regions, created by the borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
There is now a policy of rapprochement.
Notably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian splinter groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the key data of this new foreign policy, I have taken the night train to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the AKP, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a bumpy ride on tracks that produced the equanimity of the old world in the well-known documentary "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is regarded as a new city, for the new secular state plan to turn the Ottoman past back.
However, the AKP, known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish unity.
This has sparked a lot of distrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi took me to the AKP headquarters, a specially crafted, state-of-the-art stone and steel construction, in a developing suburb surrounded by semi-finished shopping malls and pubs where middle managers met in suits, both men and women, to complete the first shops of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician of almost any other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he even wrapped a blackberry.
“The aim of the party’s foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbours.
The Cold War was an exception,” he told me.
Turkey had been cut off from its hinterland.
Today, it has to look east and west at the same time.
There would not be either one or the other.
She would have to do both.
"But surely Turkey could at some point," I asked, "be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "did not want to face this decision."
He then highlighted a point that almost everyone I spoke to here routinely said: Turkey’s relations, not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are just as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be that, in the figurative sense, Europe as a whole can travel on the railway tracks eastward towards Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha’s station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German lordships, Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had been watching the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East could now, to a large extent, be in the hands of Turkey.
And when I was waiting at the dock for the ferry, which was supposed to take me back over the Bosphorus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe".
At the time, at least, there seemed to be little doubt as to which continent should have a claim to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Death" Handley was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Chorus.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
He was meant for young people up to 21 years old, but when the choir sang for the last time in 1979, some of us were already late 20 - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological shape changer) stood for the choir's willingness and ability to tackle any piece of music that was presented to him, whether it was a madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting and stood alone thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that has never faded for years.
How often did death hold us to “let the music speak for itself.”
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in the music.
So sing it!"
His manner of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never lordly, but never superfluous.
No matter how high the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher one.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor should have been beaten to the knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, when he directed the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I’ve been writing reviews for over a hundred of his concerts and I can honestly say that I’ve never been disappointed by a single one – often I was inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He detests conductors who, according to his words, simply "went to house with one or two known show horses in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In her obituary for William Woodruff (September 25), she writes that "in 1946 he resumed teaching economic history in Oxford and in 1950 received a Houblon-Norman research scholarship ... while studying at the same time for a BSc, an MA and a PhD.
This is a conclusion from an author's comment in Woodruff's book "Beyond Nab End", but it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham and during this time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, which was later published in 1958 as "The British Rubber Industry".
He was in the United States from 1950 to 1951 as part of a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard, and New York.
In 1953, he left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to cover up this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
<0x60>I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino <0x60>Flamenco and Life', because his photographs in black and white, in the documentary style, are fantastic.
They alerted me to them because of their simplicity and the power they radiate, as they always deal with the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of emotions.
Resino knows how to find the magical moments."
Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November, Honda will begin marketing the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While its predecessor model had a large interior, this wide-body sedan offers a much larger one.
In addition, there are also the technical intricacies that allow even more convenient driving and fuel saving.
Changes before the upcoming revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically speaking, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes made in this grand limousine are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new room flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics will be emphasized.
Nevertheless, before you start analyzing the new model, you have to say that this new jazz appears six years later after the first generation had appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda, compared to the other manufacturers, managed to renew this model for a shorter period of time.
Although the Honda Jazz is less well known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon in terms of its sales in the other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where jazz is the best-selling car of the year 2002 and also during this year 2008.
After jazz appeared on the market, about one million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda is trying to increase the sale of the new Jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese companies sold a total of 83,000 models of jazz in 2007, the expected estimates amount to 10,000 cars, which is 17% of the expected growth in the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 jazz models since 2002, representing 6.7% of the total sales at Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation of the model, the head of the store in Spain expects to be able to sell 2,000 jazz models per year.
More precisely, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model allows to cover up the sales drop in Spain.
In reality, the brand’s leaders hope to complete the year with a total sales of 22,000 models, which is 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a 16% reduction.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain to 1.8% compared to the previous year (1.6%).
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this share, Honda relies on the appearance of a new model.
It is Insight, a hybrid car with 5 doors and a compact size of 4.7 meters in length, the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 models a year around the world.
According to the Japanese manufacturer’s market estimates, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remaining share is distributed across the Old Continent and Japan.
The appearance of Insight on the market is planned for the first months of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz is growing in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, this leads to the assumption that it has become 5 centimeters larger.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Along with increasing the dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new space flexibility program and, on the other hand, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution that was also used in the predecessor model of Jazz.
The capacity of the trunk, which has a system of double loading area, also reaches up to 339 liters, i.e. 19 liters larger than the capacity of the trunk of the first generation.
It must be stressed that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4 litre petrol engine, because the capacity of the trunk of the Honda Jazz with a 1.2 litre petrol engine is 379 litres.
Among other improvements, apart from additional equipment such as leather seats or the possibility to install panoramic windows, improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the back doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz having only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 versions of the petrol engines: 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which allows for low fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions, have excellent technical performance and at the same time provides high-torque performance for the entire engine life.
The first version with 1.2 liters achieves the power of 90 hp at 6,000 revolutions with maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 min?1.
This petrol engine - the predecessor model of Jazz reaches 78 hp - has 5.3 liters of petrol consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the predecessor engine, which reached 83 hp in the previous generation, it now manages to reach 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5.4 liters of fuel consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
“Auto-Beene” Avoiding Collisions
In order to advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired by nature, more precisely, by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight goes back to the swarming behavior of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in accident prevention technologies.
The engineers from the technical development center of Nissan Motor Co. have developed this small robot in cooperation with Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Head of Technology PR and R&D Brand Management, the BR23C is an extension of the four-layer Nissan safety shield.
This robot is designed to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid the collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval-shaped airspace, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the bee’s facet eyes, which can see over an angle of 300 degrees in all directions, allowing her to fly undisturbed in her personal airspace without interruption.
In order to replicate the all-round perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
He observes obstacles that are located at a distance of up to two meters in front of the BR23C and are at a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor, which is directly translated into signal for avoiding the collision.
The moment obstacles are noticed, the little robot will imitate the bee flight and immediately change direction by turning its wheels around 90o or even greater angles to avoid the collision.
The biggest difference to any other system is that this avoidance maneuver takes place absolutely instinctively.
If not, the robot might not be able to respond with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the lead engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot can neither deviate upwards nor downwards, but also not at the top; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to turn its wheels and not in the infinite directions and in the infinite way that the bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and deceleration functions, so that the small robot avoids the collisions.
<0x60>This device only needs to process the information every couple of seconds and act according to this information.
It does not require either the information or the intuitive logic of the actions taken, so it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of storage space.
This sounds surprising, but it’s not about the GBs and not even the MBs of storage space.
This is the first step in developing the technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology Nissan predicts to introduce to the production cars in the next ten years.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than a variety of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system through satellite to guide you to the destination while driving, avoiding the obstacles along the way.
She is shaking before being charged with a mortgage.
It must be recognized that the U.S. Treasury Department, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis and to avoid the US citizens getting involved in mortgage histories of the supposedly payable banks, a fun and informative game was developed for the Internet surfers: ‘Bad Credit Hotel’.
Or maybe the ‘hotel of bad credit’ or of confusion.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think one, two and up to three times about whether it is time to ask for no credit.
And especially where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
Certainly, it has useful information, but without details.
This is more of a side for the teenagers than a place for all the spectators.
What will happen if the game is expanded?
Well, when a dreamy room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it’s not about buying a better house
Morgan Stanley makes its capital available to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into its company, making it the first bank in Japan to spend $9 billion, taking over 21% of its capital, an innovation that is due to a strong fall in its exchange rate.
A week after a preliminary settlement was made public, the two banks declared that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley tribal power at a uniform price of $25.25, resulting in a total amount of $3 billion.
The assumed price is less than 19% of the price value of the stock as of 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will secure a profit of 10% and can be resold at a price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global business will be conducted on the basis of a uniform average price of $29, i.e. 28% above the current price.
The Morgan Stanley share, however, fell by 6.79% to $23.07 by 17.00 GMT.
“This strategic link represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to the status of a holding bank,” said John Mack, Director General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley has assumed this status last week, which will allow him to expand his business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Their connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street’s biggest names to adopt a much more cautious stance than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement has changed over the past few days: Last Monday, Morgan had simply stated that she would sell up to 20% of her shares to Japan for about $8.5 billion.
“A week ago,” Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG, said in Tokyo, “we thought the stake would consist entirely of common shares.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and secure ourselves.”
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below its price for its Morgan Stanley shares.
And the business will go ahead with a reduction in profit by about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that in one year MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into common shares if the latter are exchanged for more than 50% above the sales value within a given period, i.e. approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds provided by MUFG will allow him to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen their balance sheet and increase their sales.
However, a group press spokesman refused to provide more detailed information on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After investing in MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be able to book a solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan stated that his balance sheet had “clearly lowered” since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been hard for the group to watch as their stock market price declined by half, while the price of insurance against inability to pay increased.
This price declined on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other “survivor” of the major investment banks on Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, announced last week that he had raised $15 billion, in part at Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Re-establishing the republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of the Venezuelan Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
It was the third person who, following the example of his peers and friends, put the plan for a new constitution to the vote this Sunday.
Mission accomplished, because according to the public results of 80% of the votes cast, 64% voted ‘yes’ in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% voted ‘No’, 7% of ballots were invalid and 0.7% were left blank.
In order for the constitutional project to be adopted, one vote must be obtained more than half of all votes cast.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the polling stations’ exits and a count of a non-governmental organization had announced a clear victory for ‘yes’, predicting it 63% to 70%.
On the night of Sunday to Monday, Rafael Correa had demanded the victory of his constitutional project.
The “constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly,” he had assured in Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 kilometers southwest of Quito, and congratulated the Equatorians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez and Morales, but also by his Chilean like-minded Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which was held in silence according to the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text consisting of 444 points to secure the “new socialism” for which the President advocates.
The constitutional project transfers state power to the economy by giving it the sole right to ‘development planning’ in a country that lives largely from oil production by foreign companies and the foreign exchange, sending the emigrants to the country.
The project, which will be pushed forward by the Correa elected in 2006, will also allow the Head of State more comprehensive power, which will be able to exercise up to two consecutive mandates of four years each, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa already announced that he will use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also secures the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already begun to introduce in this country with 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population live below the poverty line.
In the end, it also envisages banning the presence of foreign troops, which will bring an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an Equatorial Base as the starting point for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were freed in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions who had been captured ten days ago.
They are in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held captive in the desert for eleven days, were returned to the Egyptian capital safely and unharmed this Monday afternoon.
In the morning they were liberated by an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages reached al-Maza military base right next to Cairo International Airport at around 3.30 p.m. aboard a special aircraft.
They were taken directly without being able to speak to the press, aboard a helicopter, to the hospital of Maadi, a foreign district of Cairo, to be examined there.
They all enjoy ‘best health’ and the kidnappers ‘didn’t get a ransom’, Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garanna explained on the rolling field.
After being captured on 19 September at an off-road safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was repeatedly taken by 35 unknown kidnappers from one hideout to the next.
These are eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four chauffeurs, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptus, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security officer explained that 30 members of the special forces, from aboard two helicopters, launched the attack at night, just before dawn.
“On both sides, shots fell and half of the hijackers were killed, the rest fled,” said the person in charge, who wants to remain anonymous.
He explained that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of the Italian diplomats Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade where he is, about the role secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces have played.
“We have to acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and performance of our men from the intelligence service and the special forces,” he explained without further details.
He also denied that a ransom had been paid.
On the eve of the incident, the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped an off-road vehicle at a patrol, in which the hijackers were located, of which they killed six, including the Chadian leader, and two arrested.
The army stated that they were connected to a rebel group from Darfour, the Libération du Soudan-Unité (SLA-U) movement, which, however, immediately denied this movement.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate about the financing of culture makes headlines and is central to the current election campaign.
All the better.
But an area of our cultural life remains in oblivion.
Who will stand up and denounce the miserable sums granted to the small museums, the archives, the archaeological excavations or the national historical sites that starve to death?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government that it is neglecting its monuments and culturally significant buildings?
That there are no right laws in Quebec, as well as in Canada, that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is providing 3.5 million euros for the restoration of the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau de Chinon in the Loire Valley alone?
It is written in the Constitution of our American neighbors that the protection of the cultural heritage belongs to the culture of the American, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all MPs and all government districts, in mutual agreement.
In Quebec, in the association of Quebec’s history societies, at least 40,000 volunteers, gathered in 211 history societies, strive to deal intensively with history, save the numerous private archives with a few grotesques, and preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage who protest with the power of desperation when promoters and decision-makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux Governments Nationalize Parts of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalisation, the Benelux countries want to seize the arms of the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank, which has been hit by the US financial crisis in turbulence: the three countries provide a total of EUR 11.2 billion to the banking and insurance institution, which, incidentally, also has branches in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands consulted at the highest level on the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commissioner of the Competition Authority of the European Commission.
In the eurozone, Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been ongoing for a year, so decisions that are now made in connection with the bank could have a precedent.
In line with the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states buy the respective shares of the bank at about 49 percent.
The bank is likely to sell part of its holdings, primarily the insurance activities purchased by Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The shares of Fortis started a steep descent last week, and in the second half of the week serious crisis scenarios were already emerging.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with its 85,000 employees, is far too big for a crash.
The Institute’s securities fell 12% to a 14-year low on Friday.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
In view of the current share prices, the market value of the group amounts to EUR 14 billion, which, according to the management, is unrealistic.
According to the management, the $700 billion American bailout package and the resulting uncertainty in the markets is due to the downfall of Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, the courses increased slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed the new Director General of the Bank.
The financial institution was also looking for a private buyer, but no interested person found himself with a factual offer.
The Belgian government, on the other hand, was concerned about reassurance - no investor should tremble for his money, it said.
No panic has erupted among customers so far, the bank’s branches have not been stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent branches, but it also calls leasing companies its own.
Fox in the chicken stall
Because of a person’s drug use, life and health insurance companies in America often refuse to sign a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of the drug data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we trust the fox with the chickens" - quoted Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for tracking prescription data.
Insurance companies determine the fees as well as the amounts paid in the event of damage depending on the state of the customer’s health, and should the risk be overestimated, the insurance is not even completed at all.
In the past, the customer was sent for a medical examination, and the contract was concluded only with knowledge of the results of the examination.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper method: Using the customer’s identification number, he obtains the data from the pharmacies for the last one and a half years, that is, which preparations were bought, and the program calculates from it which disease the customer suffers and what his health condition is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it could be concluded that his blood fat level is untreatable, which would automatically put him in a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so that the insurance companies only have to do more paperwork, but there are minor difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many medications can be taken for various purposes, such as against migraines and hot flashes, but also against depression.
From the point of view of insurers, the latter is a high-risk factor, while the aforementioned are not.
For the query and processing of the data, own companies have formed, which, before obtaining the data, ask the patient for his consent.
In the meantime, they have to do so by law, although omissions have not yet been sanctioned.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory tests and connect them to the data on drug consumption, providing an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to the data, and controlling its use is becoming more difficult at the same time.
Although there is an own data protection law for health data, its effect extends only to health service providers and insurance companies.
The bill has already been presented to Congress, according to which the authorities could also control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard sees that this is too little, so he wants to further develop his program, so that the data can only be passed on with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question, of course, is that the person concerned can hardly prohibit access to his data, since the insurance companies otherwise do not enter into a contract with him.
And so the chickens are somehow left to the mercy of the fox.
Global food plan from Marseille
European Union and India double trade
Since the European Union and India are leading trading partners of each other on both sides, this was the main topic among other global problems at the ninth summit.
Today, the Franco-Indian Summit is also taking place, mainly discussing cooperation in the nuclear energy sector.
While the European Union recognizes that India is an emerging, democratic major power that should be given more voices and complicity in international affairs, the member states have not yet reached an agreement on whether or not to support the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was not discussed at yesterday’s ninth summit in Marseille.
The French President and current EU Council President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana, welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement has been reached to double trade over the next five years, i.e. to raise it to a good 100 billion euros.
Given that the exchange of goods between 2000 and 2007 had increased from 25 to 55 billion, this goal is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India were also legally combined into an agreement, so that air traffic will also be stimulated in the future.
By 2009, India wants to sign the free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The aim is to strike a balance in the currently unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: while the Union is the number one partner in India, New Delhi ranks only in ninth place among EU partners.
The summit was dedicated to global concerns.
This included the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, which both sides strongly condemned, and the call for a UN conference was also called for.
The Doha round should also be completed, with both sides to blame for the failure.
The EU stressed that it is sticking to its energy and climate programme, which means that pollutant emissions should be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
India agreed to this, as did the proposal to close a kind of global compromise at the upcoming climate summit and reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
The rise in food prices should also be combated, so both support the convening of an international conference on the financial crisis.
The head of government of India is visiting the French capital today, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, orders to French companies worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India are hoped.
According to agency reports, the agreement is to be adopted for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th Book Fair, the most important international event for the acquisition of rights.
The international Frankfurt Book Fair is expecting more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries for the current event. They will spread over the 171,790 square meters of the fair and present over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the honorary guest of the event.
The undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Property and Cultural Activities Maria Giro will represent the Italian government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented by the 264 m2 exhibition space “Punto Italia”.
This will be followed by a press conference near the Room Structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: on this occasion, figures, trends and perspectives on publishing in Italy will be discussed.
According to the data, the importance of the books of foreign writers decreases throughout, especially in the adult and youth sectors.
The missing small plane of billionaire Steve Fossett recovered a year ago
The small plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared on a flight over the desert of Nevada on September 3, 2007, was found.
The items have been found on a 3000 m high plateau, in the area of the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the states of California and Nevada.
However, there were no human remains inside the aircraft.
The sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, fully refuted the last doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been localized, to which a troop has been dispatched. Now we have the certainty that it is the plane with which Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found on the plane or its vicinity.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Department of Transportation (Ntsb) noted that just hours after the aircraft was sighted, a crew was sent out to identify the aircraft: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on September 3, 2007, after Fossett had started a 3-hour flight in Yerrington, Nevada.
Yesterday, too, some of Fossett's personal belongings were found in California, near the Nevada border, by a couple near her home on the Mammoth Lakes.
These are two cards called Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned a month after its disappearance.
The billionaire had taken a place in history through a long succession of records.
In 2002, he was the first person to circumnavigate the world ball in a hot air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world in a single flight without a stopover by an airplane.
Its many records also include an altitude flight of 15445 m above the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A SUV that falls out of the traditional schemes due to its original design and the special line-up, the exuberant surface and its clear angles.
With this off-roader, Mercedes-Benz has tried to breathe new breath into the sector.
Especially because of its exceptional features, the presentation of the Suv Glk will also be unconventional, which will be shown in the showroom of Mercedes-Benz from October 17th.
Thus, the advertising drum that will accompany the appearance of the new model will also appear in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a novelty in the automotive sector in backward Italy.
A project with a maximum effort to be carried out in various phases, which will take the central shopping mile of Milan, the Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in form, with 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como to give the whole a special look: the new SUV will thus appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will emerge so seemingly from the poster on which it is depicted.
The Elumina8 technology illuminates the new glk in all its details at different moments in order to reassemble it as a whole.
Without a doubt, Mercedes’s concern with this advertisement is to introduce a new type of auto advertising into this rather stereotypical field.
But will it succeed in attracting the interest of future buyers? We will see.
Now it is clear who the Italian hooligans are
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk stadium ban
Who are these 150-200 boys and girls, for whom the whole of Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been behind the Italian national team for years and which, frankly, until recently did not cause any serious problems.
Never before have there been clashes with enemy fans.
The origin of the group lies in the right environment.
The sponsors come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
Other smaller groups from Campania and Apulia joined in Sofia.
They wear the tricolori, on which the cities of the militants appear: however, these were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Her role models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, a truly radical right-wing fan scene, that of Levski, has now come to an end.
The Figc had provided the Italian fans with 144 cards for the game: all were issued on names and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were all controlled by the Viminal: among those who travelled to Sofia there was no one with an ongoing stadium ban procedure.
Four fans of the Italian team, who were already preloaded in this regard, were thus also denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to initiate further steps: in this case, the Tifosi arrested or identified in the riots can expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to the stadiums across Europe.
Our hooligans will no longer set foot in a stadium.
Good luck.
But now, of course, there is fear of counterfeiters who could follow them little more than 150.
“This fire must be extinguished immediately, and that in no way gives such behavior the opportunity to justify it,” the Viminal said.
Therefore, "eyes on above all also with a view to the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
Because there is actually a small core of the Italian ultras in Apulia.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio (Sports Supervision) gathers on Tuesday the Casms, which can count on part of the Aise, i.e. the intelligence services that deal with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce calls and the raised right arm during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria, this is not a crime..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (clearly expressed in joyless terms) who has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the post of Francesco Tagliente and Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously, Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where now a core of the supporters of the Ultras Italia founded in 2002 comes from.
It is true, Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duce, but undoubtedly the behavior of these 150-200 people was a disgrace.
“I am not a sociologist – add the No. 1 of the Osservatorio – crimes are prosecuted in the country of their action.
So far, this group had been in the lurch, but now it has to be considered what has happened and will happen.
But we also talk about the pipes during the hymn Mamelis: even this is not a crime, but they allow me, because there is no education...".
