28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old cook, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall.
The victim's brother said that he can't imagine anyone wanting to harm him, "Finally, he went up again."
The body found in the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the San Francisco Medical Department said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was classified as murder and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the ABS station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a cook in Boston, had his dream job as a cook at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were “shocked and destroyed on the ground.”
“We’re a small team that works like a close family and we’re going to miss it painfully,” the spokesman said.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank’s family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank initially lived in hostels, but that, "things finally went up for him."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he could not imagine anyone wanting to harm his younger brother.
He was a friendly person with a big heart.
His way of connecting with his family was to always cook us something, prepare us dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of dispute.
He was the brother who swam with the stream.
"In everything that goes wrong in the world, he was that uncut diamond that lit brightly every day," he said.
Anyone who has information about the case is asked to call the SFPD’s telephone number at 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always put in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn’t always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood star made this clear in an interview.
"I'm always put in drawers or get glued on from outside labels that usually have little to do with me and reality."
“I don’t have the desire to always be perfect and successful.”
“To be honest, I’m more concerned about these things.”
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh at her being considered “Miss Perfect,” as she explains in the current “Cosmopolitan.”
The actress prefers to spend her time at home, in front of television with loose dutch and Mexican food, according to the magazine.
“We women don’t have to be married or have children to be perfect,” the Hollywood star said.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is not a children's game", Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film will run with us from August 25th.
Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues were looking for a bit of variety with a ride on the beach.
For the 58-year-old, it was a premiere.
CHIO: "Golden Sport Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes the horses remembered their evening of work, they chased home to the feeding troughs in the fast gallop.
A mile at this pace, I was scared.
“It wasn’t a good experience,” Langer says.
And that ended the riding career again.
On Saturday, Germany’s best golfer of all time – 101 tournament victories – was back near horses.
He and his family were guided by the ALRV, and he did not even swing on a horse for photo purposes.
Longer was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports aid gave the man from Anhausen the Golden Sport Pyramid as part of a small gala.
There is no shortage of awards for the sympathetic athlete.
Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has already knighted him.
Longer is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
“This award means a lot to me,” says Langer, “because it is awarded not only for sporting successes but also for social engagement.”
For decades, Langer has been promoting young people.
And so he also passed on the prize money of 25,000 euros immediately.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time U.S. champion was inducted into the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.
Among the winners are the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the Fechter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-Fahrer Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the Springreiter Alwin Schockemöhle and posthum der Handballer.
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious society migrated to the Spring Stadium, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept his distance from the big animals.
Clinton and Trump’s economic policy: It’s all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade deal – both Clinton and Trump want that.
However, the two US presidential candidates disagree on tax and energy policy as well as on a fundamental issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The one about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns of how the state can harm the economy – with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He himself would be completely different, Trump claims.
He will push back regulations massively, and he is committed to far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates – for private individuals and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says the state has certain tasks to perform, it has opportunities to open up disadvantaged people, and it needs money to do so.
That is why taxes would be increased for the rich, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.
“We need to invest in them,” Trump and Clinton said in a statement.
The Democratic candidate even announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.
State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected, for example, by the state-critical tea party wing of Republicans.
So there could be party-internal discussions on Trump.
The differences in energy and climate policy are more clear.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and raise coal production in the United States.
Oil production is also expected to be possible in protected areas, and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change is expected to be terminated.
Clinton, on the other hand, explicitly wants to expand renewable energy with her investment program and demands: “A country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs.”
“It will probably be either China, Germany or America – I want it to be us.”
But not only in terms of infrastructure – even in the case of international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.
TPP, the trans-Pacific trade agreement, does not want to sign both.
At the same time, both of them do not want to isolate the U.S. from international trade – but simply better protect American jobs.
They should also be paid better, says Clinton.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.
He wants to raise it to $15 an hour.
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not quite clear: once he says: The minimum wage must be up, then he says he must not be changed.
However, the big discussion of the coming months is likely to develop more about the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, Trump wants to relieve the economy and the citizens in order to boost growth.
His critics prefer him so that the budget deficit would only be greater.
On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants the rich to demand that they pay more taxes, and whose critics say that more taxes are not the solution either.
Escape: “Every refugee woman has experience with sexual violence”
Sexual violence is almost part of everyday life for women who flee alone.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers shelter.
There are four women in a large kitchen.
Everyone has a baby who is at most one year old.
One of them put her little son in her arms.
He looks with great eyes curiously into the room.
His mother stares at the tabletop.
Until she realizes she’s being watched.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.
The scene seems normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the division manager of Condrobs, a provider of social assistance services in Bavaria, and deals with, among other things, the topic of women fleeing.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodations for single women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women’s Aid.
It has recently been officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men, not even as visitors.
The exception is a guard at the door.
“It’s not overstated to say that every woman who arrives here has experienced sexual violence on her escape,” Bahr says.
“Men flee because of wars because they are politically persecuted because of the threat of torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as hope carriers,” she says.
In women, other reasons for the escape outweigh: "Many steal secretly from it because they see no other way out".
In their home country, they have had experience with sexual violence, forced marriage, honor killings, slavery or forced prostitution.
That drives her away.
On the run, it goes on.
“The fact that tugs, for example, demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a rarity,” Bahr says.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Anyone who believes that this will end as soon as they arrive in Germany is mistaken, Bahr says.
Here too, single women in refugee shelters would often be considered inferior and worst-case abuse.
As a result, about 90 percent of the women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized, she estimates.
"Some of the children are certainly not born voluntarily".
Many women are so used to it that they don’t say anything.
"Or they don't dare to speak openly about the experience because the shame is too great".
Since they often don’t know how to help, they need more accommodation just for them, Bahr demands.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees.
When asked if they knew of a similar project as in Munich in their area of responsibility, some responded with no.
In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in the accommodations of the governments.
Even in Swabia, refugee women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, the government’s press spokesman.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia, some community accommodations have floors or houses of their own for single women and their children only.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The European Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.
In a study published for the committee, it says: "It is very important that men and women are housed separately."
"Feeling privacy or being men and women housed together can lead to - ongoing - violence against women".
In particular, the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible for women, according to the study.
How much women feel about this need for protection can be seen in the spirit that exists at the house in Munich.
“Since we’ve talked about it, we’ve got a long waiting list,” Bahr says.
You could easily open a second house.
Assistant Doctors Strike: Demands for New Workforce Measures
Representatives of the assistant doctors have called on their union to approve new labour force measures in their disputes regarding a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has asked its entire council to approve more work-fighting measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC said it had failed ministers to address concerns about the treaty.
In July, assistant doctors and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract that was agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC chairman Ellen McCourt said the government had remained “persistently quiet” about problems, leading to the rejection of the treaty.
She said: "In view of this, the JDC board has voted to reject the proposed new contract completely and to request official renegotiations to all your concerns."
In response to the government’s silence, the JDC Executive Board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating work-fighting measures beginning at the beginning of September.
The disputes led to assistant doctors striking six times this year, the first total failures in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA assistant doctors Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed terms and conditions recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings, which took place before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students, that the contract was beneficial and should be accepted.
After the vote, Secretary of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would be enforced.
Russia and Turkey: An "Alliance of Outsiders"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish opponent in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Putin’s smile was slimy and he barely radiated heat, even for his restrained conditions.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "loving friend" Putin - five times, according to a report.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
His enthusiasm seemed to me to be the opposite.
But a long-lasting cool radiating from Putin showed that the head of state of Russia had not forgotten anything.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting down of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moscow’s reaction at the time was infuriated.
Putin handed out and accused Ankara of falling in the back of Russia.
The offense was even greater, as it was committed by an alleged friend.
Rebuilding the trust will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
At one point, it seemed like the Turks were to blame for everything.
Most serious were allegations by senior officials that Erdogan’s own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He denied this vehemently.
But in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia was able to win some sort of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he was almost stripped of his office last month in a failed coup d'état.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed.
They count on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean Sea.
This week, state television forecasts cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed back.
A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "Tourists there long, tomatoes long here."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West because it considers its response to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.
In addition, there is a continuing grudge about the sluggish pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian head of state certainly won a bonus in Ankara for calling for support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup.
This is well-known for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.
The summit meeting in this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey, as an analyst once described to me, to represent "the alliance of outsiders": two countries that feel displaced and ill-treated from the West and now ally themselves.
Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently took on the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents at the press conference said they hadn’t even stripped the issue.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where to find a common denominator on Syria.
But after months of open hostilities – and given the potential for a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet – it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk again.
Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available to customers outside Scotland
According to the CEO of the bank, the RBS brand should only be reduced to a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s global ambitions.
The bank has distanced itself since when it almost collapsed and had to be saved eight years ago.
During this time, brand strategists "RBS" have used it to protect other end-user financial brands.
She supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to put more national brands in focus.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralized head office and the stock exchange listing will switch to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for the retail business that will get more importance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we are now becoming more of a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I now say that we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the perceptibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
“It’s time for us to develop into the bank of brands, because how do we focus internally (we asked) on making this a better bank for customers?” said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would have been a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think, you will see many changes.
We can relaunch these brands, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori wins 3,000th on Newmarket
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket, which brings him 3,000th profit
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He set a milestone on prediction, which is trained by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
Three-time winner Dettori, who previously won on Ghayyar, said, "It's something special."
I am very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
Dettori picks up the cheer as he wins on prediction
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race – Jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby winner, had 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modernity and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charisma have been inspiring fans for this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have won 6,000 if he wasn’t just a weekend and big tournament jockey!
Frankie has been riding in GB for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a vibrant personality, which is good for a British race, but in addition, he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nerve-wracking.
A whole series of big tournament wins, including his famous "Glorious Sevens" in 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, he initially had trouble returning from his six-month lockdown, but he showed an impressive character strength to defy his doubters and return to his best form.
And he’s not over yet – Dettori once said that he wants to go on in competitions until he’s at least 50 years old.
Russia's Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly released his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was for many years part of Putin’s closest circle of trust.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.
In a statement issued by the Kremlin, Putin “ordered the dismissal of Ivanov from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration without giving any reason.”
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov’s deputy since 2012, was appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, Estonia in 1972, he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
The Kremlin website says (in Russian) that he was later the head of protocol and chief of staff of government personnel.
Speaking about his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think that the government’s most important task is to support your role as Head of State in drafting and implementing your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Convince the smiling faces?
This move has made Moscow a mystery.
For a long time, Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin’s closest confidants and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which aired on television, both men claimed that the chief of staff resigned at his own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, few are convinced here - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that at the moment.
But the official claim — that a man who was once praised as a potential president wants to lead Russian environmental policy at once — came across great skepticism.
In his remarks to Putin quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said "it's true that I asked you in early 2012 in a conversation to entrust me with this very complicated post - one could almost say - difficult post for four years.
As it turns out, I have been president of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov accepted the post in December 2011.
Prior to that, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), replacing the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of five people he trusted the most.
It was once believed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin’s second term, as a third term of Putin would have violated the Constitution.
But this post was taken by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after beating producers
Gibson was involved in a physical confrontation last month on the set of the series in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced its termination in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, publicly apologized on Thursday before announcing his resignation.
On the set there were artistic differences and a difference of opinion.
I regret the incident," he said in a statement.
Details on how Gibson’s character from the series, which follows a team of FBI agents, is expected to be released at a later date, according to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously played in the sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been there since the first season of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have spent the last 12 years putting my whole heart in it," Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that will no longer be possible.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and, above all, the best fans you can only wish for a series.
The planned broadcast of the twelfth season is scheduled for September 28.
Mysteries of Fish Who Landed in Garden in Banff
A resident of Banff requested assistance in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sandals spewed out by a fountain.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published a video of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch-long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
<0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct – which means the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "deck blower" that approach the completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slanted sails.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017.
Economic Minister Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to cross the bridge from the country.
He said, “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses to an engineering art of a truly epic measure in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the fit.
In total, almost 79% of the entire bridge decks are in their place and the last section of the deck is now getting a concrete casting for the deck in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be raised on the bridge in its place.
Michael Martin, Project Manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first closure represents a significant milestone in any bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents future-oriented construction and civil engineering.
After installing the last road deck section and connecting it to the north tower deck under construction, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north or land side.
This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massive, since the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3%.
Heikel, since the tolerances the team is working on were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three Men Have “Happiness Still to Be Alive”
Three men have “happiness to be alive” after being thrown off Anglesey by their fishing boat.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station struck an alarm at 13:20 BST on Friday after a crew watched the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming safely, while their boat continued to move with its own strength.
“We saw the boat turning around near her and imagined the worst,” said Moelfre Vince Jones, head of the rescue station.
“Luckily, the strong winds have already swept the boat out of its reach until we let it water,” he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging on a buoy without a life jacket.
They all got on board the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said: “The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky to be unharmed and still alive.
Although the boat engine had an emergency stop line, it disengaged from the person who controlled the boat when the boat was Kenting.
Someone was watching over these men today.
seriously injured - man stabs his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured her.
As police said yesterday, the 50-year-old had been given the key to the apartment to pick up his personal belongings.
Instead, the alcoholic cut off the clothes of his ex-girlfriend.
When she came to the apartment, he stabbed her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured in the hand and body.
Police were able to arrest the offender.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
He then alerted his sister.
Together with her life partner, the 45-year-old wanted to reassure her brother.
But she couldn't get him to leave the apartment.
That’s why she left the house with her partner.
On the road they met the man's ex-life companion.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds cheap apartments in Braunschweig?
The SPD and Greens believe that investors should be much more involved in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1,300 cheap apartments in the next few years?
The SPD proposes a "living action concept" for the next Council meeting.
The dispute is programmed.
First of all, the question is: who is going to build the cheap apartments?
There has been a lack of regulation so far.
SPD Group Chairman Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the Greens: If you want to build on urban areas, you have to designate 20 percent of all apartments as social apartments in the future."
However, the cheap apartments can also be created in stock.
Bratmann said, “How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?”
“We want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but as much as 20 percent of the homes as possible as social housing.”
A new urban housing promotion program, which will cost millions and still need to be funded, is supposed to provide incentives.
The problem, Bratmann said, "There is no agreement between the factions at the moment."
The CDU wants to make investors as few regulations as possible.
The Left wants tough conditions for investors.
Despite this, Bratmann said, the situation in the housing market is intensifying.
If the concept of action is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the construction administration.
More staff is needed.
It is unclear if we will get the professionals.
But the program is not yet complete: because the around 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.
But how do you compensate for the loss of around 1,300 more affordable apartments, the funding of which will expire in the next few years?
By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.
To prevent this, according to planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm, outgoing ties should now be bought by the city.
In addition, consideration should be given to getting apartments back into the price bracket.
This is possible in the West City.
In one stroke, the problem could be solved.
In the West City, deadlines expire at the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be brought back there in the price binding for cheap apartments.
Only: the owners, the housing companies do not want that.
After all, the number of social housing in the West City is drastically increased again, away from the goal of so-called mixing.
There should be no more concentration of social security in just a few districts.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.
Holger Herlitschke, chairman of the group, said: "For a broad majority, the CDU has to get on board."
It has focused on more construction sites for single-family homes.
But that doesn’t mean we can’t find a compromise.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their free time staring at screens, has been lamented by many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the couch and getting more active.
The time on the screen was initially limited to television, then to video games and lastly to smartphones.
Therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
I refer, of course, to Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters first created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs were created).
Like many phenomena of pop culture, interest dropped slightly before the release of the game in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The market launch in other countries was postponed due to the massive demand that overloaded the servers.
Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and, once found, can be “photographed” (via a screenshot on their phone) or “captured”.
A generation who played the game when she was even younger joined the madness and jumped for the search from the sofa.
In the United States, the game led to a significant increase in steps that the “average” person takes every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game’s launch, the number of people who train 30 minutes a day rose from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn’t know who is playing Pokémon Go – it just sees the raw data to increase performance.
Many public health awareness campaigns that want people to “take 30 minutes,” “come from the sofa,” and “be active every day” hit deaf ears because many public health messages are boring and come from people who look miserable.
However, the importance of sport cannot be overstated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical exercise helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that are too long to list here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something outdoors that makes them fun.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even make new friendships on the hunt.
As always, there are also gruesome game spoilers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could walk against a door.
What's the matter?
There has been a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they didn’t give us any reason to do sports like this game does.
The new will lose its appeal and its use will diminish over time.
However, due to Pokemon’s success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with becoming active in the real world, helping many people hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles makes gold in women's tournaments
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the jump horse.
Easy on the bar.
Breathtaking on the ground.
All in all brilliant.
And now, at last, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast rose to the title of multi-combat on Thursday, widening the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of everyone under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.
Their overall result of 62,198 was clearly ahead of silver medal winner and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medal winner Alyya Mustafina.
American women Simone Biles toured on the swing bar during the women's single multi-game final in the Art Tournament at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American to win a multi-combat title and the fifth overall, as she solidifies her reputation of being the best of her generation or even ever.
She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey came to an end at that moment.
This success puts her in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who has brought her sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 world championship medals—including 10 gold medals—with such amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton said of her that she is “the best gymnast I’ve ever seen.”
She expected a final exam in Brazil, a competition that didn’t go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.
Not returning to the family in Spring, Texas with a handful of gold would be considered a disappointment.
American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the women's single multi-game final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles picked up the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as the exclamation mark at the farewell ceremony of the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted on never having planned the future during her long journey to the top, this is not really true.
Part of their ground exercises – which include their typical tumbling pass – is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the road outside the Olympic Arena in Rio.
That's not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gym where Boorman trained, became a force.
She has not lost a multi-combat competition since the summer of 2013, a winning series that will last as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafina led through two turns easily, the picture was deceptive.
Floating beams and floor turns - in which Biles holds the world title - lurched.
She picked up again with 15,433 on the swing bar - and put another one on the floor with a 15,933.
Raisman gently embraced her as they expected her endearment—a pure formality—and tears poured on Bile’s shiny red, white, and blue eyeliner as the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality.
Raisman's performance was a revenge for the last time she fought for third place four years ago, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tie-brake.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, who is called "Oma" by the Americans, had a head start.
After her ground practice, she threw kissing hands at the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed doubtful.
As far as Biles is concerned, the quick-spreading tweet of the 19-year-olds from earlier this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims killed in serial murder while listening to music in car
According to police reports released on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the deadliest attacks in a decade in Phoenix’s first serial murder case while talking in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12 while the car was parked in an entrance, authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle, can be read in the report.
Police said the triple murder did not appear to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 held by one of the adult victims.
Phoenix Police spokesman Jonathan Howard said the shooting prompted investigators to take a closer look at whether it is linked to four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks within four months, mostly in Hispanic residential areas.
"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," Howard told KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah still died on the spot.
A witness told police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also released a police report on the shooting, which aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the three-time murder and is assumed to be the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It gets better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and of course his mother.
But like most of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can't do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't get involved in that.
What's not right at all -- of course, you've got to get involved," she said.
Her husband Vincent and her were told that Edmund may never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest institutionalizing him.
"My first response was 'I didn't know people were still doing it,'" Picciuto said.
Edmund can walk with the help of a walking aid.
Edmund could neither sit nor crawl until his third year of life and he still can’t speak.
But he is slowly making progress.
He can run with support and cycling.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund thought of "Please sing me something before."
"We teach him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some signs alone.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic as in Edmund, as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the Zika virus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and prognoses can vary greatly.
It is still too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I kept asking, what will happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven’t asked for the forecast for a long time, because I don’t expect it to really tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
It's getting better.
You know it will get better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains, floods give rise to rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to call out the emergency on Friday, with more rainfall expected throughout Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi flooded their shores and threatened large-scale flooding following extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service reported.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and that assistance to affected communities is already on the way.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags were increasing.
Steele said that the municipality of Tangipahoa alone had requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
A flood warning system is used across large parts in southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service stated that an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.
A flood early warning system was used in southern Alabama on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The River Comite near Baton Rouge and the River Amite near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.
Meterologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many homes in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish poses a danger, as it will only flow slowly across the stepped rivers into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescue teams still tapped people from floodwaters in the Amite and Wilkinson districts of southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued on Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet from his home, rose sharply overnight.
He said another step-son who lives nearby would have warned him.
“We woke up and the water flowed and flowed in,” Hansford said.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that she had never seen such a high altitude of the river in the 48 years she lived there.
Hansford said he and his family members had all disabilities and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that emergency workers had saved all three in a large military truck and had taken them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were housed until Friday.
Krautmann said the flooding had "spread rapidly" as there were still heavy rainfalls and that authorities were considering evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches of rain.
Krautmann said the ground had been considerably engulfed by the rains since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rains and floods caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and school dropouts in five school districts.
CBS subsidiary WWL reported that a deputy in Tangipahoa reported 200 flooded homes.
The inhabitants were evacuated in two churches, both of which were now flooded.
Robby Miller, the head of the community, said the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets washed up by the flood.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency shelters were set up to accommodate the evacuees.
“As soon as the water starts to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes,” he said.
In the city of Hammond, the municipality of Tangipahoa, almost two dozen streets were closed due to the flood and sandbags were provided for the residents to take with them, who hope to keep the water out of their homes and shops.
“The last major flood we had was in March,” said Lacy Landrum of the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast.
According to his data, a handful of houses were reported to have been flooded on Thursday, but none have been reported so far.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "holed by bullets," survives shooting in Philadelphia
Police say the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week, the second time a 6-year-old child has been shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
The grandparents stated that Brown suffered several gunshot injuries, including in the lumbar, leg, arm, and abdomen, but that he was conscious of being transported to the hospital.
"He went through a lot, his little body was pierced by bullets," his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy’s condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several surgeries.
The boy’s family told the station that he is expected to recover.
He should have started the first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old, who is in a critical condition, the broadcaster reports.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are currently investigating whether one of the injured men could be among the perpetrators.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there was apparently a crossfire between several shooters.
Cartridge sleeves for assault rifles traced back to various assault rifles oversaw the crime scene.
It seems that this was clearly a continuing struggle.
On the street, on both sides of the walkway, there were sleeves.
So there seem to have been several armed fighters here who were very actively involved," police skinman Anthony Ginaldi told the Philadelphia police station.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
There were no arrests and police are currently reviewing the surveillance video, according to reports.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a crossbutton on her arm while playing in front of her house in the residential area of West Oak Lane.
She recovers and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That’s what I imagine under the women’s Olympic team in gymnastics and for more than one reason.
First, I have been at every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team has three female coaches, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have been inspiring for many young girls of different skin color.
The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one female gymnast was an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
This shows strength.
At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected, yet masterful, gymatic routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth straight American to win gold at an individual multi-fight event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We experience the top of this sport, but that’s not how gym classes all over the country look like.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same route as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.
They are the "last five" because the next Olympic team will have only four female athletes in the team, and this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as coach.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and Turner is primarily held in private gyms maintained by parents who pay for the training, furnishing, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the coaches and their coaches and families).
The majority of these clubs are located in affluent suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs, the Turners receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, both have been training their athletes since they started training.
We must enable the communities of countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie to provide a more affordable and easily accessible gym.
I founded my 20-year gymnast.
At my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will be expanding to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality youth gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.
It’s the inspiration of this team that gets thousands of young girls interested in gymnastics and that’s great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic team gold and thank you, grab so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way of becoming healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistant Doctors Want to Organize Further Strikes After Rejecting Jeremy Hunt's Proposal
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted in an election rejected him.
In July, Hunt had unveiled plans to impose the treaty forcibly, saying that the NHS was in a “no-man’s-land” and any further delay would be detrimental to employees and patients.
The first assistant doctors are to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at unsightly times.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Committee on Assistant Physicians, said in a statement last night: "Assistance physicians have still serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and neglect to treat all doctors fairly."
With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress needs to be made and the time runs out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve disputes through talks met with the government to participate in reluctance and sometimes with deafening silence.
That was a promise Jeremy Hunt made just last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift up the force and address the concerns of assistant doctors".
If he does not, the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work-fighting measures.
The last strike at the end of April saw a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialists were included to provide cover to doctors on the strike chain.
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekly salary for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, director-general of NHS employees, called on the assistant doctors to end the strike.
Mortimer said: “Working combat measures do not achieve anything of the few, but burden already overloaded teams and service providers and only cause concern, distress and interruption for patients, caregivers and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Assistant Doctors and responded positively to the concerns about guardianship and whistleblowing with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.
Employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a professional break, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, continuing education leave and gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious the employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health were in May to comply with the agreements with the May, the February, and the February, the February, the February, the February, the May, the May, the May, the May, the May, and the May, the May, the May, the May, the May, the May, the May, the May, the May, the May, the May, the May, and the May, the May, the May, the May, the issue of the issue of the issue of the issue of the issue of the issue of the Commission.
The <0xC2><0xA3>2-per day drug that can lower heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a <0xC2><0xA3>2 per day drug after the authorities have recommended that more people administer it for an extended period of time.
The anticoagulant drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NHS’ NICE regulator has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS’ NICE regulator has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year, and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the artery walls that form coverings.
When the lining breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that clogs the blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
When the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and clog the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.
NICE’s guidance draft, released today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg of ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Center, said: “Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke – often with disastrous consequences.”
Fear of a new heart attack can have significant negative effects on a person’s quality of life.
Experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years.
Political Correctness Culture Blows Up Election Fraud in Muslim Areas
Former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year on the occasion of a government report on corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread election fraud knowingly being ignored in Muslim communities, as a devastating government report revealed today.
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers, and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse due to “hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion.”
The former Minister of Integration and Local Government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said the intimidation of voters for religious reasons would be so bad that police should be allowed to set up lockdown bands outside poll booths to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters carry an ID with them to prove their identity in elections.
At the moment, a voter just has to name and address his or her name.
The report suggests applying non-removable ink to a person’s finger when giving their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Whistleblowers should be given more protection, says Sir Eric.
He calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions from non-official committees or working groups.
“This not only serves against election fraud, but is also intended to protect the municipal government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes along with it,” he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets electoral scandal in east London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the incumbent mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had cynically perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community and that he had silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia accusations.
Rahman is said to have "led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to elect him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of an imitation in which one person chooses as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed himself in particular alarmingly at the fraudulent letter election – in which older members of the Muslim community had pressured people to elect a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including driving IDs to prove identity
His report states: "As evidence it was appropriate to put pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elderly, especially communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
"There were concerns that... state institutions would have deliberately ignored such behavior due to "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric issued 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from editing letter-election documents to stop "hidden" people.
The report, which is considered by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral register from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters for your ID before choosing.
Use non-removable ink on a person’s finger as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Conduct systematic reviews of a person’s nationality to ensure that they are eligible for election.
A three-year limitation on requests for an automatic letter selection.
Prohibition that political activists process full letter elections and envelopes of letter elections.
The police have the authority to set up lockdowns for polling stations.
A legislative amendment facilitating an indictment of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983 (Volksvertretungsgesetz 1983).
Photography ban in polling stations.
Requirement that only English may be used in the polling stations (except Wales).
Intensification of training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go to the polling booth alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that no criminal charges were filed after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The Electoral Court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy unfit for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
He was found guilty due to a number of reasons for sufficient - according to the high demands of criminal proceedings -.
He also criticizes the ineffective "checks" of the election registration departments of the town hall.
Sir Eric said: “The court ruling in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
As the mother of parliaments, our country has a proud heritage, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial by some authorities threaten this good reputation.
Crazy for Kate's biker doubles and other famous doubles of Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio have come out this week over the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proven to be an impressive doppelganger of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But this summer, the 24-year-old Olympionikin is by far not the only gold-fighting athlete to have his own famous doppelganger - at least not if one is allowed to believe in social media.
In honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are currently flickering on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympics that have more than a certain resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
The Hunter and the Wolf: Team member of the U.S. team in archery Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood
In addition to Kate’s double on the racetrack, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain archer might be the twin of A-promi Leonardo DiCaprio.
The team member of the U.S. team in archery Brady Ellison has caused an onslaught on Twitter after images he sees uncannyly similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star surfaced.
In fact, the archer got the madness on social media and admitted that since his childhood, he has been hearing that he looks like Leo.
"I don't see much similarity myself, except for facial hair," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess I'll take that as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly become even more central this year: the increasing similarity between British wide jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her big, expressive eyes is said to be able to pass through as a doppelganger for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared for years to Glee star Matthew Morrison.
A walk higher: This user believes that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception actor
Another persistent comparison was drawn between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medal swimmer Yulia Efimova has more than just sun-tanned skin and blonde hair like actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian was attested by fans to equal an "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong women: football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the similarities as well
Theory put into the room: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similarity of the couple
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are nearly identical."
In fact, American football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medalist in the tournament Gabby Douglas, which has her own beautiful, broad smile similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator on the Olympic Games apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmer "has died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at dr 4x200m freestyle swimming relay outraged viewers of the CBC live broadcast of the Olmypian Games on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologize after one of its commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer “went off like Mief” and died during the race like “a pig”.
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle swimming pool.
MacDonald, who had been brought on board the CBS commentary team to give more “color,” could be heard saying, “This little 14-year-old Chinese woman has lost her connection, baby.”
Too excited, went off like Mief, died like a pig.
Thanks for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing Canadians to unlock the gap to China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the sound and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Has the CBC commentator just said that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "has died like a pig"????
The idiot didn't know they were still on the show."
Ai Yanhan from China was described at the final 4 x 200m freestyle swimming relay for women as follows: "This little 14-year-old Chinese woman has lost the connection, baby."
Criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, where many spoke to him.
Twitter users didn’t hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists.
A short time later, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC broadcast, apologized live for MacDonald's comment, saying, "We apologize for the comment being broadcast about a swimming performance."
It was an unfortunately chosen wording, we are sorry it happened."
CBC apologized over 90 times to people who responded to the comment on Twitter
Commentary colleague Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added its apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald’s comments
The network also apologized quickly and issued a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that it has been made possible for them to be broadcast.
Last night, we quickly apologized to our viewers on the show and to our followers on social media.
To clarify one thing, Byron’s comments related to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.
Still, they were inappropriate and an unfortunately chosen wording, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on the show and tried to justify his comment by stating that it was not his intention that it be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I'd like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swimming relay on the CBC Olympic program," he said.
"I referred to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."
Of course, no disrespect was intended and I am very sorry."
Buyers in Primark outraged over woman trying shameless underwear in the middle of the store
Buyers didn’t know where to look when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a Primark to try on underwear.
To make the situation worse, she mustered, as she looked in it, pulled it out and put it back on the shelf.
She continued to browse and tried four pairs of underwear in a shop at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.
The Primark shop at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone, where the woman tried the underwear before putting it back in the shelf
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried on the underwear, "she got back on and left the store without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the sales floor, she took a pair of underpants out of the display, pulled out her own pantyhose and pants and tried them on.
"She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, cheeky like Oskar."
"Everyone was staring at her as she pulled out the underpants again, which obviously didn't please her, as she put them back on the shelf."
She repeated the same thing with three more underpants before she finally decided that she didn’t like anything, got back on and went out.
“She didn’t seem to bother that she was watching someone — or thinking about the person who might be buying the underwear she had tried on.”
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "How disgusting to think that someone would take underwear home with them that had a different person and that was not washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "As I have noticed, the employees have tried to pull the garments out of the sale after she left - which is just as good."
"I would hate to go home with a new pair of underwear and find out that another woman was hooking her up and pulling her out again and not washing her."
A spokesperson for Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday, August 9 at our branch in Folkstone."
All eligible products were withdrawn from the sale.
How to Protect Yourself from Weapons Attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether you approach you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the spear for your robber.
As you approach from behind, you should turn around first, so you can see your attacker and “get out of the line of fire,” Mizrachi says.
Then grab the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow in the face.
Then, hit him with your knee in the bar and twist while the attacker bends down in pain, knocking the weapon out of his hands. Hit him with the run in the face and move backwards as they point the weapon at him.
For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body from the firing line, grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot.
At the same time, lower the weight on the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon out of his handle before moving backwards and pointing the weapon at him.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi is doing.
But keep in mind that in a robbery, it’s safest to hand over your money – unless you’re a Krav Maga grandmaster.
Traveler Ian Wright shaves his tongue in the dirtiest places in Europe for a guide
A British traveller underwent a serious examination of his immune system and squealing reflex - licking some of Europe's dirtiest and most disgusting places.
The presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk created his moves on a Euro bill, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing button of a train toilet, and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.
Before leaking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he will do.
But the experiment, filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", brought some surprising results to light.
The idea of licking the sink button of a train toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright became known for testing the resistance of his gut by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public railings at railway stations to flushing buttons of toilets, the task definitely put his immune system under a test
As a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water.
In the film, he was in any case justified by his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sample line showed a luminometer number of over 4000 units.
In comparison, the luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to leak after their luminometer count was over 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
In the film, he says, "That's the worst thing I've smoked in a toilet, close to it."
There is nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything here because it's disgusting in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.
The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Valio’s Senior Venice President for Snacks, Juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We went through crazy brainstormings that ended with us saying, “Let’s call Ian.”
They claim that interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: “Let me tell you this – I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I instructed him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film.”
Of course, there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others where this was quite difficult.
I'm glad we've included some of these dirty treats on film."
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all lactic acid bacteria surveyed associated especially with the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products that contain added lactic acid bacteria.
Asocial Family Destroyed Before Delogation Social Apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
An asocial family left their social housing after a <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 delocation because she had terrorized her neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall.
After they were violently removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable state.
The walls had gaping holes, wooden planks were torn up, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated on the walls.
The family were relocated and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for Cornwall Housing’s house administration, said she fears the apartment will no longer be repaired.
She said, “It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don’t have to live that way.
There are many things to consider, as this property will probably be considered as not so beautiful part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious and so is their reputation.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and police said that the terror that the family had inflicted included street fighting with baseball bats, intimidators of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive screaming, fighting, and cursing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order for anti-social behavior in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old garbage was found
It was in the estate in which drugs were traded in the past, that wooden parts were torn up
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and had to be called to the police regularly
Cornwall Housing delisted her and her partner this week forcibly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily move out.
The delogation was cheered by relieved neighbors who said their lives were made hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.”
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to that!
Now that they are finally gone, it will be beautiful.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Cornwall Housing’s Neighborhood Enforcement Manager, said it would have neglected the family to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years.
On the overgrown side of the town hall, garbage and old toys were thrown down
He added: "It is a shame that the tenant neglected to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family, as a delogation is always the last step that Cornwall Housing is considering.
This was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be terrible for their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, and members of the community who bravely approached us and sent us the information.
I hope that this development will give some neighbors comfort and convey the message that anti-social behavior is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house after delogation on the floor
Home office workers will now have to clear away waste mountains that surround the house
In 2014, police raided the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash of <0xC2><0xA3>1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after she pleaded guilty to possession of a Class B drug for commercial purposes.
She claimed that the money for a tombstone was her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being without a home, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many room walls of the house were smeared with graffiti.
Police say they will delog tenants who do not comply with house rules
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall police said the delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not comply with the house rules.
"This is for those who think they can behave without self-promotion and for those who have been harmed by such behavior," she said.
Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panic after a low-flying military jet flies over beach
Sun worshipers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion Air Force plane set off an incredible crash flight
The air force said it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no safety risk.
This was the moment when frightened tourists start to panic after a deep-flying jet crashes over a full beach.
Dramatic video footage showed the military plane flying almost in reach over the sun worshippers on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers jumped up when they began to understandably worry about the noise of the jet engines, without first seeing what was coming on them through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-by on social media, said: “It flew twice really deep and there was a moment when it looked like it was crashing.”
Nuno Arroja added, "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were panicked when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep
The Portuguese air forces today indicated that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to detect them.
The spokesman said the jet was flying slightly lower than usual due to the poor visibility conditions due to nearby surface fires, but the air forces insisted that safety was at no time compromised.
Land fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, killing four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air forces today indicated that the pilot had to fly so low due to the conditions - strong fog and fire smoke - which restricted his view.
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with concerns against Sevilla
Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting on Sunday for the first step to the first title win in the new football season.
The Catalans compete for the Spanish Supercup against FC Sevilla in the duel, and the return match rises three days later at Camp Nou.
The double winner has to give up Neymar, who competes with Brazil in the Olympic football tournament, at the hands of the inferior Cup finalist and reigning Europa League champion.
Goalie Marc-Andre ter Stegen is also missing.
In training, the German suffered a ligament sprain in his knee, which clarified the one-off question at Barca at least for the time being in favor of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing for the status of number one in Barcelona for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far waived a clear decision in this regard and left Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen took the lead in most other applications.
Before the first mandatory game of the new season, the Spanish champion has doubts about the team's fitness status, which was humiliated on Saturday in a Liverpool test game with 0:4.
Lionel Messi and Co. didn’t really convince at the 3-2 in the trial gallop against Sampdoria on Wednesday either.
Sevilla, on the other hand, has to digest the 2:3 defeat after an extension in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and is aiming for the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona is the record winner in this competition with eleven successes so far.
Ma Long in his own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion.
The 27-year-old defeated his countryman and "title defender" Zhang Jike 4-0 (12,5,4,4) in a one-sided final on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro.
With this, the world ranking first got the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes at the World Cup, World Cup, World Tour final tournament and even Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
As expected, the two Chinese made it into the final game and made up the title among themselves.
This made it clear that for the third time in a row, a Chinese would pick up the single title under the sign of the Five Rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympic staircase was the former SVS-N<0xC3><0x96> Legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the record, between sets and time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had retreated to the stands and left their protectors alone in the fair competition.
"The matches so far I have played for my country."
“I’m playing for myself in the final,” Zhang said.
After the match, gold and silver medalists posed with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma really struggled with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first set.
After that, he set the pace on the record and left Zhang with only a total of 13 points.
Because of Ma’s superiority, the expected thrilling match did not develop.
Nevertheless, there were enough stunning ball changes to be seen.
Mizutani won the bronze match against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
In his quarter-final against German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, the White Russ had contracted a rib injury, was then in medical treatment, had to "finally" settle with sheet metal.
By the way, the Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had become Olympic fourths in similarly high table tennis age.
Donald Trump admits “great problems” in the election campaign
The leadership of the U.S. Republicans is plagued by massive concerns about losing their majority even in traditionally conservative states.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses in his election campaign in the former Utah Republican stronghold.
A rare moment in which the usually large-scale and self-confident multimillionaire expressed something like concerns, correspondents reported.
After throwing 16 rivals out of the race within his own Republican camp, doubts are now growing about his success in the fight for the White House.
“We have huge problems in Utah,” Trump told evangelical Christians, who he asked for support in important states such as Ohio, Florida, or Virginia.
Guilt is false reports of his candidacy, he resumed his well-known media chatter.
Waking up Republican strongholds
Utah is usually a safe bank for Republicans.
According to a June survey by SurveyUSA, Trump and his rival of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, were the same.
Other institutions are ahead of Trump, but not by the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also at risk.
In an interview with CNBC, Trump responded to the question of how he would want to stop Clinton’s advance again: “Certainly, as I have done so far.”
And shove afterwards: This will "either be successful, or I will make a very nice, long holiday".
He does nothing but “tell the truth.”
“If it’s not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that’s fine,” Trump said.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the Trump party threatened to withdraw funds to support its campaign if it could not present better poll scores.
Instead, the Republican candidates would be more likely to be in the hands of Congress.
Olympia: Driest Fraud in Doping Test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.
Kenya's athletes are at risk after the second doping affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
After a fraud attempt at doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee announced that it would immediately set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had reported that the former sprinter and current coach, John Anzrah, had given a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported to Kenya’s team management by the doping controllers.
The IAAF has asked the IOC for information on the case in order to pursue its own investigations, an IAAF spokesperson said.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the IOC, the IAAF will carry out an assessment," the IAAF said in a statement.
"He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and spent time as Ferguson Rotich, giving the sample and signing it," said Kenya's chief of mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the athlete's accreditation, which was on the list for the World Anti-Doping Agency's training checks.
In 2015, Ferguson Rotich had become a World Cup runner-up in Beijing over 800 metres.
Four days earlier, Kenyan athletics delegation chief Michael Rotich had been withdrawn from the Rio games.
He is said to have informed athletes of his country’s upcoming doping tests against money payments.
According to media reports, he was arrested on his return to Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special observation for a long time after numerous doping offences at the IOC.
When announcing the IOC’s more than 2,000 doping targets before the Rio games, it was unusually pointed out beforehand that athletes from Kenya and Russia will be targeted.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before the Olympic Games began.
As a result, WADA Kenya took from the list of countries whose doping control is compliant with the rules of WADA.
Kenya is considered a great runner nation.
The country's athletes won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
A number of ARD television reports have repeatedly raised allegations that doping funds are easily accessible in Kenya and that there should be a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had done in Russian athletics.
It has been proven that this sport has been extensively and systematically doped.
Russian athletes were excluded from the Summer Games.
Salzburg's West Side Story with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple, similar to Romeo and Juliet.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the temple of classical music and fulfilled himself with the role of Mary a youth dream.
In the orchestral grave the Sim<0xC3><0xB3>n Bol<0xC3><0xAD>var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm", he swarms.
We always say that it is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody.
It is a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein’s music in our blood!
In this production, Bartoli plays an older Maria.
She recalls her love for Tony with sadness, while the younger Maria plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First, because it is musically extraordinary!
And then there was Mary’s personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright".
So she is smart, of course also naive, and very passionate.
“She is very similar to me, to my Italian character, which I have as a Roman woman,” Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It is such an honor for us to work with her.
She is a very generous person.
And Bartoli gives the compliment back: "Dudamel is such an exceptional artist and very passionate!"
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You can see it in every movement, in his eyes, it is his life!
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, which is very important at all!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the West Side Story is highly topical: "This piece is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New Yorkers did not want them.
These are the same topics, and they are as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned a few weeks ago about her death in Raqqa, Syria.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air strike in Raqqa, the group's bulwark in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she intended to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
“One can only hope that the only good is in it — as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone — to keep people from ever making that decision,” Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a plane to Turkey and then boarded a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana’s family was told she married an ISIS fighter in Syria — and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says Clinton will stay with Garland as a candidate for Supreme Court in case of election victory
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland’s confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the deceased judge to the Supreme Court Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a conference call that he expects Clinton to select Garland "with some degree of certainty."
A spokeswoman for Reid later said he had not yet spoken to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and speculate.
He praised Garland and said Clinton’s team would not cause unrest with a new candidate.
Garland is the Supreme Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocked Garland's nomination, including Lakaien and assistants to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump was unsuitable for the presidency.
Treats wants nude calendar for "women and for men"
Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere to release a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Calendar for 2017.
The editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine is different from old school playboys because "playboy is for men".
I do this for women.
He seems to think the calendar does too.
"We need to return to portray timeless and classic nudity, where both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body," Shaw said in a press release.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their images online or in person on an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass flight
“Anyone who doesn’t adapt and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed suitcases,” says Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-based Dialogue and World Foundation.
The Kurdish community of Germany expects tens of thousands of protection seekers to flee Turkey to Germany in the short term.
In the medium term, it could even become “a few hundred thousand,” says union chairman Ali Toprak.
Due to the hard action of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany.
“In the short term, I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term, of a few hundred thousand protection seekers from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition,” said Ali Toprak, chairman of the association.
Because the government had already overtaken Kurdish strongholds with criminal actions months ago, 500,000 Kurds within Turkey are on the run.
After the failed coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks were added.
Many will want to start anew in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey.
"It cannot be that a state that itself accepts refugees produces refugees in its own country," Toprak said.
The head of the association complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevi cities.
Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last major minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been exterminated or expelled in the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a member of the CDU.
The head of the federation demanded that the federal government "position itself as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters".
Also in Germany there is a "witch hunt" against Erdogan critics.
I have not felt safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and oppositionists.
The branding as a Gülen supporter destroys teachers and other academics’ professional existence.
“Anyone who doesn’t adapt and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed suitcases, by the way, even the Kemalists and Seculars,” said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-related Foundation Dialogue and Education, the “World”.
As the newspaper reports, citing figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks represented the largest group of asylum seekers recognized for political persecution in Germany even before the coup.
As of June 30, these were 11,386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all asylum-seekers (39,625).
This survey does not include those fleeing war, poverty or lack of perspective.
The right to asylum under the Basic Law is exclusively political, i.e. by the state side, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Going where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals get nothing from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.
In 2021, the state election will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because it’s not going to be any dumber than before: summer vacation, heat and national election campaign – that bites.
The locals, who are to be convinced by the election campaigners, are on vacation.
The vast majority of holidaymakers who are in the country, traveling on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so are not allowed to choose the country day.
In addition, there are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers who hang up posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and end up counting votes are only laborious to pick up.
Until 4 September 2016, the election and last holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again let the election campaign pass by the people.
The hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun.
And it’s also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD/CDU coalition, must fear for his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.
It’s exciting how much new AfD is cutting off and what’s left in the end for the coalition.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, is making an almost inconspicuous campaign, disregarding his large-scale posters.
He travels through the country, spreads roses and chats a little with the people, just as his legendary wortkarger predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, Seelering has gotten cold feet and blames Chancellor Merkel on the flourishing of the AfD.
Their refugee policy, their "We create this" has accelerated the rise of right-wing populists, which is now likely to cost him the nice job.
The CDU, with its top candidate, Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to campaign in the right place at the wrong time.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale demonstrations; Merkel’s Bundestag constituency is in the northeast.
But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony than Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.
"There was probably a majority from other federal states," complained Vincent Kokert, secretary general of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But it doesn’t hurt anyone from other parts of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely dispenses with the usual campaign stands on marketplaces and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.
According to Kokert, this only plays a "lower role".
The Union has also noticed that in the country you are breaking away from the base, that it has to make a lot of effort to find a wire to the people again.
You are like the Left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly present in the vastness of the country.
However, the advice of the CDU electoral champion Kokert to his fellow contenders is also self-explanatory: "You have to go where it hurts, namely where the people are: village parties, golden weddings, every birthday celebration has to be used".
Because a lot is at stake, Sellering has now called on its SPD to launch a particularly committed campaign.
In recent surveys, the Social Democrats were behind partners CDU (25) and just before the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had still clearly won with 35.6 percent ahead of the CDU (22).
The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into the nation’s day.
They make the holiday need a modern virtue and put their campaign largely on the Internet.
“Online election campaign,” the country’s chairman, Claudia Müller, calls it.
Otherwise, green campaigners are looking for local voters among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, just curves through the Mecklenburg lakes with a houseboat and still finds it beautiful.
Your impression: "Election holiday in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment".
B27 renovation: restaurants suffer from blockage
There is nothing to complain about the speed at which the B 27 is reconditioned.
For those responsible for the construction work, who start at 5.30 a.m. and end only at 8 p.m., there is praise everywhere.
“They’ve made everything pretty tacky,” says Elvira Tetzlaff of the jet gas station.
This is a super team.
There is also no delay.
The construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week at half-time, and everything should be ready by the end of October.
The reception of those responsible for the construction work is also praised, for example when it comes to the establishment of emergency entrances.
Since the construction site has migrated south on Monday and the blocking of Aspergstra<0xC3><0x9F>e in Oftedingen has also been lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg again exists, the traffic situation within the town has relaxed.
The citizens can now travel from Ofterdingen to the B 27 again on both sides.
Avoidance traffic through the place seems to be declining.
“There have been some significant complaints,” said Florian King, deputy chief executive officer responsible for the traffic management of the refurbishment.
The inhabitants of Bachsatzstra<0xC3><0x9F>e, Steinlachstra<0xC3><0x9F>e, Hafnerstra<0xC3><0x9F>e and Weiherrain had to struggle with more traffic noise, because many traffic lanes were looking for and trusted their navigator rather than the signage.
As a result, some trucks were wrecked in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were not complied with, the municipality increasingly requested the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
“There have been significant exceedances,” says King, who once informed himself about the situation on the spot.
Two to three flashes per minute have already been flashed.
The fastest was on the road with 77 kilometers per hour in the tempo 30 zone.
Since the construction site has moved on, it has become calmer.
For the business people at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the street is now open again.
Business people don’t like to look into the cards.
But the fact that the B 27 renovation has led them to revenue cuts makes everyone you ask look through.
However, some are more and some are less affected.
Anyone who has less to do with the "end customer", i.e. produces for other companies, for whom the renovation has hardly any consequences.
Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "highly slight decline" at the Maier Autohaus, but also admits that of course "the running skills are missing".
The most heavily baged are the locals along the road.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words.
This is already an existential threat.
Not just him, but all the restaurants have "hardly met".
Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We have to be happy about every Euro turnover.
The decline in sales is "over 50 percent".
The road remediation had "thrown back" its operation for two years.
Half of his staff had to be fired.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half had been fired, the policy would have reacted differently.
Instead, Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt responded to a request from Göhner about whether there could be a financial compensation, stating that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at B27. Now they must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation.
Göhner knows from other counties where something more generous has been handled.
With all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.
After all, the family business has been based here since 1715, he refers to the long history.
He can understand that other regular guests are now less likely to visit because of the complicated traffic management.
If you can't drive here, it's beautiful elsewhere.
Göhner has no doubt that his regular clientele will return after the renovation works have ended.
Despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on his clientele to be the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its many years of history.
Six months of construction work, that's brutal.
In the name of counter-terrorism, laws are constantly being tightened.
Following the recent attacks, Minister of the Interior de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re is now presenting a thick security package.
But what does a tolerance status have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re gives the conciliator.
All his proposals are "politically reasonable" to the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister of the Interior at the presentation of his new security package.
They do not overwhelm anyone.
Other, further points would initially be discussed within the parties.
I also participate in it.
As Minister of the Interior, however, he was based on results and on a “achievable consensus” within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re spent a little time before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
However, they are now all the more extensive.
Some things are already known, announced, pointed out: that a new security authority should take care of cracking encrypted communications is not new.
Nor the fact that Germany has to implement several EU regulations on passenger data and gun rights.
Nor does the call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities come as a surprise.
In part, de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re is launching a second call for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: he wants to punish sympathy advertising for terrorist groups and double-citizen jihadists by tapping the German passport.
“These will be difficult points for the SPD,” admits the CDU man.
He nevertheless considers this reasonable and also does not ask for anything that does not have any chances with the coalition partner anyway.
A few new ideas de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re also presents.
They have it partly in themselves: He plans quick procedures for deportations and more opportunities for detention of people before deportation.
Refugees who are specifically brought into the country should have their smartphones checked beforehand and disclose social media accounts for a security check.
He wants to put some people worse off than before – for example, those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to disguise their identity.
Some of them are politically and legally sensitive.
Some also seem unspoken and leave questions open.
And on some points - for example, in the unequal treatment of the patient - the question arises: what does this have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror.
But it cannot be said that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, in view of the high numbers of refugees, many people were concerned about safety.
And things that were deeply occupied by people could not be ruled out even during election campaigns.
Internal security has become a huge focus.
Only the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
Uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are elections.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly taking a stand on the issue of internal security.
In the past few days, the two parties have gone high.
First a heated dispute over the equipping of the Federal Police, then a security policy idea collection of some Union interior ministers, in which the Heads of Department also call for a Burka ban and a departure from dual citizenship.
The Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re also strives for conciliatory tones here.
He doesn’t think of a departure from the double pass.
We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.
Re-opening them doesn’t make sense.
And in the case of a burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether its own package is constitutionally fixed at all corners and whether it is actually "presumable" for the coalition partner, has yet to show itself.
There is a lot in it that could cause a dispute.
But the SPD is also currently trying to profile itself on the subject of internal security.
Sigmar Gabriel, leader of the party, said: “The SPD is ready to talk about anything that helps to further increase security.”
Volkswagen is still coming through.
Despite the diesel scandal, the number of deliveries is increasing worldwide.
However, not all markets are running smoothly.
In the recall action, there is a vortex around a term.
Volkswagen will start more cautiously in the second half of the year.
Europe’s largest automaker can continue to show a boost in the past year despite the diesel deal thanks to its many brands and some well-run markets.
However, in July, the core brand VW weakened mainly in Western Europe, again burdening the total sales, as the company listed in the Dax announced.
Worldwide, the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles in July with 449,100 cars than in the previous month.
In Western Europe alone, after China’s second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous month.
In Germany’s home market, deliveries fell by almost a sixth.
Brand sales chief Jürgen Stackmann attributed the weaker figures from July to two sales days less in Europe.
In addition, in some core markets there has been a "changed economic framework" of a buy-back.
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote on leaving the EU has also been burdened, a spokeswoman said.
In the United States, where the exhaust gas deal first escalated, there is also a minus to be booked.
Great support for VW is the Chinese market.
All in all, the mainly affected house brand of the Lower Saxony is still slightly affected by the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only a delivery minus of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is available.
Group sales chief Fred Kappler was able to continue to show a sales increase from January to July.
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles during this time, with 5,904 million vehicles worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust gas tests with software.
In Germany alone, VW is calling around 2.5 million cars for conversion to the workshops.
In the course of the conversion, VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects.
After the conversion of the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.
The automaker will issue a "guarantee-like" certificate to the customer after the conversion, but will not say about a "guarantee", as was stated in corporate circles on Friday.
The reason is legal subtleties.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen is now granting its German customers a guarantee for retrofitted diesel models.
This was confirmed by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that this meeting had taken place.
"VW has to fully comply with the requirements of my commission of inquiry and the KBA."
“Deviations of this will not be accepted,” Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) said in a statement.
VW has assumed the guarantee that, in the case of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after the conversion, there will be no deterioration and all type-approval-relevant vehicle values will remain unchanged.
However, Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee" as it was called in corporate circles.
With the broad term "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers, for example, come to a workshop half a year after the conversion with a motor damage - and this could be attributed to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
In the interest of the customer, it is also important to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust gas scandal, as stated.
Therefore, VW does not use the term "guarantee".
Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee will require rich savers in the future to pay criminal interest - as the second institute in Germany.
Bank manager Josef Paul said on Thursday: “It’s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on giro or daily money accounts.”
The Federal Association of German Banks speaks of a single case and sees no signal in it: Normal savers should "not be afraid to pay for their savings interest".
If banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay their 0.4% penalty rate.
This fee will be charged by Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September onwards by private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros on giro or daily money accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
“The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future,” Paul said.
He has been keeping 40 million euros for quite some time, which could be lifted from one day to the next and which he cannot use.
“They’re in my central bank account and cost 0.4 percent,” he said.
“I can’t afford $4,000 for every million.”
The cost is now passed on according to the polluter principle.
Simply leaving the cash in the vaults of Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous: "I've already experienced four raids, I don't like the fifth one!", the bank's chief executive said.
Most customers had understanding and switched to other forms of investment.
Only a few people migrated to other banks.
The Bavarian Association of Cooperatives stated: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy rate causes considerable costs for all banks".
To carry them on their own is “uneconomically sustainable”.
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or transfers.
With criminal interest on deposits starting at three million euros, the Thuringian Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with its 2014 Skatbank branch.
Michael Kemmer, chief executive of the Banking Association, said: “We do not expect private customers to have to pay comprehensive fees for deposits, and competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is far too strong.”
A banker said there was "a clientele that is a little more luxuriantly endowed with wealth."
"This can become a problem for a small bank" if they keep money for free.
The cooperative bank Gmund, founded in 1911, has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
Well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region.
“No other banks are currently known to charge an expense compensation for deposits from private customers,” said spokesman Ernst.
At the end of June, Uwe Fröhlich, the president of the Federal Association of German Volksbanks and Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), declared: "The threshold to go negative towards the private customer is very, very high".
The competition is tough, and it threatens the migration of investors to the competition.
Customers in Germany will not be pleased with this in width.
Destination records: who actually buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men love records.
Before you rush to the comment section to ignore it under the pseudonym NotAll SingleMenMiddle Ages with harsh insults, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed resurgence of records is not due to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but rather to midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently bought a record are very likely between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
It’s also not a horde of hobbyists—it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers tend to keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are the results of YouGov correct?
If this blog were a news report on television, the camera would follow me as I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wear a modest gray suit and wildly bully before I stop, hold my hands and say something defining like, “So, let’s take a closer look at that.”
So, let's take a look at it.
Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm – hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were based – there are still a handful of fantastic record specialty stores.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (number of data: eight middle-aged men, a woman, presumably around 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and going through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I appreciate it," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn’t follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.
The reason he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he couldn’t afford when they appeared and buy again items he sold when he was young and broke.
"Many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things I was probably a little too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and like to spend time alone, adding, "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.
This is my vice.
Wez, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets apply to the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media hype, people who have heard about the comeback and see themselves buying their old records again.
Of the conversations I have had, people have usually gotten rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy back their records,” he says.
This would explain the boom of followers of the record revival of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional significance of records?
It only takes a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took the lead in the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers, objects that evoke happy youth memories.
“I think sometimes it can be filling a void or possessing material possessions as a kind of comfort,” says Wez.
It’s like that for me as a collector, and I think it’s like that for a lot of people.
It is an easy way to engage spiritually.
"We're like their social workers!" an employee flutters from a panel pile.
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a record last month haven’t listened to it yet.
The survey also found that 41% own a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not own a record player.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look very worried as I scroll through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data count: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.
“Someone just came in here recently and said, ‘I don’t own a record player, but I’d like to buy a Radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf,’” he says.
This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-heavy, less music-heavy.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older people, who only come in slowly.
Fopp, who has devoted almost an entire floor to the records, has a more colorful audience when I go in.
There are couples around 70, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Even if the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above-mentioned stores - Wild Beast's latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz is thronging out of the speakers - it's good to see such diversity among customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but nagging psychological traumas are hard to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around the store for a few minutes and is looking at the variety of records for sale.
She makes a shop window stroller rather than a big buy.
She doesn’t earn much, so collecting records isn’t a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It’s easy to hear music from a computer or any other way, but the beauty of records is...” she drifts off with a lover sigh.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I seem to be muttering the jeans hotpants, I watch a group of young teenage girls group around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter consider buying a Crosley turntable.
On the left is a stairwell, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far up that it is impossible to touch them.
It's pure "plate art."
But considering that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and could send some customers to the Deep Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It’s no surprise that a population that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends the most on luxury items such as records.
Even though my research showed that the results of YouGov are correct, at least in record stores in Soho, they do not take into account the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
They certainly don’t spend their Thursday morning strolling through record stores on Berwick Street and flipping through records while avoiding the staring look of a creepy, 30-year-old false presenter who questions over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - Video report
Scientists say Greenland shark has the longest lifespan of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who examines sharks, says the record was set for a female, who is assumed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long.
French court rejects offer to demolish shops in jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais to demolish dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
At a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be empowered to demolish 72 provisional stores where people inside the warehouse sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy, from which no taxes would be paid and which pose a fire and sanitation risk.
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-backed association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also stated that the temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for expelling people who run the 72 provisional business, but conceded that Calais prefecture's concerns were "absolutely understandable."
Judge Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Molla said that the grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just feeding people who “live in extremely precarious conditions.”
He said the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the demolition was the Jungle Book Kids’ Café of the camp, which is run non-profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as counseling on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it said the closure "would be a disaster for these children, the youngest of whom are eight years old."
The migrant’s two aid organizations Help Refugees and L’Auberge estimated Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to over 9,000 — the highest number to date — after a steep increase in new arrivals over the summer.
Despite Olympic Disappointment: Martin Remains Combatant
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic time trial, cycling pro Tony Martin does not want to be let down.
“I’ll keep an eye on the World Cup, stay confident and keep fighting,” the 31-year-old wrote on Facebook on Thursday before leaving Rio de Janeiro.
He does not have an explanation for his miserable twelfth place at the Sugar Hat.
“It’s really hard for me to comment on yesterday’s timing,” Martin said.
He had to calmly analyze what reasons led to the debacle.
At the World Championships in Qatar in October, Martin actually wanted to compete for the title.
“I’ll look at everything we’ve changed in the past.”
"This also includes my position," wrote the three-time time trial world champion, who had lost more than three minutes on Wednesday to the 54.5 km on Olympic winner Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland).
Olympia: Tennis pro Siegemund misses semi-final
The winning streak of Laura Siegemund ended in the quarterfinals of Rio: The world rankings 32nd from Metzingen missed by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA no.
34) the semi-final of the Olympic tennis tournament clearly.
Siegemund, who was plagued by back problems, was only able to make her mark once and seemed powerless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, medal hopeful Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2) had the chance to jump into the preliminary round.
The Australian Open winner met the British Johanna Konta (No. 10).
As the last German tennis pro, Tommy Haas had won a silver medal in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB starters in the quarter-finals of summer games had last been there in 1992.
Never before has a German duo been in an Olympic single-half final.
Group joins start-up for live video game transmissions
Watching other people play video games is a giant cent – Microsoft wants to benefit from this too.
The technology group buys the start-up beam, which specializes in this hobby.
Microsoft did not announce how much money would be spent on the acquisition on Thursday.
Beam started its offering in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others play, but also intervene on your own.
For example, they can give up missions and face enemies as well as provide equipment.
Activision Blizzard is launching a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook is supposed to help.
The advertising industry is already listening.
The employees of the startup, which has its headquarters in Seattle, Washington, move to Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, California, according to Beam co-founder and CEO Matt Salsamendi.
Therefore, nothing should change for the customers through the acquisition.
According to Microsoft, Beam will be integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The market for live streaming of video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Well-known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was bought by online retailer Amazon in 2014 – for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming is part of the Google mother alphabet.
Here comes the enforcement trailer.
Germany’s racers have to adapt to the next generation of speedometers: In various federal states, including Hesse and Brandenburg, new flash devices are being tested, which are supposed to transfer tempo sensors particularly effectively.
For example, the futuristic-looking Enforcement Trailers of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used at accident focal points where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, at motorway construction sites or bridges with temporary speed limits to be rehabilitated, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with the speed limit with a stationary flasher.
However, a permanent mobile setup can be too dangerous or expensive.
The enforcement trailer is self-contained: its battery lasts five days in continuous measurement mode, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.
With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can also be detected simultaneously over several tracks.
Variable speed limits as well as transit bans by time, lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In the elevated state you can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with any car with trailer coupling.
In order that it is not easily stolen, it is lowered in the measuring operation, so that the wheels in the armored and, incidentally, also bulletproof outer shell disappear.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is designed to protect the flasher from vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer has been tested and used in various federal states, according to Vitronic.
Foreign authorities also flash with the new technology: Recently France has ordered 100 pieces, after an order of 150 pieces last year.
UK gets silver in 7th Rugby after Fiji masterclass gets gold
The impressive performance of the UK at 7th Rugby came to an abrupt halt in the final on Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the form of Fiji, when they were beaten with a score of 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji awarded a master class in handling, side-stepping, trailing, line running and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament, beating New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall back on them in the final.
But regardless of that, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in best form in this form.
It could be a consolation for GB – but it probably won’t – that at least one Briton will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fiji’s head coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult path behind it.
Eight years ago, Ryan lost every game to the Adelaide Sevens.
Here they lost only one.
This slump will hurt, but progress is amazing.
Fiji started off wonderfully and let the attacks of GB bounce off for fun.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and Co., the World Series winners went 5-0 up when Osea Klinisau took over the corner.
With another four minutes of play, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he converted.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's outstanding tackle stopped the man Leone Nakarawa's mountain to score a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua looked for a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the reboot and there was still over a minute playing time... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou preached through further weak tackles of the GB team and stormed to the line to make a goal.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.
It’s like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.
That's the way it is.
GB made fundamental changes at half time and closed the fijian gap...for as long as four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half, until Joshua Tuisova went through after a brilliant intermediate play by Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went on for a long time in favor of the South Sea Islanders whose fans were singing, waving flags and dancing on the stands.
It was not difficult to admire Fiji’s playful approach.
Mata Viliame put the i-tip in the last seconds with another attempt.
The whistle sounded, the Fijians embraced, and GB kicked devastatingly beaten in the grass.
Earlier that day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-finals by 20-5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa out of the race in a tight semi-final match - Britain's conversion of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackle by Marcus Watson, Anthony's brother of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by the coach's battle with cancer for rowing victory
There will be no more emotional gold than in these games and that will mean something.
From the first rowing to the last, 220 hard hives that go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Although it was only the two who sat on the helm, there were three voices in the boat: the echo of coach Robin Williams, was all-important when they rowed to the second Olympic gold in the two without a tax woman in succession, the first women in the history of British sports to set such a standard.
Their dominance was absolute, after all, their 39th unbeaten commitment, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes who glide across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not fully reflect the nature of the triumph.
Behind every gold in the rowing is a battalion of willing helpers that contribute to the incremental progress that makes up the difference and there was no one more helpful than the coach who 30 months ago did not know if he would survive that day at all than he was diagnosed with cancer.
Like he said, he was risky.
I had bladder cancer that is operable and they did.
If you don’t, it spreads everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the outlook a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky to be able to start treatment in early 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that is the right term under such circumstances at all.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would be enough.
That's how it starts.
Rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.
In the immediacy of victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-wracking morning talking about it a little more than usual and trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was on a mission in Afghanistan as a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment, said "I was an emotional wreck this week. That's maybe a bit extreme, but it means so much."
It just repeats how much that means to me, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so a massive thank you goes to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I could not have wished for a better person to train or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to join, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught at the moment.
Helen called out, “Stay in the process, stay in the process.”
It is really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren’t going to do something great.
We didn’t want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, whatever we did.
The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future.
Glover has to appear at a wedding next week, her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn’t want to say it was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic winner.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes.
It feels so much better,” she said.
31 years of exemplary clarity
The Managing Director of the Water Purpose Association "Veitensteingruppe", Ruppert Göller, retires.
The association is considered "Bavarian-wide exemplary".
A small Franconian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers.
Some time ago, it was said in the original tone in a contribution by the Bavarian Broadcasting Corporation.
A little later, the Water Forum of the Government of Lower Franconia appreciated the purpose association.
The work of the Veitenstein Group was considered "to be exemplary" throughout Bavaria.
Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who was a staff member for 31 years, of which 28 years as Managing Director.
He was now retired at the age of 65.
The drinking water association of the Veitensteingruppe, based in Kottendorf, Breitbrunn municipality, annually promotes about 150000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 places and hamlets with about 5,500 inhabitants.
Member municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities.
The current chairman, Breitbrunn's mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a water watchman in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Association of Purposes in 1988.
“His tasks have been very diverse and they ranged from water pipeline construction and maintenance work to office and organizational activities, budgeting, charging fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends,” the chairman said.
As outstanding events, she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation of farmers, the renovation of the high tanks (1999), the re-acquisition of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipes.
There was no standstill, and innovations have been introduced over and over again, because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her laudation, she praised Göller’s faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has used a lot of heart blood for his water-purpose association and he has lived the water-purpose association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein group for nitrate reduction in front of the water forum of the district Unterfranken.
He received a lot of recognition and praise.
Rupert Göller, for his part, praised Wasserwart Alfons Griebel, who had worked with him for 28 years.
He is the best waterman and he was a faithful boy.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
From his point of view, he referred to the well construction and the restructuring of the purpose association.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult use, however, was the pipe break at the high tank at Kirchlauter on January 3.
Here, at minus 17 degrees, we had to work all night so that the villages could be supplied with water.
The supply of Neubrunn could only have been maintained once, because the high tank from Pettstadt was filled with hoses.
The management of the Drinking Water Association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko openly deals with her son Tiago's autism - and turns to other affected parents: "You must have the courage to talk about it."
“The medicine has made great progress,” said the 44-year-old of the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When the disease was recognized by her son, she believed she had to die.
However, the now eight-year-old Tiago has progressed well and is now learning privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
“To give an example: if I ask him something that is two years behind me when I sang at Milan’s Scala, he doesn’t remember anything,” Netrebko said.
He is the happiest person on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection with the bass baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to the tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship state in Bargteheide - Man shoots at lifemate
A 35-year-old man shot his partner in a multi-family house in Bargteheide (Kreis Stormarn) on Friday around 10.45 a.m. and fatally injured her.
"The man himself called us and said he shot his life partner," a police spokeswoman said.
The perpetrator is on the run, after him is found publicly.
Meanwhile, nationwide, because Sven S. could be on the road by car.
The man is about 1.80 meters tall, muscular, brown-burned and has a smoothness.
Meanwhile, the police released a photo of him.
However, it is a few years old.
Meanwhile, the man is wearing a slick.
The man should not be addressed directly.
He could still carry the gun with him, police said.
Anyone who sees Sven S. should call the 110.
The police are talking about a "relationship state."
The victim was born in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
The police in Lübeck initially did not want to provide information about the Tathergang or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, but she confirmed that a person had been killed.
"It's a homicide."
“We’re not saying anything else at the moment,” a police spokesman said in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a Special Operations Command (SEK) was at the scene.
Steel - Light vision for the German steel industry
The crisis-ridden and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared millions of dollars in additional costs.
Financial burdens that threaten the industry from the promotion of green electricity are off the table.
It remains in the liberation from the renewable energy conversion of the existing plants to so-called in-house electricity production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister of Economics Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday issue).
“I’m really happy that we were finally able to achieve this after two years of tough negotiations.”
The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask steel producers using blast furnace gases to generate electricity for their own consumption to checkout.
According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel told the WAZ that there is now a principle agreement with the EU Commission after talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in the steelworks will an EEG conversion of 20 percent occur.
But they are also not raised in the steel industry.
IG Metall welcomed Germany’s agreement with the EU Commission on the production of its own electricity.
This largely defines the status quo of the previous regulation.
Gabriel’s successful efforts for the steel industry are of particular importance.
“In terms of our ‘Steel is Future’ campaign, this is a first step.”
"More must follow."
"Climate and employment targets must also be considered in the reform of emissions trading," said IG Metall chief Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and considerable price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis.
Last year, the situation continued to worsen as the world’s largest producer country, China, threw massive amounts of steel on the world market in the face of weakening domestic demand.
European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies of price dumping.
Over the course of this spring, the situation has relaxed somewhat.
On the one hand, imposed import duties on import steel have an effect, and on the other hand, the economic outlook in China has been brightened.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Recently, prices have stagnated again.
The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude closures of individual works.
At the end of 2015, around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry.
In July, the German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
At 3.4 million tonnes, they produced well six percent less crude steel than in the previous month, the Steel Economic Association said on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the quantity produced now went back the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent below the previous year’s figure.
The association expects to see an increase in emissions in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation.
Community, Spirit, Health: Singing Does Seniors Good
Singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl, she was in the school choir, in the teacher’s studies, she studied music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
“Singing moves me – emotionally and physically,” she says.
After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and more alive overall, she says.
By the way, she does something good for her health and mind.
Singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, Hackler describes.
Through regular co-operation, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.
Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
Ursel Kipp has also made this experience in her choir: "To speak up and organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together".
Singing can be stressful in a positive sense, Hackler says.
In doing so, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.
Those who demand their lungs regularly do not get out of the breath so quickly even in everyday life.
Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age, Singing is an optimal hobby.
Singing often has a very special effect on older people, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Working Group of Senior Organizations.
In the older generations, singing together had a much higher importance, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people evokes many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through lyrics and especially melodies, self-dense people are drawn to long-standing events.
When singing, the head is also required a special performance, explains Lenz.
Focusing on your own voice and on a predetermined rhythm at the same time, adapting to the other singers – that’s a big cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone practice not just focusing on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition you get from singing in the choir, Hackler says.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
Self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.
To show myself: When I practice for a long time for something, I get better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.
There are good reasons to start singing, so there are enough.
If you want to try out a new hobby, do not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, advises Lenz.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who can hear when a sound goes down?
Looking for the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.
If someone from the circle of acquaintance sings in a senior choir, you can simply join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.
If you want to sing in an ecclesiastical choir, you can contact the church or the head of the church directly.
Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.
If you do not have access to the Internet, you can ask your family, friends or neighbors for help with your internet research.
Anyone who wants to sing should definitely join a choir, advises Hackler.
Singing does the soul good and has something liberating - this applies to all ages.
Cats react more sensitively than cats to cries of young animals
In Hanover, biologists have investigated the effect of calling cat babies on adult animals.
To their surprise, the miauen did not leave the males cold either - but they always behaved the same, unlike the females.
Female cats can recognize the degree of excitement of cat babies at the miauen of the little ones.
They respond by ten percent faster to the sounds of kittens, who are in great need, as scientists from the Veterinary University and the Medical University of Hannover (MHH) have found out.
Cats also respond to the calls of kittens - but always the same.
“Obviously, the acoustic differences between the mia of less and strongly excited young animals are either not perceptible or not significant for the males,” said biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study, which was published this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous study, the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of kitten screams differ with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight kittens from the animal husbandry of the MHH were observed.
On the one hand, they were played by little ones who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from their mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with cries of more excited kittens, which were additionally raised.
The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the small sample.
"All the females, even those who had not yet had their own offspring, reacted differently to the screams," Konerding said.
They turned faster to the speaker when this call played the much more excited kitten.
This ability may be congenital or developing with sexual maturity.
"A surprise was that the males reacted at all," the biologist said.
In the past, scientists have already investigated the reactions of women and men to baby noise in humans several times.
Also, some studies showed that women responded more sensitively to infants, whether they were already mothers or not, biologist Marina Scheumann reported.
Podolski takes over with "Gala" to Supercup
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest warrant has been issued against former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the coup attempt, an important football match will take place in Turkey.
Before the duel of the arch rivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolski's Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is announced.
Already in the imposition of the state of emergency after the attempted overthrow in July, the government insisted that the everyday life of ordinary citizens should not be affected.
However, this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom one blames for the attempted coup.
There is also no stopping before football.
Against former starkicker Hakan Sükür, the prosecutor’s office issued a warrant for arrest.
According to this, Sükür, now living in America, is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür is said to be a supporter of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Although the state of emergency, initially imposed for 90 days, is still valid until October, but in fact this has virtually no effect on the lives of most Turks.
The night-time “democracy watch” in public places across the country has declared Erdogan quit on Wednesday.
The sport, like the whole country, is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
In particular, fans of the Besiktas workers’ club traditionally do not belong to the president’s friends.
What unites the majority of Turks, however, in the face of dramatic experiences in history, is the strict rejection of military coups.
Even the fans agree - whether their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
At the cup winner "Gala" it will especially arrive again on Lukas Podolski.
The Kölner proved his sporting value in the past season: with 17 goals and nine assists in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first season as top scorer of his club.
In the final match against Fenerbahce, he scored the 1-0 win.
The newspaper "Fanatik" cheered him: "He was the best in the square."
He finished the season in an excellent way and secured the trophy for his team.
Thanks to "Poldi", the disappointing season for the record champion found a conciliatory conclusion.
After the preliminary round K.O. in the Champions League, the "lions" were also eliminated early in the Europa League.
In the Süper Lig it was only 6th place.
The season was not good.
The cup was the only way to win something.
“We did that and that’s the most important thing,” Podolski said.
For Master Besiktas, the year of the game went better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who with 26 season hits as Süper-Lig-Torschützenkönig laid the foundation for the 14th title.
This is also the reason why fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
The Gomez, under contract at AC Florence and loaned to Besiktas only after the coup attempt, had announced that he would not return because of the political situation in the country after his European holiday.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," said Fikret Orman, head of the club.
But the striker would have to be willing to give up about a third of his annual salary estimated at 7.5 million euros, Orman made it clear: "We can't pay his salary at Florence".
Despite Doping: These Athletes Still Have Medal Chances at Rio Olympics
34-year-old Justin Gatlin has been banned twice for doping (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa is not allowed to start in Rio.
Other convicted athletics sinners can only laugh at it - they are fighting for medals in Rio.
The topic of doping still determines the headlines at the Rio Olympics.
Russian swimmer Julija Jefimova, who had filed for her right to start just before the games after a doping lock, was mercilessly plucked out and bent out at her start (100 meters chest).
There was a bizarre scene: with a smile she was still proud of herself in the hall and had provoked her appearance.
When it was determined that she would not get gold, the audience burst into a jubilant storm.
However, there are many other athletes who are starting despite the doping past at the Rio Olympics.
Here is an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100 m relay/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He had already been banned twice for doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since its inception, the 2004 Olympic champion and former World Champion has run even faster than before, being the world's number one over 100 m in 9.80 seconds and considered the biggest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100m-staff/Jamaica): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion had to sit down a six-month lockdown in 2010 after she was shown to be taking the painkiller Oxycodon.
She had severe toothache after surgery, the 29-year-old defended himself.
Sandra Perkovic (discussion/Croatia): In 2011, the Olympic champion from 2012, world champion from 2013 and European champion from 2010 to 2016 tested positive for the banned stimulant drug methylhexanamine.
Perkovic denied the knowing intake and was suspended for six months.
The four furthest litters this year go to the account of the big gold favourites.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400 m relay/USA): The Beijing Olympic champion and two-time world champion over 400 m, tested positive in 2010 and locked for 21 months.
A means of penis enlargement was responsible, Merritt said.
This year, the 30-year-old over 200 and 400 m is the fastest man in the world to date.
Ivan Tichon (Hammerwurf, Belarus): Hardly any athlete was subsequently denied so many medals.
Tichon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later after testosterone doping was detected.
The now 40-year-old also had to give up Olympic silver in 2004 due to steroid doping and the 2006 European Championship title due to testosterone abuse.
He also won the bronze medal at the 2008 Olympic Games due to a judgment of the International Sports Court CAS.
At 80.04 m, it ranks second in the world rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km walk, China): The world record holder and gold favorite was tested positive only in May, but is still allowed to start in Rio.
The 29-year-old World Champion found evidence of taking a banned dietary supplement, the blockage of the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA dropped out mildly and ran off already on July 13.
Bombing terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Several dead
The Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, Foreign Ministry spokesman Thomas Schnöll said Friday morning.
She had suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital, but had already been able to leave it again.
She planned her return trip for the beginning of September.
Whether Austrian citizens are affected by the further explosions on the Phuket holiday island as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon is still unclear for the time being.
In this regard, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities, Schnöll said.
Located about 200 kilometers south of the capital Bangkok, Hua Hin first exploded two bombs on Thursday evening in an outing district.
According to police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two more explosives went up again, with another person being killed, according to the authorities.
A bomb explosion was also reported by Phuket in the early morning.
A taxi driver was injured in the detonation near Patong Beach, which is popular with holidaymakers.
In Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country, another bomb exploded that killed an urban employee.
According to the authorities, the blast rate had gone up in a flowerbed in front of the coastal police station.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast and in Chumphon on the south-east coast demanded several casualties.
It is assumed that there is a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin.
"The bombings carry the same handwriting," Army General Danai Kritmethhavee told reporters Friday morning.
"We expect it to be a coordinated attack."
It’s too early to comment on possible motives – but it’s probably about the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police, on the other hand, said the attacks were not related to the Islamist insurgency movement or international terrorism.
“This is only local sabotage that is limited to limited areas and provinces,” a spokesman said in Bangkok.
Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
In recent days, the authorities have received intelligence reports of imminent attacks in the south of the country, but they have not been informed of the exact time and locations.
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.
The police instructed their officials across the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
In Thailand, there are always smaller bombings, but they usually do not target tourists.
Hua Hin is home to a palace that has been used by King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand for years.
Following the recent bomb explosions, the Austrian Foreign Ministry on its homepage strongly recommends that the Thai security authorities follow the instructions.
High security risk (Security Level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and the surrounding area.
After disputes between security forces and Muslim sections of the population, it is advised not to travel to these provinces before necessary.
Increased security risk (Security Level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
This will also give the military great influence in the coming years.
Junta chief and prime minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos as the country moves towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
The military unta, which took power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, benefits itself from having brought the kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has also failed to cope with the revolt of Muslim rebels, which has been raging for years in the far south of the country.
More than 6,500 people have been killed in the conflict.
Nearly a year ago, 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine in Bangkok, most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack in the country’s recent history.
The right-wing "Identitarian Movement" has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
After several state offices, the constitutional protectors in the federal government have also put the group under observation.
"We see evidence in the 'Identitarian Movement' of efforts against the liberal democratic basic order," said Hans-Georg Maa<0xC3><0x9F>en, head of the German press agency in Berlin.
Thus, immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are defamed in an extremist way.
That’s why we’re watching the movement now.
The "Identitarian Movement" is a group with French roots, which has also been active in Germany since 2012.
It opposes "multiculti-craze", "uncontrolled mass immigration" and the "loss of one's own identity through alienation".
Constitutionalists in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - already observe the "identitarians".
Maa<0xC3><0x9F>en said his authority had agreed closely with the state offices in the decision.
"Groups like the 'Identitarian Movement' are trying to pick up their target group where they stand," the head of the constitution said.
In general, extremists try to address them with youthful language, often with pop music.
This was done by Islamists as well as right-wing extremists.
This is not a good advertisement for your own business.
Propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
That's dangerous.
Recently, there had been reports from several federal states about contacts of the "identitarians" to AfD politicians.
Maa<0xC3><0x9F>en said he had no knowledge of this.
For the protection of the Constitution, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point.
It depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - changes its direction by certain people who are extremist and becomes so extremist.
It is therefore crucial whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is not visible.
In view of the significant increase in law-motivated crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maa<0xC3><0x9F>en said he would not yet speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But in recent years we have found that there can be right-wing terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freitaler Group.
It may well be that further right-wing terrorist groups or small groups are forming, planning attacks against asylum seekers, refugee homes or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives.
However, a Germany-wide or Europe-wide control of right-wing terrorism is not recognizable.
The previous groups were created at the regional level or on social networks.
Concerned, Maa<0xC3><0x9F>en said that many assaults went to the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene.
That's the worrying thing.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum accommodations had not previously been known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right-wing scene.
"So many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who were perhaps politically indifferent or, for example, chose CDU, SPD or left-wing, but then radicalized themselves by right-wing extremist sentimentalism."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes Internet hit
The Olympics or world records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.
This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was temporarily no longer seen in the TV pictures.
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cutout was selected.
In social networks, Habte subsequently became a viral Internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old ended his lead with a 48-second gap and finished 59th out of 59 starters.
However, it was rather his not-so-sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media.
Why does the 24-year-old still participate in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming association.
This is distributed to make swimming more popular in underrepresented countries.
Since most athletes are running in Ethiopia, I just wanted to do something different.
Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.
The first nicknames quickly made the round.
Some media referred to him as the "robel of the whale".
Based on a "well-being belly", the English tabloid "The Sun" made fun of him with "Dad Bod".
His time, he only hit with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter freestyle, didn't matter.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Eric Moussambani's run attracted media attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete in a run over 100 meters of freestyle alone.
Frenetically, Moussambani was fired at the time.
The then 22-year-old only learned to swim eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

Geretsried - The owner of a shop at Neue Platz has been stolen.
According to the police, the 67-year-old Geretsrieder had left her shop on Monday at around 5.30 p.m., forgetting to close a window on the ground floor.
When she returned the next morning around 8:15 a.m., about 250 euros had disappeared from the cash register.
Traces of the perpetrator could not be found.
There is also no video surveillance.
Trump does not see the impending election defeat as close
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at an election campaign event in Florida.
If the election as President of the United States is not going to happen, Donald Trump has an alternative idea.
He then goes on vacation.
If Donald Trump loses the U.S. presidential election in November, it would be relatively unimportant to him: “At the end of the day, it will either work out, or I will have a very, very nice, long vacation,” the Republican candidate said in a telephone interview with the U.S. television channel CNBC.
“If it’s not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that’s fine,” Trump said.
For example, he described US President Barack Obama and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton as the founder of the Islamic State (IS) terrorist militia.
Within his party, more and more resistance was formed.
Post enters trade with electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle of Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously great.
The Post plans to sell its electric vehicle StreetScooter as well.
Soon, the Group intends to start trading with the transporter.
The Post also wants to offer its electric transporters on the free car market from next year.
“We want to get into sales to third parties,” a post-speaker said on Friday.
The company has been testing for months whether to sell letters and parcels to other companies to its self-developed StreetScooter.
Post CEO Jürgen Gerdes had said that there are always requests, for example from craftsmen.
According to information from the news magazine "Der Spiegel", the Bonn-based group will shortly enter the mass production of the vehicles.
In the booming manufacturing, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift.
Gerdes had announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and in the long term was looking for a complete change to the environmentally friendly vehicles.
“We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020,” he said at the end of July.
I can imagine changing the entire fleet.
StreetScooter has been active on Germany’s roads since 2014.
GfK leadership resigns after disappointing business figures
Consumer research company GfK is replacing its boss Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly, but not surprisingly.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK indicated that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann becomes all the more uncertain the longer the successes promised by him remain.
turbulence at the head of the Nuremberg market research company GfK: After disappointing business figures and the resignation of the company’s management, the world’s number five in the industry is facing a new beginning.
GfK CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board Arno Mahlert is already leaving the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
The management of the Board of Management took over the previous member of the Board of Management Gerhard Hausruckinger as early as 1 September, the company said.
He is to officially assume the function of a "Chairman" until a successor for Hartmann is found.
As a reason for the resignations, the company called "different views" on the long-term business policy orientation.
A company spokesman didn’t want to mention details on Friday.
Who will lead the market research company in the future is still unclear.
Investor circles said on Friday that the shareholders had recently been disappointed by the continued lack of success of the restructuring initiated years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the top of the GfK since 2011.
"The fruits of restructuring are not yet visible even after 5 years," it said.
Given the last bad GfK business figures, each shareholder will become restless at some point.
“If this were the case with BMW, the Quandts would do the same,” it said.
After setbacks in the previous quarters, the company had not been able to stop its loss journey in the second quarter of 2016.
At EUR 361.2 million, sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable quarter of the previous year.
With respect to the first half of the year, sales decreased by 3.4 per cent at EUR 721.2 million.
Profits in the second quarter have mainly impacted the company’s declining value in view of its difficult economic situation.
The corporate depreciation of 139 million euros, which became necessary in the Consumer Experience business unit, resulted in a loss of 148.2 million euros to the Group.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK generated a consolidated profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus slips into crumples in trenches: Eight injured
In an accident involving a coach with 43 seniors as passengers, eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummhörn (Aurich County).
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, police said.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach had to evade, according to her information, a counter-loader, which partly drove on the counter-rail.
The bus came to the right from the road and slipped into a ditch, as a spokeswoman for the Aurich/Wittmund police reported.
“Due to the location of the bus, people were unable to leave the bus independently,” she said.
The firefighters freed the inmates.
Six ambulances and one ambulance arrived at the scene of the accident on Landesstra<0xC3><0x9F>e 2.
The uninjured travellers were taken back by a bus to the Krummhörner district of Pewsum.
There they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
The investigators asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
From 1 October 2016, the fees per cubic metre of waste water for the Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl wastewater treatment plant will be EUR 3.44 instead of EUR 2.10; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp EUR 3.36 (previously EUR 2.26) and for Azendorf EUR 3.64 (previously EUR 2.18).
At the plant in Azendorf, the waste water charge will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures become necessary.
After a comprehensive calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic meter.
As Mayor Bernd Steinh<0xC3><0xA4>user (CSU) reported, it was found during the approval of the budget by the Landratsamt Kulmbach that shelters for these wastewater treatment plants are running.
Due to legal bases, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the plants in a cost-covering manner.
From 1 October 2016, the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial enterprises from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the budget.
The fee increases range from 48 to 67 percent.
As Chief Administrative Officer Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the Board, a recalculation of the fees was necessary for the waste water facilities of the market community.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or under-coverings from the previous calculation period should also be compensated.
Schmidt explained that all three wastewater treatment plants are relatively small facilities with a very low waste water consumption, which is between 6800 and 12,000 cubic metres per year.
Due to the low distribution basis, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious effect.
In addition, the amount of waste water in all three plants was slightly reduced.
Furthermore, in the past calculation period all three plants had incurred a considerable amount not least due to their age of refurbishment and repair costs.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage in the Azendorf wastewater treatment plant.
At the Welschenkahl pumping plant, the almost 20 year old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground up and at the Lopp pond sewage treatment plant, after almost 20 years of operation, the first sewage pond had to be dred out, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation possibility was installed in order to be able to comply with the water regulations in the future.
Schmidt: "These extraordinary expenses resulted in the continued maintenance and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account accordingly in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which were still significantly below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Steinh<0xC3><0xA4>user made it clear that in the case of the small waste water attack in the three plants, the costs for the operation and maintenance "pervade fully".
Schmidt added that the market community has been spared from major entertainment costs in wastewater treatment plants over the past 20 years.
According to Steinh<0xC3><0xA4>user, the situation for these plants will continue to be precarious in the long run, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal Wastewater Association could not be extended by these plants because they are deficient facilities.
Bulgaria: first time in 8 months inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first over zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% were booked.
The annual average inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%, measured according to the CPI.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained unchanged as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; apartments, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communications; and education.
Snapchat "Anime" Effect Criticized as Asian Caricature
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it’s insensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders on absurdity.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog, or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are untamed, feature-twisting tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All missteps come to the public.
Snapchat filters have attracted criticism in the past, in which they were accused that the Blackface app would promote or promote white skin as a beauty ideal.
This week, when some users suggested a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth, and bloated cheeks, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asians – “yellow face.”
They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and outrage were widely circulated on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced it would have disabled the feature.
The company offered an excuse: the filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as a cartoon of Asians.
But outsiders who experienced racism reminded the filter of hurtful clichés.
Others strongly rejected the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets about the photos became widespread, wrote that the filter was "injurious and gentle, to say the least, unpleasant."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian cartoon and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow-face has been drawn into the devaluating extreme.
Snapchat isn’t the only company that crosses this cultural barbed wire.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat’s large audience of young people — who are more diverse in race than their older counterparts — might be more likely to expect sensitivity.
When one of Snapchat’s filtering creates an image that is offensive to a user, “it’s much more difficult for such things to remain unnoticed than it used to be,” 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account, prompting others to do the same.
In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believes race-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in Snapchat’s hiring practices.
Zhu criticized the mostly white male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
“Either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so they can make such decisions,” said the Chinese-American Zhu, “or they have people with other skin colors who work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say anything against it.”
Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but, according to a spokesperson, the company recently hired a personnel manager who focuses on underrepresented population groups and on internal integration efforts.
Zhu, for her part, said that she will leave her Snapchat account closed and added, “I wonder if they need more users like us to be able to say that’s not OK.”
Military leadership falsify ISIS intelligence, Congress committee notes
Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than would have allowed the actual conditions on the ground, a congressional inquiry committee reported in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, prepared by a task force of the Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Military Budget Committee, reports of great discontent among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, for short, Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"News service information typically nicked by high-ranking Centcom commanders regularly drew a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism than it would have allowed the actual conditions on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis of other news services," a newspaper article quoted the report.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership flaws in Centcom reach the top of the organization.
The ten-page report details persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.
Although there is no direct indication that Obama’s top government leaders have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their pre-laws to draw a more optimistic picture of the Islamic State’s threat, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
“During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than they were in line with the facts,” the report noted.
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city, remains under Islamic State control.
"After months of investigation, so much is clear," Republican Congressman Mike Pompeo of Kansas said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the Central Command’s leaders changed intelligence reports to downplay the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans launched the Task Force after it was admitted that analysts were concerned about manipulating reports on the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings as the investigation continues.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defence are ongoing.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
“In 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an excessively restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services,” said Adam B. Schiff, the highest-ranking Democrat in the committee, in a statement.
This process, Mr. Schiff said, “delayed the publication of intelligence reports,” damaged morale among analysts and “gave excessively little room for dissenting opinions.”
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they had found no evidence of White House intervention among Centcom analysts regarding a “certain political opinion.”
The preliminary results of the Congressional investigation were published by The Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported on investigations by the Pentagon’s Inspector General, which were admitted after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press secretary, stated in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on congressional reports while the Inspector General’s investigations are still ongoing.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the defense ministry welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense."
The investigation has repercussions beyond the question of a successful US-led air campaign in Iraq and Syria (a claim now made by a growing number of members of the Department of Defense).
However, last year’s accusations raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
Criticism of intelligence about the Islamic State recalls disputes from more than ten years ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a paper on how the then-government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, only provided a small crew in Iraq and spent little time pondering the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting on the Islamic State.
Last year, the team around Mr. Hooker, according to government agencies, found that, contrary to the government’s statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would not have a significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market.
However, this finding was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at Central Command.
The U.S. wins fourth match in women's field hockey, a showdown with Britain is imminent
One day after scoring three goals during a 6-1 win over Japan, Katie Bam also scored the first two goals for the American women's field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won by 3-0.
Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she couldn’t remember ever having done that.
"I have no idea," she said.
I'm not one of those people who keep their gates in mind.
However, she knows this: the American women are 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are in first place in their group with the British, who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two within their group of six teams will win first and second place respectively.
The first-placed will go a little further out of the way for the strong Dutch women, who lead the other group.
However the game may end on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising vortex through their success story, four years after they landed in the last of 12 places at the past London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time at the age of three had a hockey bat in her hands (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), at the age of 16, she became a U.S. national player, the youngest in the team's history.
She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the squad.
Then came the year 2012, when everything went wrong for her and her team.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became the coach of the national team and things began to turn around for the better.
“A cultural change, a mental change, and a physical change,” Bam said.
We didn’t have the work curriculum in London that we have now.
We were able to pull the rudder around completely.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a close-up handshake.
India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament, but the team turned out surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game in their hands.
She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled into the middle and flung the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The shutout was the first of the entire tournament for the goalkeeper of the United States, Jackie Briggs, who had to score a goal in each of the previous games so far.
She has a run.
Just like Bam.
“We’re in a good position,” Parnham said, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.
Amid the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampoline
Wherever you are, however late it is, it is the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a fast paced relay run between competition and pursuit.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is passed from the crossbow shooter to the swimmer to the gymnast to the triathlete.
You can’t turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor’s conversation in the queue at the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is the first time at the Olympic Games and is a woman's swarm of murky, could well have been among those well-known names sent to Prime Time, built up by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising if he was a swimmer, gymnast or even a fighter.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline tour.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event the same.
Further from the center, some in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognized: air gun shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breast swimming and may it reign for a long time.
But if I should make modest arguments for my particular favorite, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it made its debut in Sydney, it has been perceived so sparsely for the past 16 years that many of the people I interviewed didn’t know it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the U.S. sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and had an athlete until 2012 who managed it until the final round.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
Trampoline jumping has a certain exterior charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unexplained ear for a clown school than the one for the Olympic Games.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but just an earthbound enthusiast.
It has humorous potential - the cardboard-like tremor of its never-ending impact - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that unite it essentially.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as "jumpboard."
Emerging winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a series of falling movements (turns, pike and saltos) before landing on their feet.
They are evaluated according to the official Olympic program according to execution, difficulty level and "flight time".
Twenty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight.
Medal hopefuls have to go further, faster, up and over in their pursuit of gold, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.
They not only hunt the finish line or the starting wall, but also another heinous goal in television transmission: that of the world or the Olympic record.
The purposeful pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical – and it’s enough to even stir a spectator to tears.
But it’s also what I find a bit tiring when I watch these games.
The trampoline offers a breath of fresh air.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is at the top.
Moving forward is not the goal.
He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
Here too there is competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolfing into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It is as zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be.
The women’s qualifying and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in the streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men’s on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days starting at 2 p.m.
In the midst of the Olympic Mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general tumult.
If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by admitting and objectifying male athletes – as the male U.S. gymnasts recently suggested, according to The Wall Street Journal – then Mr. Dooley is expecting his airborne new fan base.
"A generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia met with violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say tens of protesters were killed during clashes with police during gunfire.
Is Ethiopia about to collapse?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa’s most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets demanding fundamental political changes.
The government’s response was relentless, according to human rights organizations.
Witnesses said police officers shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.
Videos circulating about the protests, which are probably from the last or early of this year, show how security officials beat young people with sticks while forcing them to make a handstand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Agency is now calling for an in-depth investigation.
“It has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.
U.S. military and intelligence agencies are working closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats across the region, especially in Somalia. Few countries in Africa, if any, receive so much Western aid.
Ethiopia’s economy expanded at a considerable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia was anything but a model of democracy – human rights organizations have consistently led the repression by the government – the opposition in the country was restricted, effectively silenced dissidents.
Many were sent to exile or to prison, killed, or driven into the vastness of the desert.
But that could change.
"If you oppress people and they have no other options besides protesting, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia.
The entire youth protested.
One generation protested.
There are numerous complaints covering everything from the use of land to the crackdown on the power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies won the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament.
At the same time, tensions rise along the border with Eritrea; a struggle for this tacky, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who have been more or less conquered in recent years, could exploit the turbulence and arm themselves again.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of simmering under the surface are now exploding.
The first one seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years, very many Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more common and the Internet services have improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially during protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are staying.
Several young Ethiopians indicated that they were gathering to protest in this way.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since Aeons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia’s predominantly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economy, while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in flat-land areas.
But that also changes right now.
"We are coordinating under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The largest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, who make up around 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death from an undisclosed illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.
Analysts say he was particularly versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special agents to deal with opponents and make them harmless.
“The current regime lacks this basic skill,” said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a riot was in 2005 after thousands protested against elections, which, according to analysts, were apparently suffocated by the government and subsequently stolen.
During the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed, even if it was less than in recent months and this time of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia’s leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction.
But obviously, this has not prevented the intensification of the Ethiopian government’s internal disapproval.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters attacked Gondar, an Amharic city, led by Tigray, and the hatred towards the Tigray is becoming more common on social media.
Analysts say the protests put the US and other Western allies in a strange position.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights across neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced that it had closed that base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin ridge walk."
Donald Trump declares Obama’s claim that he founded ISIS was “sarcasm”
Donald J. Trump on Friday tried to disperse the last controversy surrounding his campaign by stating that his multiple-repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State terrorist group was not meant to be serious.
This clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehensibly with the American public.
It also brings his fellow contenders, who seek to protect him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he could not have meant at all.
After making the suggestion at an election campaign event on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump rowed back in relation to the allegation on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.
The tweet was in contrast to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he thought the accusation was completely serious.
When conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate didn’t want to know about it.
The last storm of criticism is pounding down on Mr. Trump as he tried to direct the focus of his campaign to the economic situation due to falling survey values.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton spoke about the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump again tried to return to this issue.
Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton’s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already presented sarcasm to his defense.
At the end of July, he drew strong criticism when he thought the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained "Of course I meant that sarcastic".
This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then to row back as needed.
“I think it’s one of his methods of testing how certain messages are recorded by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary, “clarifying” depending on how the reaction is going to turn out,” said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who watches the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of denigrating the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more corrosive tone as his poll scores have declined further.
A new poll by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, released Friday, showed a lead with a big lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado, and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But while he is increasingly focused on attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump’s jokes have put his loyal associates in the uncomfortable situation of having to stand up to him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump’s most prominent advocates, made great efforts to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday.
"I believe what he says is legitimate political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, questioning the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statements as to whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It is true, in this sense, that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbenchmen, completely wrong, and that is why it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread by failing to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East.
Before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of riding around on each of his words and being biased against him.
He taunted the “poor, miserable” television experts trying to understand him and said, “You can’t!”
Some Democrats ridiculed Mr. Trump’s apology as just another proof that he was unfit for the presidency.
Once displaced by the price of the market, Café in Greenpoint comes back
Verb Cafe was a shabby café in Williamsburg where you could only pay cash that didn’t have Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices were pushed out of his Bedford Avenue storefront.
The Soap Cherie store, which replaced the verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is changing, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is exempt, and Verb is now a soap business."
But if New York is change, then it is also reinvention.
A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similarly simple atmosphere.
Coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old café, who is the owner and managing director of the new café.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a client offered him to provide funds for a new outpost, he was excited to do so, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment too.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes such as capers and sautéed onions.
There are natural rice bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, but there are fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.
"Many old customers were also displaced by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take the road.
After the verb closed, she gave up coffee drinking for a while, she said.
“I realized that it was in the verb that I liked about coffee and culture,” she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even if she ordered a Blended Chai Tea instead of her usual Iced Coffee on that day, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work and inevitably always ordered the same thing.
“I came quarter after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they’re preparing my everything bag with butter,” he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and include new ingredients in the menu.
Nowadays Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he replaces his everything-ball with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he didn’t have a grudge about the soap business taking over the old business space.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for verb with the cold-brewed coffee of the café as an ingredient.
"I think we're still going to respond to their offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have also accepted the café.
A new customer translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he intends to exhibit it soon so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local juice shop wants to fill and sell the cold-brewed coffee in bottles.
There is a chance that the café will expand onto a neighboring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like a homecoming.
“I had to smell it,” he said.
The Depressing Food of the Economic Crisis in “A Rich Meal”
In March 1933, shortly after his rise to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a penchant for refined Fifth Avenue delicacies such as P<0xC3><0xA2>te de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu on that day was slightly more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato puree and as dessert a plum pudding.
“It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people,” said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to Americans how to eat."
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coe’s last book, “Chop Suey,” was about Chinese cuisine in the U.S., while Ziegelman, in her book, “97 Orchard,” talks about living in a home on the Lower East Side from a food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, “A decent meal,” which will be published by Harper Publishing on Tuesday, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at Eisenberg’s Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, no-frills snack in the Flatiron District that has been in business since the stock market crash of 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olives, while Coe, 57, ate turkey with potato puree and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered Hackbraten, the couple found this appropriate for a discussion about eating in the era of the Great Depression.
“Real foods were very popular,” Ziegelman said.
There were peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.
Coe grinned.
“It must have lay in the stomach like lead,” he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pasta was served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. "A Square Meal" records the ways in which the country bypassed being no longer the Schlaraffenland.
“It was a time when food became a central, tense topic for the Americans,” Coe said in a statement, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as strained: mysterious foods such as breads and cash rolls became basic foods, reusing the cash roll as a "wonderful way to recycle food residues," Ziegelman noted, as chefs were able to hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry fruit.
Meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a rarely served luxury.
Unique blends were tried, as high-calorie and nutritious gratification took precedence over taste or even healthy kitchen sense.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, brickman prepared a dish from this era, baked onions with peanut butter.
“It wasn’t a popular addition at lunchtime,” Coe says.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions do not match each other.
It was typical for many of the household recipes.
Like never before or ever since, householders – including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 – fueled the country’s eating habits in such a way.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "housewives" and meet the challenge of turning Pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical treats.
Particularly tasty are the reports of the government’s response to the starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover’s Lass-Mich-Kuchen-Essen attitude.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he fed like the million-dollar man of the world to whom he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate in an almost gold-plated dining room and wore a smoking.
He was a wonderful stranger to reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to set an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, hiring a housekeeper with no interest in flavours by Mrs. Roosevelt led the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most restless prepared.”
Many of the species from the Great Depression era to deal with food were discarded as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food, Ziegelman said, as well as on how science was applied to food.
The couple stated when writing the book that they had better understood the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law - for example, how she could not throw away food.
"She had a real fear of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "She actually made people sick."
There was the windbag incident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, they and Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate at noon.
"It's called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman, adding that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes a fancy name.
There was no beaten cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon in the tough, brown glibber.
Amazingly, it didn’t taste bad.
Coe picked up a note three times.
Like a can-do budgeter, he said to his wife, "A few chopped walnuts would help."
Killed in bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life at risk to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save others’ lives.
The 30-year-old has died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group that, according to Bild-Zeitung, saved nearly 60,000 people's lives so far.
2,900 volunteers risk their own lives to pull people out of bombed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the Civil Protection Officer showing him on an 11-hour rescue of an infant from the rubble of a house went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a shining symbol in the horror of war.
As a hero, however, he never saw himself, according to the picture, "For me, this is the real jihad."
"When I die saving lives, I think God sees in me a martyr."
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the last bombings in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one filled with chlorine gas.
One woman and two children died, seven people suffering from respiratory distress.
"We are now eliminating the bomb's toxic remains so that children don't play with it," the picture quoted his last words before he died.
The Assad regime’s deadly bomb was supposed to hit terrorists.
Greenland shark: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.
This shark was allowed back to the sea after an investigation aboard the Sanna research vessel.
He was born in 1624 and swims at a good 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - to this day.
Greenland sharks only get offspring at 150 years old.
The Greenland shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, an average of just 1,220 meters in an hour.
Only when it matters, the five-meter-long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km/h - and is at this top speed half as fast as a seal.
However, this lifestyle, characterized by slowness, seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the scientific journal "Science" at least of a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.
"Wisdom," comments Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, this lifetime, which means a world record for vertebrates.
The evolutionary biologist had long suspected that Greenland sharks would become stony.
But the evidence was lacking.
Greenland sharks are hard to observe, after all, they live mainly in the ice sea off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually only show up on the surface in winter.
Researchers know very little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.
They measured their slow pace when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitsbergen.
In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, while another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.
They may be hunting sleeping animals or patrolling at the bottom of the ice bucket and looking for carcasses that tumble down from higher water layers.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sharks that brought fishermen from Greenland or Spitsbergen from the depths of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest was 502 centimetres.
In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens core of the sharks using the carbon-14 method.
This center of the eye lens is created even before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it will not be renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had a striking amount of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons tests hurled larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In the third-smallest animal at 220 centimetres in length, the lens core, on the other hand, contained a small excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests, so it was likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in its 2012 investigation.
All the larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 levels in their lens cores, which are caused by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493 centimetre-long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimetres is likely to be even 392 years old.
The fact that Greenland shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters was known.
Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably at the threshold of sexual maturity and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks with the propagation obviously allow at least one and a half centuries of time.
This is also a world record for vertebrates.
The fact that such methusalems mainly live in icy waters is not a coincidence.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale with a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was also caught off Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often also runs on saving flame.
So they mature later - and age slower.
In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals often become particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much greater than that of a gram of elephant.
Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.
“A smaller animal lives more dangerously and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible,” explains evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should rather invest its resources in a long life.
Building land in a double pack
In the most recent meeting, the municipal council focused on topics related to building.
With relief, the panel noted the announcement by Mayor Robert Putz that "finally the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can begin".
After the land, parcelling and development questions were clarified and the applications for surveying could be made, the sale of the land in the residential areas "Stra<0xC3><0x9F>lweg" and "Schönau-West" (area Binderstra<0xC3><0x9F>e - expansion section 1) to interested parties is no longer in the way of selling the land.
The municipal council is convinced that the construction sites in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau appeal to young families and restful seniors alike.
As it said, construction workers can now report to the town hall, about the allocation of the parcels, the municipal council is expected to advise in its September meeting.
In order to be able to comply with requests for the establishment of other commercial enterprises, together with the creation of jobs, the municipal council decided to amend the land use plan, which was newly created in the spring of this year, in sub-areas.
For example, in the area of Unterzeitlarn, the commercial area already designated there is extended by two parcels towards Staatsstra<0xC3><0x9F>e 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
In competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg, the city of Main has the best chance of attracting jobs and companies relocated from London.
“It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote,” says Michael Voigtl<0xC3><0xA4>nder, head of the IW’s financial and real estate markets competence field.
According to the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses can continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU.
For the so-called EU passport, they have until now been admitted to the UK.
This is what big U.S. banks are using.
Several banks have already announced that they will relocate jobs.
The lobbying association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10,000 new jobs at Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, according to the IW, the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB), which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the eurozone, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisor EIOPA and the ESRB.
While the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters in Paris, it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
“The proximity to the central bank is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with the supervisory authorities,” says IW Professor Voigtl<0xC3><0xA4>nder.
Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry, but, like Dublin, it cuts down on infrastructure.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
Furthermore, the city scores points with easily available commercial properties.
“In Paris, it’s not that easy to find free high-quality offices,” Voigtl<0xC3><0xA4>nder says.
At the Seine, the rents for first-class commercial properties are 50 percent higher than at the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime.
In a ranking of Mercer’s management consultancy, the city ranked seventh, Luxembourg ranked 19th, Dublin ranked 33rd, and Paris ranked 37th.
Even though quality of life is a matter of preference: “With its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors,” the IW concludes.
However, despite the Brexit vote, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, according to economic researchers.
According to figures from the Landesbank Helaba at the end of 2015, around 144,000 people worked in the banking sector in London, while in Frankfurt it was 62500.
Gilead receives legal costs from the Hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. District Court ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement of the legal costs incurred by it from the Hepatitis C litigation with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was exempted from a $200 million compensation payment for the violation of two Merck patents related to Gilead's blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni after a U.S. judge uncovered a pattern of misconduct on Merck's part, including perjury and other unethical acts.
On Thursday, U.S. Attorney General Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead was entitled to issue the costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck is trying to equate Gilead with the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed ownership of laboratory work based on Sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead’s drugs.
US-backed troops say they have regained full control of Manbij from the Islamic State
U.S.-backed troops have regained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last ISIS fighters in the city left it, a group spokesman said on Friday.
The democratic forces of Syria (DKS) are currently combing through the city after the withdrawal of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city.
They have freed over 2,000 civilians held hostage by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish told DKS ally Manbij Military Council Reuters.
“The city is now under complete control, but we are just doing clean-up work,” he told Reuters.
Clintons make 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, yielding for the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband an income of $10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton raised nearly $5.3 million in speech fees; the former Secretary of State reported an income of $3 million from Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure in the State Department.
Clinton’s vice-presidential candidate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife Anne Holton, has been publishing his tax returns for the past ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency," Clinton campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In a stark contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and retractors regarding his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although they are not required by law to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by the tax authorities as the reason for his refusal.
"They're on the move," Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams wrote on Twitter, regarding the release of the Democratic presidential candidate.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump’s special counsel, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything until the tax audits are not completed.
Trump’s critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, have already made it clear that his refusal raises questions regarding wealth, his donations to charitable organizations, his business conduct, and various other connections, particularly with Russia.
Clinton has already fallen on the subject and released a video on the Internet on Friday, in which high-ranking Republican Trump is calling for his tax return to be released.
On Thursday, she also addressed the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax returns," she told the crowd.
Politico reported that Trump paid no or very little taxes during the 1990s for two years, and an economic journalist from the New York Times quoted a number of tax attorneys and tax advisors on Friday, stating that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that people who earn more than $1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During an election campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is based here, called for Trump to attend a meeting to exchange their tax returns.
Buffett said he had also been subject to a tax audit by the IRS and Trump had “fear” in front of the voters and not in front of the tax authorities.
Clinton’s campaign has been tax-declared since 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid on average an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The 2015 Clinton tax return showed that they only raised $100 of their income as wages, unlike the majority of all Americans.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which the Clintons taxed dividends and revenues of $109,000.

Condoms with chili powder, fireworks promote Tanzania's elephant protection
Nature conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going to human-inhabited settlements – they throw condoms on them filled with chili powder.
The method has proven effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea for it years ago, has intensified its funding together with the U.S. nature conservation by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-stage method to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Previously, many spears have been used to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to animal welfare.
“Since we developed the toolkit, we have been able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities, with much more confidence that they can keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephant,” said the CEO of Honeyguide Damian Bell in a statement.
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn.
If it is not deterred, a so-called "chili cloud" is thrown.
Chili powder mixed with soil is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom, the end of which is turned to the ignition line.
When it is lit, the condom pops up with a bang and sprays fine dust on chili powder into the air.
A breath is usually already quite enough to chase the elephant.
One last possibility is a thrower who shoots a gold-rained firecracker into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City Council unanimously decides: No Kiosk new building on the St. Goar river bank
Normally, St. Goar’s investment projects are accepted by traders with a kiss hand – but the retail sector in the core city is considered to be significantly expandable.
However, the City Council unanimously rejected the request for the new construction of a sales kiosk on the Rhine bank in the immediate vicinity of the Rheinbalcony under construction.
"Basically, we welcome new traders, but at this location in an exposed location on the banks of the Rhine, this kiosk does not fit," explained Michael Hubrath to the CDU faction.
Jewish director smashes Berlin hotel because Israeli pre-election was removed after "Arab" call - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media uproar after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli pre-election, as it had “requested” Arab guests, according to an employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah" left out his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel’s country pre-selection list.
However, the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center.
Looking for an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The response he received there “shocked him,” as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said the measure was "a deliberate decision by the management of Kempinski Hotels."
The reason behind this was even more anger in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the area code be deleted," Lanzmann's employee was quoted as saying.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a “great shame,” reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were horrified and disturbed by this event.
That's really very embarrassing.
The fact that this has happened in Germany in this particular hotel chain is an even greater shame.
This does not require any explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw "the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident sparked quite a big response on the Internet, in which people called the whole thing a scandal.
Some alleged to the Kempinski Hotel that it had "given up" the alleged calls of Arab guests.
"You are ashamed," it said in another post, pointing out that the hotel located on the noble Kurfürstendamm stands near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly dismissed all the accusations and called the incident an "accident" and "excused" at Lanzmann, reports Der Spiegel.
"There was never a direct instruction to not include Israel in the quick-election list," the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country code has now been added.
Police use tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms to the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to drive the students apart, causing the police to use rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their dismay at the plans.
According to the proposals of the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, just under 100 public schools are closed, while 300,000 students are implemented to save money.
Some of the protest participants were seen spraying graffiti against the provisional president Michel Temer on walls.
The latest protests took place a few days after protesters went to the streets in crowds to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate for her removal.
Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent year-on-year.
Since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted, the interest on Russian companies in business in the country has increased sharply, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are connecting with Iran, while new companies are ready to gain access to the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,” Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that trade turnover between Russia and Iran rose by 70.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and stood at $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports into Iran rose by 91.5 percent by leaps and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade upswing was achieved through deliveries of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian foreign ministry issued around 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Furthermore, Iran reached the top 20 of the countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year are being broken,” he said.
At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes it will change.
"I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Witnesses wanted: Drinks market in Waldbröl befallen
A robbery has been committed on Thursday evening at Rewe XXL’s beverage market on the Gerberstra<0xC3><0x9F>e in Waldbröler.
Under the pretext of a firearm, three darkly dressed people who had disguised their faces demanded that the employee of the beverage market issue cash and then fled first on foot and then probably with a silver VW golf.
How much money was taken, the police do not tell.
The perpetrators are said to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters tall, so relatively small.
The beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Rewe market and poorly visible.
After the attack, the perpetrators must have run towards Gerberstra<0xC3><0x9F>e, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and fled from the gravel parking lot opposite the car park entrance with the silver car, possibly in direction B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who has made observations at the time (at 7.45 a.m.) related to the robbery should urgently report to the police.
Nagold: Play and have fun in summer time
Eight beautiful and happy days were spent by the children and young people of the social pedagogical day group/social group work of the Nagold Children’s Protection Association with their supervisors during their summer holiday in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quiet Freizeitheim Hardtw<0xC3><0xA4>ldle, the lively group was placed during the first week of school holidays.
Several full-day trips were on the programme.
On the one hand, it went to Bretten with the visit of the petting zoo.
On the other hand, to Maulbronn, where there was a special children’s tour in the world famous monastery.
The third trip took us to Pforzheim.
In the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the daily life and food of the Celts.
On the hot days, the group had fun at Lake Tiefensee in Maulbronn, which invited them to jump, swim and splash.
Culinarily, children and caregivers were pampered with their self-prepared body dishes such as the Sauren Sp<0xC3><0xA4>tzle, the Seebronner Pf<0xC3><0xA4>nnle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English-Breakfast and Tübinger Bolognese.
In workshops, beautiful jewels were created from pearls and stones or a Roman mill game was made from wood.
Other highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings at the fire and the final "Bunte Abend".
On the day of the return journey, the sun laughed and the children and young people returned home contentedly.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims to the Gate of Mercy
The ministers from the pastoral unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on their way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Four stages were managed together.
In order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage of all ministers in the next two years, St. Anna, the senior ministerial council, has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and the Bishop's City of Freiburg was finally chosen, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered with the gate of mercy at Freiburg's Münster open for this purpose.
16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligenzimmer set out.
In the evening before, the parish priest Storost sent out the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim crosses and granted the pilgrimage.
From Horb it was taken by train to the starting point Villingen, where there is also a Münster of Our Lady and thus the pilgrimage path from the Münster was started.
The individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and scripts.
But even on the road, the minis at field crosses, chapels or churches kept resting to sing together a song from a specially compiled pilgrim songbook.
The parishes of the local parishes were each available for the overnight stays.
At the stage destinations Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller ensured a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast.
On the second day we went over Furtwangen to Göttingen.
The next day, the stage to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous route, had to first descend around 500 meters in the heat and then climb again.
The well-earned reward in the evening was a shared barbecue at the Badweiher.
After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, we went on the final stage to Freiburg.
Visibly relieved and happy, the Minis arrived at Freiburg’s Münster in the afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy.
With a small impulse, God was thanked.
In the evening fair in Münster, the minis arrived at the pilgrimage destination were welcomed by co-operator Markus Obert.
After worship, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day there was still time for the Breisgau metropolis.
In the afternoon we went back to Horb by train.
In the end, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Schotte Callum Skinner storms home when Brite gets gold for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner rallied to fame last night in the men's team sprint at the Velodrom in Rio, when the British team defended the London 2012 title.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took on the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made himself his own. The young man made the legend proud when he stormed home to win a victory from New Zealand’s favourites.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after taking only a modest sixth place at the London World Rail Championships in March, despite Hoys’ resignation.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of driver Jamie Staff.
They did this in time when Hindes appeared.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Scotsman who has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won four years with Hoy - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was barely behind after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.
A change of strategy made up a large part of the transformation, with Hindes driving in a higher gear to slow him down and allowing Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy looked from his position as a BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they climbed to the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, “It’s a flattering comparison.”
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph at the side of Kenny and Hoys, Hindes admitted that after a weak start, he deliberately fell on the track.
He later withdrew this statement and there was no opposition from England’s rivals.
With such an overwhelming victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said, "It feels like with all the GB flags on the stand like London."
We have met as a team in the last three months.
We got away so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation that has won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrom.
With Kenny’s form, it is in the realm of possibility that he repeats Hoy’s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
That would mean for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (a seemingly sacred date for British sports; that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born) - a yield of six gold medals and one silver medal.
It was the same with Hoy.
Kenny is next in the sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, “I only enjoy this for the moment.”
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a bit lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four-kilometer race.
They arrived at the finish line in 3:51,942.
The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will certainly be the focus.
He had argued with commissioners before qualifying yesterday, when officials called him to measure his height.
Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in world record time in 4:13,260.
The GB team relies on its strong track cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a bunch of medals.
After a truly extraordinary portrayal of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were shut down.
Dramas took place in the background, according to the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying allegations, as well as the retirement of such greats as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the now legendary reputation of GB, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.
Future of Portland’s smelting plant questionable due to repeal of the energy contract
The future of Portland’s aluminum melt in Victoria – as well as hundreds of workers’ jobs – is at stake, as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus cancel all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company announced.
This step followed the government’s decision in Victoria earlier this year not to grant any further subsidies to operate the facility.
A 20-year subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs are at stake in the Alcoa facility in Portland.
No fewer than 2,000 jobs – directly and indirectly – could be at risk in the event of closure.
In addition, there could be domino effects, as the smelter consumes around 10 percent of Victoria’s total power generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the point Henry Schmelzerei, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
The Alcoa melting plant in Portland is losing money and is risking closure.
This step follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price of the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminum melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expects three more owners to cancel their contracts.
The facility is in the majority ownership of a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL expects the facility to continue operating in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity through the smelter," the company said.
AGL continued to say that the contracts were so-called "security transactions" that should have come into force as of November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will end in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL expects that the contracts will contribute to revenue in fiscal year 17," the electricity supplier said.
All potential effects on revenue on AGL as of GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong future markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL announced that it had already written off the value of the contracts in its annual closing of $187 million in "expectation of termination".
Alcoa said that the decision to book out the contracts does not affect the "ability of Alcoa... to run the smelter or to ensure the power supply to the smelter."
The U.S. company said it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have come into force from November of this year, even if it still owes a statement as to why it has resigned from the contract.
Analysts warn against the possible closure of the Portland Melting Plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economic conditions of the industry.
In reference to analysts’ statements earlier this week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes around 600 megawatts of electricity annually and Tomago consumes around 900 megawatts of electricity.
Should both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [power market].
And for us as a power producer, that would not be good," he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of US Vogue.
Kendall, Estee Lauder’s brand ambassador, who ran on Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
“In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry,” Kendall wrote.
The cover revealed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the ever-popular showbiz uncle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as they have planned a cover of their sister and that with a classic wend.
This represents the clichéd plot of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the phrase, "You thought we'd forgotten you?" with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a station at 8:00 a.m.), but Kris somehow had to let her other girls take part in that publicity.
With regard to the September issue of Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's big sister Kim may have beaten her in terms of the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on the show in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league in itself.
For Vogue, the September edition is the most sold edition of the year.
With a scope that is more like a picture book than a fashion magazine, the edition attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were advertising from the 832 pages of the waltz 615 pages).
The unveiling of his cover star is so eagerly expected that in the last two years images of the magazine have been leaked before the official announcement.
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, clearly more "celebrities that model" than "models that are celebrities" have been on the cover.
Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga was honored.
But even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the former category, she is in good company.
These celebrities aren’t related to famous people or reality stars or teens of today who know how to shoot a good Snapchat video (even if all of that applies to Jenner).
They are really talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, Jenner’s success doesn’t like everyone.
With her reality TV story, Jenner’s position in the fashion world was always a bit tense.
In June, former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid and called them "the pieces of the moment."
These feelings boiled up again when the news came out with Jenner’s appearance on the Vogue cover.
But riding around on the resentment seems to pass by at the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She is, in the truest sense of the word, a supermodel.
She runs for Marc Jacobs.
She advertises your foundation of Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, she can be seen on Reality TV, probably just to see her sister Kourtney and her children.
Municipal law centers expel 160,000 people annually
More than 160,000 of the country’s aid needs are rejected annually by municipal law centers, while the industry is focused on the impact of further cuts in funds on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly people, immigrants, workers in need, victims of violence and those who do not have funds for unfair de-registration and the like - are already denied free legal advice and legal assistance when they apply.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already over-utilized, are preparing for further cuts.
From June next year, it is planned that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
Queesland’s director of community law centers James Farrell said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Law Centers found that thousands of people are already being rejected each year.
Farrell said the situation would only get worse without a repeal of the federal government’s decision.
“Queensland’s community law centers are chronically underfunded, which means thousands of people are turned away from important services they need,” he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with uncontrollable and oppressive debts, families who go through separations, workers who have been unjustly dismissed - all these people have legal problems and this survey shows that they can't get the help they need.
As of June 2017, the federal government will cut funds by 30 percent, which means that thousands of more vulnerable people from Queensland will be forced to deal with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Attorney General and Federal Minister of Justice as well as Queensland Senator George Brandis to remove these cuts immediately, so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raising funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of community law centers and their customer communities, and that the government is investing in this important work.
Donald Trump election campaign charged after employee allegedly pulled gun
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign has been charged with alleged inaction after she was told that her campaign leader for North Carolina directed a gun at an employee in February while traveling in a jeep.
The incident is described in an indictment filed Wednesday in Charlotte’s state court by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini stated that he had waited months for the matter to be settled internally before realizing that "this would not happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "took a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and rammed the run in Vincent's knee," Bordini said in his indictment.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign management, Bordini noted that at least four other people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the indictment.
"Weapons don't have to be fired to do damage," Bordini said.
The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate sparked a riot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment People" - gun owners and gun friends - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and appoint judges.
Trump’s campaign made it clear that the media had ripped his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.
Bordini’s complaint demands damages from the campaign for violating the duty of care and Philip for bodily injury and permanent mental damage.
Trump's spokesman Hope Hicks was unable to reach a statement.
Attempts to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news station in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer an employee of the campaign.
Calls to his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services, were not answered.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has led a controversial campaign so far.
The trial is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Survey before country elections: SPD and CDU lose
In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), significant losses are recorded for the ruling parties SPD and CDU.
This resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild"-Zeitung (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition in the north could barely continue to govern, according to the polls in Berlin, this is not possible.
In both federal states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and thus would have good chances to continue to run the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the survey, the party was only just ahead of the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.
The third place is disputed between the left and the AfD.
The left came to 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented in the Landtag for the first time with 19 percent.
Despite slight losses, the Greens returned to the Schwerin Landtag by 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent).
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the Landtag with 3 percent each.
According to the survey, the SPD was only 23 per cent (2011 election: 28.3 per cent).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
They were still behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6%), but in front of the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7%).
The AfD would be represented in the House of Representatives for the first time at 14 percent.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, the pirates would miss the move as opposed to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator was launched.
The successors dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it wasn’t good in the hand either.
On the contrary, it was pretty clumsy.
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would be enough for about two high-resolution selfies today.
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came into stores exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age.
20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer trade fair Cebit in Hanover as a "office in the pocket format".
In fact, the new mobile phone could reach a lot for then standards: SMS and emails could be sent and received, also by fax was the communicator.
Even the access to websites was possible via HTML browser, albeit painfully slow.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be opened up similar to a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.
The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 euros.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany in 2015 was 392 euros.
No one could have imagined in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then, everything has been different.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The mobile phone division of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, eventually being sold to Microsoft and wound up.
The market now dominates providers, all of which came much later than Nokia.
Always and everywhere online, this is everyday life for a lot of people today.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices were sold, of which 555 million were sold on Samsung and Apple alone.
Global sales with the devices are around 400 billion euros.
In addition, the well-running businesses of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies are included.
An entire industry has developed around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007, when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone at Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an Internet communicator, all easily operated via touch screen.
Apple’s winning streak began, and today the iPhone is still the most important product in the company.
Nokia, Motorola, and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the oversight.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
The saying now has Apple and Asian providers like Samsung.
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.
On average, every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone.
“We all need to learn how to put the smartphone away,” said Janina Kugel, the Siemens Board of Directors responsible for personnel.
Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time.
England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was Heathrow’s biggest attraction, as it was back in 2012 in London, when we put a lot of effort into ensuring that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End.
And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for locals and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and end youth unemployment in the airport environment.
Just as they were ahead of us in London in 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of Heathrow’s expansion is too great.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be embarrassed on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question he asks.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many and not for individuals.
Enlargement is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion in scientific growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 – which was voted the world’s best airport terminal five years in a row, to the T2, which was built amid the two most frequented runways in the world.
Now they are ready to deliver a third runway, supported by <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London games were a huge success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time that we steer this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "cat and mouse game" regarding ad blocking
For companies that make money with online advertising come, according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to bypass ad blocking, a "cat and mouse game" equals.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blockers on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post announcing that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the coding regarding its ads to make it harder for ad blockers to detect which part of the page is advertising.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of back-and-forth battle between the ad-blocking open source community and the bypasses has been going on since the invention of ad-blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how alarming ad blockers have become for the industry.
According to a study by Pagefair and Adobe last year, around 200 million people worldwide use ad blockers; almost four times as much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84% of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
The company has targeted ad blockers on desktop PCs, as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook’s mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a spokesperson said.
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a sufficiently large share of revenue, so Facebook’s investment of such a step seems to be worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced it would update its “ad preference tool” to give people more control over their targeted advertising.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock’s new filters would be alarming because they would also block content on the site that is not advertising.
“For users, this is not a positive experience, so we plan to address the problem,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an email message.
Ad blockers are a blunt tool, which is why we have instead focused on developer tools like Ad Preferences to put more control in people’s hands.
Woman overrun in suspected suicide on Swiss highway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police call witnesses after a woman was hit by a highway in the early morning hours of Thursday in an alleged suicide of several vehicles.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman laid down in the dark "in an act of desperation" on the street and was hit by several cars, police said in Vaud.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 who was overrun by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, police said, urging them and any witnesses of the incident to report.
An investigation was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told the Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed.
Was a collision preventable?
That's something the prosecutor has to decide," Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases over the past five years show that drivers are not held accountable.
In each of the two cases - where a person was walking in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian is walking on the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of negligent killing after driving over and killing a man who was lying on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and has become unconscious on the street, the court heard.
The court found that the policewoman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- was driving in a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the street was a "completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus was probably once habitable, according to projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-tight atmosphere might have once had similar Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still slowly turned on.
The model also highlighted the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and protect it from rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
“In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its daily side of the sun for almost two months,” said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio.
This heats the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heat.
The result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than those of Earth today.
The model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution previously suspected by planetary scientists.
Although it was once probably habitable, Venus -- over the course of billions of years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen disappeared, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained -- the Venus, as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as coach of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, leading to a lack of co-determination in the team’s decision-making process.
Alternative President/General Manager of Colorado’s Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately look for a new coach.
“Over the past three years, I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination,” Roy said in a statement.
Over the course of the summer, I’ve been thinking a lot about how I could improve this team to give it more depth, what it needs and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the trainer and Vice President of Hockey Operations must be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have a right to co-determination when making decisions that affect the team’s performance.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who had hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contribution to the team.
“Patrick informed me about this decision today,” Sakic said.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
Roy was named the league's best coach during his debut season at the 2013-14 Avalanches as the winner of the Jack Adams Award.
He led the club to 112 points and first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Minnesota playoffs and missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the wild for a second Wildcard Spot in the Western Conference by five points.
As a Hall of Fame goalkeeper, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two plays with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, suspend strike
The labor struggles regarding the remuneration for North Sea oil workers will be suspended, while all the parties to the dispute will sit at the table for a new round of talks, negotiators said.
Strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were sporadically carried out on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute," the statement said.
We will hold some full-day meetings in the next few weeks, which will begin early next year to tackle the problems again.
The unions said their last strike, the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has cut rates to its North Sea contractors by around 9 percent this year due to negative market pressure.
The company’s rate cut follows a 10 percent decline for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional cuts give the company the space needed to get through the market downturn.
Shell, for its part, has dismissed thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries, as it streamlines its operations as a result of its mega-merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, an economic situation that had been exacerbated by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes that have taken place in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
“In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few,” he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the cluster of Pleiades
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the Pleiades' cluster of stars.
The new data help astronomers understand why stars in the cluster rotate at different rates and how the rotation periods are related to the formation of the planet.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other clusters of stars, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age, and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a press release.
The stellar cluster of the Pleiades is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in this cluster of stars, created around 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.
They are now turning the fastest.
At peak rotation rates, these maturing stars emit large amounts of star winds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots --.
The latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars are spinning slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, with larger stars turning slower than smaller ones.
“In the “ballet” of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars,” Rebull said.
Since the stellar cluster of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotational rates.
"The stellar cluster of Pleiades provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
There’s still a lot to learn about, like how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and so to speak hang their “dance shoes”.
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Pleiades, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star resigns
The tears ran from base to base at Alex Rodriguez faster than the U.S. baseball star in best days.
After his emotional resignation announcement, the 41-year-old pro will one last time wear the jersey of his New York Yankees on August 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays.
“I love this game and this team.”
"I say 'Goodbye' to both," explained the 14-time all-star game participant of Major League Baseball (MLB).
Three times, Rodriguez was voted the most valuable player in the league, and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signature under a ten-year contract has earned him $27 million annually since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will serve as a consultant and youth coach in the future - with full salary.
As a player, Rodriguez paid it back with performance for a long time.
With 696 home runs, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994–2000), the Texas Rangers (2001–2004), and since 2005 the Yankees, he has achieved some milestones.
With Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two more baseball players have similar values in the most important statistics.
However, the 41-year-old is not expected to be admitted to the Baseball Hall of Fame.
Because as successful as Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the square.
As early as 2009, the superstar admitted to "ESPN" to consuming banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was suspended for 211 games due to a entanglement in the so-called biogenesis scandal until the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is considered the prime suspect to have received performance-enhancing funds through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida for years.
After a legal dispute, the barrier was reduced to 162 encounters.
“The league might even have done me a favor for 2014 because I’ve been playing for 20 years without a break,” Rodriguez said.
Even his farewell days are not silent.
While many baseball legends once again received the big stage in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
"My job does not include a farewell tour."
"My job involves trying to win every game," Yankees coach Joe Girardi said.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and is said to be related to pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, got sympathy confessions from fans of the Yankee arch rival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod", the supporters sang in the 4:9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
2016 Olympic Games: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Caught: Due to a positive doping test, weight lifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland cannot start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
A successful athlete would have won a medal.
Before the seventh day of competition, the first official doping cases have become known at the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre hurdler Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and excluded in Brazil – right before the start of the already critically eyed athletic competitions, these news come to an end.
At Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide had already been detected last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.
The International Court of Sports CAS confirmed on Friday afternoon local time its exclusion from the Olympic Games.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had taken fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly, only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen would have participated in the trials over 50 m freestyle.
Chen has requested the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to open the B-Test and a hearing.
The national association takes the matter "very seriously and demands full cooperation from Chen in the investigations," Xinhua said in a statement: "We will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the verdict."
For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible, but the CAS is responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.
Also on the night of Rio, the news of the positive test at Danekowa sizzled through, the 33-year-old himself went on the offensive.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," this was "an incredible shock," she told Bulgarian TV channel BNT.
She is innocent, “the only explanation could be dietary supplements,” the athlete explained.
According to the report, the banned substance is intended to be the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekowa was provisionally suspended, according to BNT, the B-sample should have already been positive.
Bulgaria’s Prime Minister Bojko Borissov immediately spoke out with criticism of the athlete.
"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said, "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weight lifters from the chronically doping-laden nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case of "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympian in class up to 85 kg was tested positive for the anabolic steroid Nandrolone like his brother Tomasz three days earlier.
Both contest the intake, but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the athletes, Danekowa in particular is another serious blow to the reputation of the entire sport.
With the exception of systematic doping, the IAAF had banned the entire Russian team from taking off, and the runners-up Kenya also produced a lot of bad news in Rio.
In swimming, the past offenses in China also caused fierce clashes between the athletes.
Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harshly.
"Sun Yang pinks purple."
“When I see the podium above 200 m of freestyle, I want to surrender,” Lacourt said on French radio.
Sun was also at the center of an argument with Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and no respect for doping scammers," he said.
Sun had been tested positive for the stimulant trimetazidine at the Chinese Championships in 2014, but only had to sit down for a three-month suspension.
Data Claw: How perfide blackmail hackers their ransom
Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey of malware defense specialists, malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed in the past 12 months have been at least once, sometimes several times, victims of an attack with blackmail software.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of the companies were once the target of ransomware blackmail.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransoms demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to reuse the attacked systems and data.
According to malwarebytes, the perpetrators are increasingly specializing in attacks in corporate networks.
If they are successful there, the potential ransom to be blackmailed is significantly higher than for private users.
“We are currently witnessing a terrifyingly rapid evolution of malware,” Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski said in a conversation with the “world.”
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertising.
Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.
At first, private users were the target, but the switch to corporate attacks took place in recent months was terrifyingly fast.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: Once active on a victim’s computer, it searches specifically for recently modified files such as Word, Excel, or database files, as well as for archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and permanently delete the originals.
The software then presents the demands of the blackmailers.
In order to get the encryption code to the files, the victims have to transfer money – mostly in the form of the crypto currency Bitcoin.
But where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production is stopped.
Thus, the damage is higher if a ransomware hits.
Twenty-two percent of German companies reported revenue losses from ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt business, in one case people were at risk of life.
In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.
“We always say to the victims: Don’t pay, you only promote the problem,” explains Kleczynski.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay get their data back.
For managers, it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in the face of downtime in the company.
The hackers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure’s security researchers investigated the user interfaces and contact with the blackmailers and came to the conclusion that the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to raise more money.
They explain to their victims via chat how they can pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt sample files for free.
And if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies sometimes have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit amounts to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming more and more professional and share the work, security expert Chester Wisniewski of antivirus provider Sophos explains: “A single person can write a ransomware around within a week.”
However, it is more likely that they are three or four people.
The programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software kit to the actual blackmailers.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a one-time fixed price between $1,000 and $10,000.
“Included in the scope of delivery is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed,” says Wisniewski.
The blackmailers are then looking for more hackers to distribute the newly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service industry.
So you log into one of the forums in the underground, buy the set from a criminal and commission another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
“Usually, the criminals then commission spammers with the spread,” Wisniewski explains.
The risk of ransomware is now known to many companies that better secure their data.
More than 50 percent of company IT executives in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to fend off ransomware through file backups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
“If data encryption alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful scavenging, the perpetrators instead threaten to release sensitive data, such as customer lists or price calculations,” said Marcin Kleczynski, Malwarebytes’ chief executive officer.
Thus, depending on the type of data, the damage potential is still much higher than before.
In the future, the perpetrators could also take on completely new goals on the Internet of Things.
At the Defcon hacker conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, the activation of such a blocked heating system could well be worth a ransom for some victims.
If the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating it in the future, ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupe and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds pretty overloaded, but the HR-V, which was built on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the HR-V is only 1.60 m high, passengers have plenty of space in the first row as well as in the rear, it doesn’t seem tight anywhere.
The materials of the interior are well-processed and look pleasant, only the cockpit top falls slightly off.
More versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR-V at the storage room.
Not only is there a trunk of 453 l available with raised and 1026 l with folded backrests, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: The rear seat can be folded up like a cinema seat and thus offers storage space that is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.
The trunk can be loaded well, but the loading height at 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-litre diesel with 88 kW/120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully in wide speed ranges thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm.
However, he should do his work a little more quietly.
The daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km is pleasant.
There is another motorization: a 1.5-litre petrol engine with 96 kW/130 hp.
A four-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
But the steering should be a bit more direct.
The equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested top variant "Executive".
Safety systems include the City Emergency Brake Assist (working up to Tempo 32), the Collision Warning System and the Lane Keeping Assist.
The collision warning sometimes annoys because it evaluates many obstacles as "adjacent objects" when shunting.
The high-beam assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent tempo controller responds to traffic sign recognition and throttles the speed if needed.
However, the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touch screen, Navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI jacks are below the armrest and are therefore a bit cumbersome to reach.
The around 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top-diesel are fine.
If you don’t want to invest that much, you get the petrol from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro 6 emissions standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not liable: Fall on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
For liability is only conceivable in the case of dangers typical of air transport, the Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf argued (Az.: 18 U 124/14).
The plaintiff had broken a kneecap during the fall.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere – it’s a general life risk, according to the court.
The airline did not have to pay the man any compensation.
Disease case: When the organizer pays
After their trip, sick holidaymakers only get money back if the cause of the disease can be found in the hotel without a doubt.
However, this is only the case if more than ten percent of guests show the same symptoms.
In the case under negotiation, a family on the second day of their holiday in Turkey was severely affected by diarrhea and vomiting.
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room.
Their illness led the holidaymakers back to a defective sewage treatment plant, which allegedly had polluted the seawater.
The family felt that the trip was inadequate - and complained to the organizer.
The plaintiffs had no success in court.
The sewage treatment plant was indeed defective.
However, the organizer only learned about it shortly before the plaintiffs left.
Until then, he had to assume that the seawater was okay.
So he did not violate his information obligations, according to the verdict.
Especially since no impurities were found in the samples of the water.
The disease of several hotel guests - possibly due to infection with each other - is part of the general risk of life.
Of 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
De Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re said that after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were worried about further attacks.
The state must react thoughtfully and decisively at the same time to terrorist threats.
Our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not give this triumph to the terrorists.
However, if offenders had to leave the country faster, that would increase security and also strengthen the consent of the population for refugee policy.
De Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re wants to implement the proposals until the 2017 Bundestag election.
He also announced a further personnel reinforcement of the security forces, "on a medium four-digit scale over several years".
Sympathy advertising for terrorism must be re-punished.
Video surveillance should be improved, the gun rights should be levelled in such a way that, above all, the purchase of weapons on the Internet is made more difficult.
The most recently much discussed duty of silence for doctors is to be observed according to de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re’s words.
However, in dialogue with the medical community, he wants to look for solutions on how to reduce the threat to citizens, he said with regard to, for example, psychological abnormalities.
In order to counter the radicalisation of refugees, the minister considers better social care necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumatized people.
In order to prosecute criminals in special areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re plans to use covert investigators.
SPD chief executive Gabriel said: “The SPD is ready to talk about anything that helps to further increase security.”
It is important that the Minister of the Interior has clearly spoken out against actionism.
"This was a slap in the ear for the sharp-sharpeners in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel told the newspapers of the Funke Mediengruppe (Friday).
De Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re had previously rejected calls from the Union for a burqa ban and the abolition of dual nationality.
He considers a general ban on full veiling to be problematic under constitutional law.
You can't ban everything you refuse, and I refuse to wear the burka.
You can talk about rules, for example, in road traffic or for witnesses in court.
Green chief Simone Peter accused the minister of wanting to simulate the power and the ability to act with ever-new anti-terror packages.
Left-wing party leader Bernd Riexinger said: “Fleet Proverbs and a tightening of the right of residence no longer bring security to the people of this country.”
Better traffic flow on the highway feeder
It is regularly jammed on the bypass road - here is a picture of November.
However, this should change: the right-hand turn track should be extended.
This is good news for all motorists who are stuck in traffic on the surrounding road every evening when they drive over the highway (A 43).
The Landesbetrieb Stra<0xC3><0x9F>ebau will extend the track by 700 meters on Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August) in the area between Hammer Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e and the Weseler Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e exit.
Drivers can then thread directly from Hammer Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e to the right.
The big advantage is that traffic divides up earlier, improving the overall flow on the busy section of Bundesstra<0xC3><0x9F>e 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district representation Münster-West.
The narrowing of the road on the feeder is especially annoying for drivers between 5 pm and 7 pm.
On weekdays, the backstau extends all the way to the bridge over the Albersloher trail and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the needle hole on the B 51 just before the exit Weseler Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
From here, traffic is only directed one-lane via the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt well over a quarter of a year ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the required load capacity to accommodate heavy-duty traffic in two lanes.
How long this bottleneck and the associated daily work-related congestion will last can not be said by the competent national company.
However, years can be expected: because the bridge has an official rest period until 2034.
For the extension of the legal turnaround track, the state company has deliberately selected the weaker time during the school holidays, because disability is to be expected.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, traffic will pass by the construction site.
Intercultural travel: cultural offers for schools
The international class of the forest school visited the play "The Invisible House".
The association Nima's and the Junge Theater are now planning a music project.
The Nima's Association allows young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Klasse International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has visited an idea of the award-winning piece "Das invisible Haus" of the Junge Theater Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Journey" initiated by the Nima Association, 19 students between the ages of 11 and 15 attended the staging in the Kleine Haus.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Most of the young people in the class came to Münster from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria between September 2015 and March 2016 and speak little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic images and video animations, they were able to follow the course of action, according to the press release of the Junge Theater Münster.
The association Nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Junge Theater will work together in the upcoming season as part of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without a background in flight and migration between 14 and 20 years should be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the areas of singing, dancing, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language mediation are planned.
The project "Intercultural Travel" continues.
In view of the increased number of refugees, the association expects many classes to participate.
Rain instead of starbursts: hope for weather improvement
The weather has made a cut for the Sternschnuppen-Guckern in the southwest of Germany on Friday night - but there is still hope.
The night was poorly suited for observing the celestial spectacle due to clouds and rain, said the chairman of the Welzheim Observatory, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on Saturday night.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we will surely see many starbursts in the sky.
The constellations are Perseids, which are one of the fastest constellations at 216,000 kilometers per hour.
They have their name because they seem to come from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Relaxing Night: Tips for Preventing Sleep Disorders
In the evening you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning you can no longer think of sleep before the alarm bell rings.
This is anything but relaxing.
After all, one is in good company with such problems: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent often or permanently feel their sleep is not restful.
What are sleep problems or sleep disorders?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they can be caused by a variety of causes, stresses Hans-Günter Weess, member of the board of the German Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine Association.
What is commonly understood by this country is the insomnia, which is a sleep disorder.
Many people feel that sleep is unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the Board of Management of the German Association of Physicians with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.
What is behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Organic, psychological or behavioural factors may be present, but also medications may be present.
Not infrequently, the sleep disorder is an expression of another disease.
"Very early waking up is common, especially during depression," says Weess.
And it may be that different factors constrain each other.
For example, if you have a herniated disc incident, can be bad, wakes up every two to three hours and possibly starts grumbling about everyday problems and worries, Weest gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you go to the doctor with sleep disorders?
Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month for at least three nights a week and are affected during the day should go to the doctor, advises We<0xC3><0x9F>.
The impairment can look very different: one is relaxed, tired, unsleepy, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headache.
In order to alleviate the sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes.
Treatment options include behavioral changes, cognitive behavioral therapy, or even medications - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - are eligible.
There are hardly any depressed sleep physicians in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medicine center at Charité Universit<0xC3><0xA4>tsmedizin Berlin.
Therefore, in case of sleep problems, one should first contact the GP, advises We<0xC3><0x9F>.
He can explain with studies whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleep lab, and what happens?
For examination in the sleep laboratory, doctors advise, for example, snoring with respiratory arresters, sickly daytime fatigue, sleepwalkers or if you do not find the cause of a sleep disorder, explains Fietze.
You don’t really have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
“Just don’t sleep at lunch,” says Fietze.
After the wiring, you go to bed at its normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, one wears a nose glasses, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping person.
How can those affected get to grips with the problems?
There are quite a few adjusting screws that you can use for a better sleep.
Wee<0xC3><0x9F> counts on: regular bedtimes and getting up, not lying in bed for too long, not sleeping during the day, not watching TV to fall asleep, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start to expect immediately, and that is not at all conducive.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has expressed disappointment at the DSV team at Olympis via Facebook.
In December 2014, he won gold for the first time at the Doha Short Track World Championships, setting his first world record at the same time.
The former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has now turned to Facebook to protect himself from his ex-team colleagues in the criticism.
“In a country where an Olympic winner gets $20,000 prize and a jungle king $150,000, no one should be surprised about missing medals,” the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday.
The support system in swimming sports is poor, while the doping controls are very good.
This means that we cannot compete with countries that promote very much and do not look so closely or even operate on the subject of doping.
“I’m not saying the controls should be stopped here,” he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be notified nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
This is also the case with countries.

Airport: Gang of baggage thieves arrested
Professional Thieves at Dusseldorf Airport
On Thursday, Düsseldorf police officers arrested two women and two men between the ages of 50 and 61.
The suspects had committed several bag and baggage thefts as gangs.
Around 9.30 p.m., civilian officials in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognized a gang known to the police from past theft offences.
The two women and two men had committed several crimes since mid-July of this year and had taken part in the work together, in part and in a particularly professional manner.
The specialists of the Criminal Commissariat 34 can prove four acts to the thieves who had entered Germany specifically to commit crimes.
In total, they had captured more than 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few linden trees, in between still a remnant of cobblestones: at first glance Rigaer Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not act like this, but the police consider it one of the "dangerous places" of the city.
If you walk along the road from east to west, you will pass by playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a bio shop.
To the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade of a gray house someone sprayed "ugly!"
Compared to a Lidl, which will also be demolished soon, is already being built: by 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be built here.
However, articles about this "trendy district", as the relevant real estate company Friedrichshain calls, are preferred in recent weeks to be illustrated with burning cars.
Reason is the house with the number 94: Once it was occupied, now the residents have leases, but on the ground floor are still occupied rooms and are used for events.
In particular, Berlin's interior senator Henkel had repeatedly advocated a hard action by the police against the project since the beginning of the year, calling the area a "no-go zone" for police officers and the 94 as the starting point for autonomous violence.
After the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, were cleared with 300 police officers, police patrolled for three weeks, according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on site, blocked parts of the street and prevented visitors from entering the house with the number 94.
Meanwhile, on behalf of the unknown homeowners, construction workers renovated the rooms.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers withdrew under the cheer of sympathizers and residents.
This summer afternoon the road seems peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk in front of late.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.
Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in Kiez since 1999, and Jana*, who raises three children here, are especially annoyed by the police presence.
With the residents of the house projects, they share the concern for rising rents and gentrification.
It doesn’t sound like a kiez that most wanted police protection from vandalizing leftists.
The trench, which the Berlin intern senator and the police between house occupiers and their neighbors apparently does not exist.
Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which has a low average income and high poverty risk compared to the rest of the city.
House occupations and the resulting housing projects have long been part of the Kiez: in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e very close to the Rigas.
While the Mainzers had been cleared in a real street battle under a large police order, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and are still inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and pollsters from all over the world: with them now residents from GDR times and former home occupiers share their kiez.
This is also noticeable in the rents, which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 in the case of new rentals.
Many of the new buildings in the Riga region are attacked as symbols of this development: you can see them on thrown-in disks or freshly painted fa<0xC3><0xA7>ades, which have been cast with paint bags.
No other street was mentioned this year so often along with the words "left-sautonomous violence".
One reason why not all neighbors view this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crime such as bodily injury is almost exclusively directed against police officers, according to statistics.
Most of the crimes are property damage, which tends to affect the new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty.
As far as violence is concerned, it is appalling: the people in 94 are their neighbors, they certainly were not.
Even the famous burning cars no longer exist directly in the Riga area for a long time.
For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than anywhere else".
Neugebauer deliberately moved into Rigaer Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e - and remained.
That is why it was so important to her that the residents get their way back: from the police, the politics and the media, who all suddenly claimed the authority of interpretation over the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road is still taken away from them: through faceless new buildings in former building gaps that displace the old residents.
“In the end, these are condominiums that are not interesting for many here – people who are not so well stocked here are more likely to live here,” she says.
“I can’t approve of violence and destruction.”
But what to do if no one ever listens to you?
There is frustration on all sides, including with the police and the residents.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for the intruders who are annoyed by color bombs: the house projects and the left scene were part of the kiez.
Anyone who moves here should be aware of this – just like someone who moves to a pub district can complain badly about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee commissioner
Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer.
She is also a local social worker.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee representative for Urbach.
The social educator supports the management team for Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a point of contact for all actors: refugees, the Refugee Aid Working Group, administration, authorities and anyone else involved.
Regine’s client from the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the egg-laying wool milk sau, which has a problem above all.
For example, some had meant - less mockingly than rather targeting the multitude of desired tasks - when the administration wanted to write off the job.
An administrative specialist with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, was sought, namely an egg-laying wool milk sau.
But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it is about organization, working with the local people and also behind the scenes as well as networking.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
She has a 50 percent position limited to three years.
"It was high time," says Regine Kunde, that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and full-time actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.
Soon new containers will be in the Wasenstra<0xC3><0x9F>e
It has been a serious problem for some time to find housing for the refugees who have been recognized.
The municipalities are responsible for the accommodation.
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented dwellings.
The costs for the construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility changes from the Landratsamt to Kommune and Jobcenter.
Problem: There are free properties, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.
It doesn’t work until now, you need private homes, says Deuschle.
Therefore, communal dwellings must be cultivated, as it is so beautiful.
So new containers will soon be installed in the Wasenstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
But it is not done only with apartments.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a permanent stay, there are internships, training centres, school places, one-euro jobs and relief activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or set up.
“More seats would be good,” says Regine Customer.
Many work in the building yard or help caretakers, do non-profit work – and that’s motivated and very orderly, as Annika Deuschle reports.
She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect.
This is not “occupational therapy.”
But work is not just work.
The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People need to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So here too the administration and volunteers jump in.
It is crucial that the refugees feel that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the procedures is a problem.
They have to explain to the refugees that it is just taking time and they can bridge the time meaningfully, for example with language courses.
Those who at some point develop the feeling that they can't help anyone in Urbach, can't work and be useless, will never integrate.
The vast majority are motivated.
However, there are also problem cases, says the customer honestly, "people who can't do anything at all". The work of Deuschle and the customer is therefore always to motivate others.
All of this is a mammoth task.
A difficult question: Are the two afraid of radicalization after the recent events, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regine customer quite clearly, "what some may call naive", but a residual risk can and does not want to exclude it.
The helpers are already sensitized.
These incidents are also an issue for refugees.
They were afraid that the assassins would completely discredit them.
“They want to show that they have nothing to do with it,” says Regine Kunde.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
Thus, the main and volunteers must look for activities on site and in the region.
They always have in the background that soon a new push on refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.
Does Germany need an upper limit?
To answer this question clearly, the policy is afraid.
In fact, it is unfair to put them helpers on the spot.
"In Urbach we have not yet arrived where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine’s customer also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already used to integrating the previous people in a reasonable way.
There are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, you have to help them, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complicated, there are no easy answers.
Schorndorf: Intruder wanted with helicopter
The police helicopter flew off different areas for about an hour - unsuccessfully.
Two unknown men entered an apartment in a multi-family house in Lindenweg on Friday morning at 8.50 a.m.
The resident surprised the two and beat the unhappiness into flight.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, well masked, both wore blue jeans and black hooded sweaters.
They fled to the city centre.
The police used several strip crews as well as a police helicopter for the search.
The search was unsuccessful.
The unknowns may have been near the apartment or on their escape before the incident.
Baden-Württemberg: Police determine after rocker attack on snack
After an attack on an Ulm snack, the police investigate six suspects from the rocker environment for serious land peace violations.

A damage of 10000 euros was incurred at the snack and the adjacent building.
According to the investigators, there is a dispute in the Ulm Rocker environment between a Kurdish and a Turkish gang.
