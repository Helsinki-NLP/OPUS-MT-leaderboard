Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Tehran’s destabilizing measures in the Middle East.
However, the meeting will also address the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.
Washington criticizes the ongoing settlement of Israel and accuses Netanyahu of a lack of will in the peace process.
The Obama-sanctioned deal on Iran’s nuclear program has further worsened the relationship between the two.
In March, Netanyahu delivered a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republicans to the U.S. Congress, which was partly considered an affront to Obama.
The speech had not been discussed with Obama, a meeting had rejected it with reference to the election in Israel at the time.
In an emergency call, Professor admits to having shot his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police with a somewhat timid voice that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officers had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to emphasize that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said the dead woman's family contacts could be found on the phone.
Inside the house, officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note, which was chalked on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could reverse it, I loved Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me". This was stated by the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds, where, according to police, he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said university employees heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said that Lamb made the disastrous emergency call sometime after that.
By the end of the day, there was another death: Lamb took his own life when the police held him in.
One day after the university shooting, which forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors, the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated Lamb.
The details published by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and employees who knew him said, helped draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his teaching.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose teaching body includes 17 members, and many students attended courses from both.
At the same time, there were some propensities for problematic behaviors.
One student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamm had told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a leave of absence for health reasons, saying he had some health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university’s employment policy meant that the doctorate for which Lamb had worked so hard would not guarantee him an automatic path to an employment as an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he knows nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's imagination."
These are questions Lamb can no longer answer.
After escaping from campus, the police later found Lamb's trail when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38-caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' house on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.
His car was still in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, but Johnson said she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began his work at the university in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his PhD in Education in the spring.
One of Lamb’s longtime friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamm was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who spent several years trying to teach her the guitar game.
At that time he was the woman.
All the girls melted away when he was there," said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for some time.
In the distress call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no certificate of a marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the brick house, adjacent to a Bayou in Gautier.
Police said the dog was okay.
Prentiss’ ex-husband, Shawn O’Steen, said they had been divorced 15 years ago, but had remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally destroyed on the ground," O'Steen said of his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he had never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he had heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at a summer annual market three years ago.
Later, they played one gig or another.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night on the night of September 5 for the last time after Lamb finished his guitar and harmonica play in front of a sparse audience.
There was no evidence that anything was wrong.
“Just a happy couple,” he said.
We were cleaning up and joking with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of jokes.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first-semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and student committee.
At the Delta State Campus in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, some 900 people, including faculty, staff, students, and community members, attended a candlelight commemoration.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the vigil, while the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
“We’re trying to get our students back,” LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police are now saying that Lamb made the emergency call after shooting Schmidt, and that Lamb in his emergency call called Prentiss called his wife, but there is no indication that the two have ever married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas
Toys R Us says it won’t hire as many Christmas season employees as it did last year, but the toy and baby products retailer says he’ll give the currently employed employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country, while 45,000 workers were hired in the 2014 Christmas season.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said it will start job interviews this month and the number of employees will increase from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are still months away, the Christmas business is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire time workers to equip stores with employees selling, shipping, and delivering products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
Back to the Future was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I notice that the seat next to me is empty, and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will be sitting next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary film "Back in Time".
The film begins, and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated yawn and a arm’s length away from being on a date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time", a documentary about "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
“It’s really for me,” Spielberg said, “unquestionably the biggest time travel movie ever made.”
"Back in Time" will be on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon says his response to Russia’s increased military support for Syria is: “There is no military solution” to the nearly five-year conflict, and more weapons will only worsen violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN chief once again calls on all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to unite and support integrative negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France - on the margins of the ministerial meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions within the Council and within the Syrian people and regional powers "make this situation insoluble."
Ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran in the face of the crisis in Syria.
8 polls showing that Donald Trump is to be taken seriously.
Some have tried to brand him as a flop.
Others dismissed him as a joke.
Some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the top ranks of polls, it hasn’t (yet) worked.
Ten of the last eleven national polls showed Donald Trump leading in the double-digit range, and some are beginning to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nominating the real estate mogul.
Of course, it is too early in the parliamentary term.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts emphasize that at that time in 2011 Rick Perry's leadership was given to the rising Herman Cain, none of whom won even one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outsider groups like Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Trump’s perseverance and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow him.
Here are some current survey values that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump’s popularity has turned 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University survey showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positive.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Six out of ten Republicans now have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these numbers hold up in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either “enthusiastic” or “satisfied” if Trump were nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they would be “disgusted” if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be “enthusiastic” vs. 40 percent who say the same thing about Trump).
The next in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be “unsatisfied” or “disgusted” if Jeb Bush, the establishment’s favorite, were the candidate.
A majority of Republicans don’t see Trump’s temper as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52 percent of Irish voters tending to Republicans believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, according to ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same figure applies in the nation’s first pre-election state, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he doesn’t have the personality to effectively run his office, and nearly six out of 10 independents say his temper doesn’t fit into the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
If they put on their scholar hats, Republican voters think Trump is real.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week, four out of ten say Trump is the best bet.
That’s a change since four out of ten people put their money on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Complete disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this point in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would win the nomination compared to just 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, it turns out that a variety of GOP voters view Trump’s campaign as plausible.
Even if Republicans gathered for another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump’s leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffusely distributed to more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump reaps majority support.
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, 14 points ahead of Marco Rubio, 15 points ahead of Walker, 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and 33 points ahead of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A close majority of Donald Trump fans say they have formed their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of voters who support Trump say they have given their votes firmly.
Of course, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say never to change their mind.
46 percent said they left the door open to switch to other candidates.
Still, Trump’s strongest competition at the moment is the other outsider, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as frequent for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rape" in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been a turning point in public discourse for 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump’s bombastic expression will keep key Hispanics away from the Republican Party and damage the reorientation efforts.
But according to the new ABC/Post poll on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the limelight, Donald Trump will apparently do as well.
The frustration over the government is climbing to new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for around half of the support of Republican voters, mainly due to their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in ABC/Post’s new Monday poll, they’d rather have a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they're also angry at Washington.
A poll by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated about the Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent “unsatisfied” and 21 percent “hell angry.”
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg you will find the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea.
In the street, a square meter of a relay roof house costs an average of 73,300 euros.
"On Sylt, the supply of objects is naturally limited," says the study - hence the high price.
A new study shows in which special locations one square meter costs the most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square meter for a student booth in Munich are not really little.
In contrast to Germany’s top places to live, one of the prices is like Peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meters prices at dizzying heights.
There are sometimes several tens of thousands of euros nothing - per square meter, well-noted.
But it's good who can afford it...
By the way: Munich is exceptionally not at the top here.
Champions League: Bayern dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
Two-time goaltender in Piraeus: Bayern star Thomas Müller just has a run.
A lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to a deserved 3-0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then it ran.
A sovereign start to the Champions League season.
World champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze gave FC Bayern a dream start in the "Mission Milan" in the witch's kettle of Piraeus.
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their opening game in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52/90.+2) and Götzes hit (89.) earned 3-0 (0:0).
The 12th start in series will be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to bring the Henkelpot to Munich in the third run.
Müller received friendly help from Olympiakos goalkeeper Roberto during his 28th match in the Champions League to lead the Bayern, who let a shot of the world champion pass as a flank.
"We will not underestimate them," Bayern captain Philipp Lahm had promised in front of 31,688 hot-blooded fans before the game at Karaiskakis Stadium - and the Munich people kept their word.
They showed a focused and committed idea without shining.
Piraeus had won his last six home games in the royal class, including against well-known clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund (1:3) also stumbled.
But the Bavarians, undefeated in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They bravely ran, but in their offensive efforts they often went to work too recklessly.
The attacks were too often initiated by a game shift on the left side of Douglas Costa, which rarely came through against the former Braunschweig Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller was more fortunate from the right when his flank struck from the right half field in the upper left corner of the gate.
In the 67th minute, the world champion forgave the possible 2-0.
The best time in half was Robert Lewandowski.
First, when Olympiakos striker Ideye Brown hit Poland's head ball off the line (26th).
Then by direct take, the goalkeeper Roberto paired with the knee (35.).
Although the Bavarians raised their usual dominant game, Piraeus was able to place needle stitches.
But on goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was relying.
So, for example, when he steered a shot of Ideye across the latte (56.).
Prior to Neuer, Guardiola had a four-chain defense with David Alaba in the center next to Jerome Boateng, which made it good.
Mario Götze, after muscular problems back in the cadre, sat outside at first.
The World Cup hero only gave the green light after finishing training, said sports director Matthias Sammer at "Sky": "If you want to make something different out of it, that's already malicious."
Also on the first change, Guardiola decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the battered Lewandowski (59th).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76) and made it clear 13 minutes later, by eleven meters Müller put another one on it.
Before the game it had come to Krawallen in the stadium.
After a smaller group of partially disguised Bayern fans in their audience block apparently provoked the supporters of host Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and proceeded with batons against the Munich supporters.
At least one Bayern fan was transported injured from the stadium.
Those who smoke have a higher risk of losing teeth.
Smoking does not only damage the lungs, but also the teeth – a long-term Potsdam study suggests.
The good news is that if you give up, the risk drops quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is evident from the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers were at risk of losing their teeth prematurely by 2.5 to 3.6 times higher.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the gums, the DIFE emphasizes.
For this periodontitis, smoking is a risk factor, the authors stress.
The link between smoking and tooth loss is therefore due to more frequent gum inflammation in smokers.
It is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of caries.
People who quit smoking, however, could reduce their risk within a short time, the researchers write in the "Journal of Dental Research".
However, it could take more than ten years for the threat to return to the level of non-smokers, said lead author Thomas Dietrich of the University of Birmingham.
One must convince people to become non-smokers, study leader Heiner Boeing of the DIFE stated: "Smoking shortens life."
Not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, also leads to good dental health up to old age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years are affected by toothlessness, the DIFE said.
Previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long-term study underpins the findings.
Archaeologists encounter remnants of Late Antiquity at Cologne’s Rhine bank
Archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
Near the construction site for the new Rheinboulevard, archaeologists from the Roman-Germanic Museum have excavated skeletons and remains of historic buildings, said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine, historians have been looking for so-called ground monuments.
In all construction projects in the district of Cologne, the museum is always included as a specialist office for archeological soil preservation.
In the third phase of the construction of the Rheinboulevard, the archaeologists were now found.
From text documents it was already known that a fortress stood at the site in the 4th century and a church in the 8th century, Trier explained.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 graves was also discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman captured by freight train
After a young woman at the station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern has been injured, the Federal Police asks the population for help.
Early Wednesday morning around 1.40 a.m., the woman crossed the tracks from the station building coming at the end of the platform and was caught by a freight train coming from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
By recording the train, she suffered the most serious injuries, according to the Federal Police.
She was taken to a hospital by emergency services.
There is no evidence of the reason for the young woman’s night track crossing.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
Residents or passers-by of Linderner Bahn, Ziegelb<0xC3><0xA4>ckerweg, Thomashofstra<0xC3><0x9F>e and Leiffarther Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e (L364) are eligible.
Information that gives information about the cause of the accident can be given under the 24-hour and free hotline of the Federal Police on telephone 0800/6888000 or any other police service.
EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
The EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system to address the dispute over the proposed TTIP Transatlantic Free Trade Agreement.
The controversial private arbitration bodies for disputes between corporations and states are therefore to be replaced by a more transparent system, which in its functioning corresponds to significantly more traditional courts.
“We want to set up a system that citizens trust,” EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström said at the event.
Sweden intends to include the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US.
The German government announced support.
TTIP aims to create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people.
The plans to reform the current arbitration procedures provide specifically for the EU states and the US to jointly elect independent judges for a new investment court.
They are supposed to come from the EU, the US and third countries in equal parts.
For the first time, there is also a second instance.
It would allow opposition to judgments.
So far, the parties to the proceedings have agreed on arbitrators, and there has been no objection to their rulings.
In the discussion over the past few months, it became clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, Malmström commented.
In the long term, she wants to work towards an International Investment Court, according to her own information.
There, for example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be resolved.
The investor-state arbitration (ISDS) required by large corporations in particular is considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe to TTIP.
Traditional arbitrations are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, through which companies can claim damages at the expense of taxpayers, eliminate national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In initial opinions, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact described the EU Commission’s proposals as inadequate.
Above all, it was criticised that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
German Economic State Secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD), on the other hand, described the plans as great progress.
In the reform, the Commission takes into account key points that Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel had worked out with other EU trade ministers in the spring.
The old system of private arbitration is off the table.
The French government also welcomed Malmström’s plans.
The European business association BusinessEurope warned against limiting the possibilities of action for the economy by way of too many new rules.
Small and medium-sized enterprises in particular could be disadvantaged by this, it said.
When talks on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) can be concluded, it remains unclear on Wednesday.
Negotiations have been ongoing since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the United States.
Initially, a framework for the agreement should already be in place at the end of this year.
This date is no longer valid.
Delicate Folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens sat on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (today: Luxor).
Next to him is a flipchart, on which the shy-looking folk singer recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with felt pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost taken by Steven's lecture.
He tells about the different places he records on the map, what his meticulous and delicately arranged songs tell us about.
Where they originated and what it looks like there, in his home.
Since then, Stevens has proven to be a wonderfully creative lunatic.
With the 2003 released and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State", cleverly composed songs appear that blend harmoniously very close to American folk of the late sixties, but can drift into the great opulent at any time.
It is rumored that "Michigan" would be the first part of a presumptuous series: each of the 50 states should be sung in succession.
But already in 2004 and near the Rhine, "Seven Swans" has already appeared and breaks positive certain expectations.
Reduced, Stevens appears here.
Live is enough for him guitar and banjo.
A year later, the musician living in New York returns to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise"), a widely acclaimed masterpiece is released in 2005.
Overwhelming with ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album enters the U.S. Billboard charts and is not included in any annual best-in-class list of influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments, Stevens then relies on "The Age of Adz" (2010) very extensively on electronic offsets.
This sixth decent studio album is still widely orchestrated, but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall.
Long since the smaller clubs got away, the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle made of neon star bands and large fluorescent stage decoration.
Sufjan Stevens is currently touring Germany as part of a five-piece band.
In the dark Hamburger Mehr!
He mainly presents the "Carrie & Lowell" which has been available since March.
Although nearly 2,000 guests are now banned from sitting in their chairs, Stevens returns to intimacy and to the folk.
Without giving a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the wide-ranging album.
You hear from the audience: The lecture is more "opulent" and you can use it to "throw away the plate basically".
Only to an add thank Stevens modestly, playing acoustically few older songs and finally bowing down with a thunderous applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut has been eagerly expected at the Prime Minister's Question Time
The new Labour chairman Jeremy Corbyn is set to make his debut at the prime minister’s Question Time and join David Cameron for the first time.
Mr. Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six pre-selected questions shortly after noon, with his performance likely being checked by the media and Labour MPs nearby.
He called for “less theater and more facts” at this weekly event.
He also said he could skip a few sessions to leave them colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Corbyn’s leadership, as she will come after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cabinet and after his speech at the TUC Annual Meeting on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour chairman’s decision to remain silent on Tuesday while singing the national anthem at a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is the focus of several cover-page stories in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had been "in respectful silence" and he had acknowledged the "heroes of the Royal Air Force in the air battle for England".
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC's Two Newsnight program that he had advised the Labour chairman to sing the national anthem, "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve on Mr Corbyn’s top team, calling for differences in economy, defense and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader.
BBC Political Correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences also "stack up" within Labour, according to Mr Corbyn's comments on the position on the European Union and the limitation on profits.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour is making changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation as a whole.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow labour and pension minister, said the party was "very clear" that it was only against government plans to lower the limit from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour chairman to face David Cameron, since he is Tory chief, across the dispatch box in parliament in the last decade.
The Labour chairman, who has promised a different policy approach, says he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the prime minister's Question Time is too confrontational, and that he will refrain from both "beatiness" and fighting with backsliding, and instead has set out to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality, and the challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow economic minister will represent him if he does not attend – for example, when Mr. Cameron is traveling abroad.
He also discussed the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the floor, and that he addressed John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, to discuss the problem.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from politics in the style of a "Kasperle Theatre," often linked to the prime minister's Question Time, but a few years later he admitted he had failed in it.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, the Question Time with the Prime Minister was seen as the most important barometer of a leader’s judgment and leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his fellow parliamentarians, although critics have argued that it had become a caricature and needed far-reaching reforms.
'Shooted in Joburg': homeless youth trained as photographers
Johannesburg city center is a tough place to stay if you're homeless.
But a group of former street children has found a way to learn a skill and thus earn a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youth how to take photos of their surroundings and make a profit from them.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pounds rise due to accelerated wage growth in the UK
The pound rose sharply after data showing an increase in wage growth in the UK, while the FTSE 100 was boosted by the bid target SABMiller.
Between May and July, earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9% compared to the same period of the previous year.
This percentage has been the fastest since 2009 and provided estimates of the timing of an interest rate increase.
The pound rose by more than 1% compared to the dollar to $1,5505 and climbed to 0.84% compared to the euro to €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was the leading stock on the market and made a jump of 20% after taking over offer from rival AB InBev.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry stocks were 0.9% higher, according to encouraging news from the Richemont luxury goods group.
Richemont’s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China – a key market for Burberry – are again showing growth.
Shares of Glencore rose by 5% after the mining giant said he took $2.5 billion through a stock sale as part of his debt reduction strategy.
The shares of packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, down 4.3% after Goldman Sachs put his rating on "sell".
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sportswear company reported a pre-tax profit of 46.6 million for the half-year.
The head of JD Sports says higher wages are jeopardizing the expansion.
JD Sports CEO Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean “more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers.”
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labor costs at his company, he says.
The cost could hit JD Sports expansion plans, he added, and that could mean there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
L<0xC3><0xA4>pische 21 years young, a henfling with a frieze.
The guy with the platinum blonde hair is 100 million euros heavy.
Rather, even more.
Monsieur Bieber is currently in Berlin.
And the generation U17 is going through.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard of the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Including Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
Since 7 a.m., however, the polin sits on the cold stone slabs in front of Berlin’s luxury hotel at Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber-Bau: Here lives her idol, whose poster hangs up in Stettin, since Monday evening.
The suite, where the Canadian singer lives, costs just as much as her mom Ewa deserves in half a year.
If at all.
She says, "In fact, my Wiktoria would have to be in the tenth grade in high school."
"I fulfill her a dream".
School duty?
Who's itching?
Not the fans.
Neither is Bieber himself.
He took care of it anyway.
For advertising in the Superbowl's advertising break, he cashed three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pickle company flushed many, many dollars into the Bieber account.
And with every doll that looks like him and goes over the store table, Bieber also cashes.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you’re amazed at the window pane.
More than 100 million are believed to have been exploited in this way.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others point out that Bieber is in the US and UK with his new single "What do you mean?" at number 1.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is scheduled to follow in November, is not interested in the many zeros for the first time.
At least he does.
Pegida-Plakat brings Lebanese to Kartoffeldöner-Idee
Potatoes or donuts?
Both are possible - in the Kartoffeldöner, developed by Oldenburg snack owner Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the saying "Cartoffel instead of Döner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay potato and meat put together on a spit.
The idea brought him a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "Cartoons instead of Doner" which he had accidentally seen on television.
Since then, a grilled skewer has been spinning in his shop, which is stocked with meat and potatoes.
“This is multiculturalism for the stomach,” says Alhay.
The idea has now been registered by the Lebanese at the Patent Office in Munich.
According to the Authority, it has recently been protected as a utility model.
Therefore, Alhay does not want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes the skewer contains.
Only so much: "It tastes even better together," he finds.
The culinary understanding of the international community is also well received by its customers.
Metcash launches ground resistance campaign to combat Aldi incident
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA branches from an Aldi advance in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grounding campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
As Aldi prepares to open two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and social media marketing, as well as events such as Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as ice cream maker Simmo from Dunsborough, who distribute samples in IGA stores and shop owners selling discounted tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.
It is expected that Metcash will release further details of its defense strategy on September 29, when the food, alcohol, and equipment wholesaler will execute its annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at stake as South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Metcash’s IGA retail stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcash’s IGA network in the Eastern states.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland – more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern states.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that twelve months after opening its first markets, Aldi will snatch away about five percent of the food market in these two states and will take away all existing players, but mainly independent retailers, sales.
According to a report released this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in revenue per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year, generating sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and food business and in the amounts on Metcash’s high fixed-cost basis could cost Metcash around $13 million in profit before interest and taxes, Mr Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the Eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley estimates that Metcash’s revenue in the food and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce its market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash is likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr Douglass’ comments.
But it is assumed that a Metcash board member contacted Mr Douglass last week.
IGA’s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and revenues from Metcash’s food and food trade, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operational debt reductions while simultaneously pushing sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler is resisting and investing more than $150 million to match sales prices with Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week and improve IGA retailers in improving their stores through fast-growing fresh foods and delivering a better choice of private label foods.
Metcash’s chief executive, Ian Morrice, says price adjustments and shop remediation programs will increase to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by Steve Healy, President of the Australian Tennis Association
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and, according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve Healy, deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, repeatedly referred to as "Special Ks", came to the limelight by the infamous confrontation of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying game in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, with Harrison shouting, "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten the child."
While he was last seen beating a tennis racket after a cramp thwarted a potential U.S. open win by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was steadfastly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for second place in singles behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against the UK.
"One thing I'm pretty mature about is the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a little drawn into the dispute," Healy said.
He broke a bat when he lost to the U.S. Open because of a cramp, but he's not the first player to break a bat from frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the U.S. Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he has been treated a little too harshly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the dressing area, he is training hard, he is well in shape, he is a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account in the important preliminary decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as the right one for everyone, but he assures the man from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term fixed component."
“First, we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversy around [Kyrgios],” Healy said.
And I think Nick has very quickly made the ascent that people like Federer and Murray have pointed out. He rises in the eyes of the public, and he has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions. Some time out of the limelight he can only think about it, and I think it's best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes the border, holds back refugees
Hungary declared a state of emergency and cleared the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, holding all those who tried to enter the country illegally, all with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed at the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a no-man’s land and Serbian officials reacted with outrage.
The people who had fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two checkpoints of the countries and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations increased.
When a police helicopter hovered over them, the migrants chanted "Open the border!" and shouted insults against the Hungarian readiness police.
Some rejected food and water from protest.
Serbia’s foreign minister said it was “unacceptable” that migrants would be sent back from Hungary, while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrived.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
There must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulence on the Hungarian-Serbian border came one day after the 28-nation bloc failed to agree a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
However, the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in the crowded Italy and Greece, expressing their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that EU states would take in another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the continent’s immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, did not rely on an early action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The state of emergency in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities more power to cope with the crisis, allowing them to lock down roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country was also planning to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country – after it ended a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were employed in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and a point of entry into the European Union.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most arriving are economic refugees who are looking for a better life, and not war refugees who are entitled to protection – a view that is strongly opposed to other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, make crossing the border or damaging the 4-meter (13-foot) high fence that the government had built along the southern border with Serbia a crime, which also imposes higher prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency," Zoltan Kovacs, a government spokesman, told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: Illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament still has to agree to the use of the military, which is expected for next week, but Associated Press reporters have seen heavily armed soldiers carrying vehicles and dogs on the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, the state security adviser for Orban, said authorities seized 45 people while trying to cross the border, 15 others had already penetrated deeper into the country.
They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are in the process of repairing the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wagon with barbed wire to close the borders had arrived.
Chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pushed a crowd to push themselves in there.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked Serbia’s and Hungary’s main highway connection and said they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 election: Hillary Clinton's lead ahead of Bernie Sanders halved in national poll
Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins against her on the ground.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries (58 percent before), while Sanders is in second place, with 27 percent (up 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, will receive support from 15 percent of the Democratic voters in the primaries.
More than five months before the start of the primaries, most Democratic voters say it’s too early to say that their opinion is fixed on which candidates they will support.
But Clinton’s supporters are more consistent in their choice than the other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll, Clinton has lost to a number of demographic groups, while Sanders made some profits.
Clinton holds a big lead in women and moderates, but these advances have decreased.
Their support for the men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is only down with 5 points.
Clinton’s advantage to Democratic voters under 50 has eluded, and she and Sanders are now on the same level.
However, Clinton still has a big advantage among the older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders with a double-digit lead in the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in this group.
About half of the Democratic voters nationwide say they would be enthusiastically supporting Clinton if she were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support her because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support them.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton’s current supporters are especially excited about her.
The views are more mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton – only about a quarter would support her enthusiastically.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries say they support Clinton with enthusiasm, fewer Republican voters say so about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton’s supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it’s time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she’s the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton’s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton (9%).
Consent to deal with the problems and selectability are also cited.
As the vice president throws a potential for the presidential office into the balance, 57 percent of the Democratic voters of the primaries want to see him in the race — even though a third believe he shouldn’t.
When Democratic voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the top.
More than half of Clinton’s supporters say Biden would be their second choice far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead against Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election; however, that number dropped by 78 percent last month.
Biden is by far a second at this measurement, but the percentage that sees him as the "most selectable" has risen.
However, when asked what is more important for a candidate, Democratic voters ask questions about the selectivity.
Similar to last month, no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters in the primaries stands out as unacceptable.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results on some important features among voters of their party’s pre-elections.
Majorities consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest and trustworthy and endowed with strong leadership qualities.
Biden is best off with the three candidates on honesty, while Clinton’s strength is the lead.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters don’t believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don’t agree with him.
Democratic voters of the primaries generally also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in line with their views.
In all of these measurements, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email address and a server continue to be asked during her tenure as Secretary of State, most Democratic voters of the primaries are satisfied with their statement of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions overall.
But it is another story in the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public opinion on this was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said the email controversy had no impact on Clinton’s general opinions, although 36 percent said their opinion of hers had worsened.
It’s mostly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say their views of Clinton have gotten worse.
Although Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by her party’s voters, this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month, and 15 points less since May.
62 percent of voters do not consider them an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of voters across the country also view Trump as not honest and not trustworthy.
However, Clinton and Trump get good marks on leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush cut best in honesty.
A majority see Sanders rather than honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primary elections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson to step up close behind Donald Trump in a nationwide poll
Ben Carson Is Closely Behind Donald Trump’s Latest CBS News/New York Times Survey
The two candidates now account for half of the voter support in the new poll, and others are losing dramatically.
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers nationwide, with support growing by 23% in the last CBS poll conducted before Fox News debate last month, by 27% in the Tuesday poll.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The poll also found that Carson is well received by demographic groups and trumps Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been ousted with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen the deepest, from 10% support last month to now 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 people by Republican voters in this latest poll is plus or minus 6% and was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll, released last week, shows that Carson is rising in the polls — landing at 19% support among Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed Trump clearly ahead of Carson.
Looking at a Carson rising last week, Trump found some side hustles for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump’s faith.
“We need energy,” Trump said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm.
Even if peaks are measured only in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for beach vacationers to find warm water.
A bath in the North Sea or the Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some people don’t go into the sea anymore: maximum 18 degrees has water in the North and Baltic Seas this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) says.
Bathing temperatures, on the other hand, continue to offer the Mediterranean Sea: in the east, it even rises to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Baruch college novice
Almost two years after a student died during a shady ritual of a student connection in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges against five people are filed.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an introductory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
Officials said he had been charged with blindfolded eyes with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target via a frozen field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained about headaches, then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call 911 after Deng fainted and allegedly waited an hour before bringing him to a hospital, police said.
However, they had the time to change Deng’s clothes, Google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood, to seek advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide utensils and basically put the welfare of the Brotherhood above that of Michael Deng," said police chief Wagner.
He could not be revived, and he died the next morning from his injuries.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly inflicted with blunt force injuries to the head, trunk and thighs.
“Too many families were destroyed by the harassment of the Brotherhood, at least one student has died every year since 1970,” said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng’s family.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step by authorities is very important.
A Monroe County Grand Jury recommended a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng, are also charged with harassment and the formation of a criminal association.
“We don’t just want to hold the people involved accountable, but if there’s an organization that has sanctioned this – officially or unofficially – we’re going to hold them accountable,” Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the National Brotherhood has revoked its membership of the local group.
This will happen when the Fed increases interest rates
An increase in interest rates will come, and the house will shake, yields for bonds will rise, and the economy will slide into a recession.
We know that.
What we don’t know is how long it will take and how long it will last.
In particular, the history of the economy offers little guidance on the course of events.
A recession came within just 11 months of the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how the economy and financial investments react.
Therefore, representatives of the U.S. central bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when it starts to raise interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
However, in the end, market participants might find that the whole excitement may have been exaggerated due to an increase in interest rates.
“The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of ‘cheap money’,” Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, said in a statement to customers.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to normal levels, but still to low levels to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here’s a look at how some areas of the economy might react based on historical trends:
As the market has seen in the past month, the anticipation of interest rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase occurs, the impact is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency for asset yields to be slashed 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what happens after Fed interest rate hikes.
More specifically, the market has mostly been on the upward trend in the past 35 years – about 14 percent – on its way to interest rate hike, fairly flat in the 250 days following (average profit of 2.6 percent), then back to normal state after 500 days, with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a current analysis published by Bob Doll, chief investment strategist at Nuve Baren.
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the increase cycle and the return begins to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest rate increases often promote them.
In the current case, the Fed is faced with some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
It is extremely remarkable here that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in an interest rate hike by the Fed.
According to Deutsche Bank, at the 118 interest rate hikes since 1950, nominal GDP was only twice below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest rate hikes in such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question of “whether it’s different this time around,” Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been gearing up for a Fed interest rate hike all year round, and all eyes were on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week ending Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, futures trading only indicates a 25 percent probability.
“In our study, all cycles of increase from 1950 to the present have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP, and pre-recession elevations have taken place very quickly after the start of recovery,” the report said.
In contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest that the Fed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and so far this is 74 months.
Fixed income was also volatile as the market anticipates an interest rate increase, and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on stocks when they change their strategic price.
In the case of bonds, returns seem to change direction as soon as the first increase/lower occurs in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, bond yields fall immediately, Deutsche Bank said.
The strategists of Charles Schwab believe that the rise in interest rates will cause yields between longer and shorter bonds to converge closer and lead to a flattening of the curve.
High-yield bonds often bring better yields in such a climate, although “we are still careful to expect higher yields,” Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab, said in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones says that the markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
“In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy,” she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the yield curve is flatter, loan margins have expanded and volatility has increased – all features of the market as the Fed tightens its strategy.
By and large, companies that do most of their business in the U.S. will benefit from this as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debt will be worse off, as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market and also financing their debt.
"The story shows that "quality" stocks tend to respond very positively three months after an initial interest rate hike," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for customers.
Firms with a strong balance sheet have, on average, exceeded 5 percentage points after each of the 1994, 1999 and 2004 interest rate hikes.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their shares also outperformed their low-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt is going to be a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of the pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see gains from higher returns, even if experts disagree on how quickly this will take place.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says Member of Parliament Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticised the broadcaster for its "dumb"
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards and said they only imitated The Brits.
MP Damien Collins attacked the show The Voice and said it was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "transforms" to Classic FM, claiming a leading member of parliament and raising new pressure on the broadcaster to prove that he is doing something that the private broadcasters are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC bosses that the public-law radio station was "stupid" and increasingly no longer distinguishable from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "dumb" - but it seems to turn into Classic FM," he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to be under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something else – these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you’re actually just imitating what’s already on the market,” Mr Bingham said.
BBC Director-General rejected the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public education.
What I learn from Radio 3, I won’t learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there’s a commitment to live music and music that’s truly unsurpassed.
“And Radio 3’s commitment to finding new music and commissioning new works is really important to me,” he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that it would have to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the Committee on the Selection of Culture, Media and Sport to kick the commercial rivals on their feet.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice – the BBC’s musical talent show, which was purchased by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
See why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly distinctive?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced "on special BBC manners".
He added that he wished the company would "find a hit from our in-house stable" when it next starts an entertainment series.
However, he refused to exclude the ordering of further series of The Voice in the future or spend money from the fee payers for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales slowed down in August and Black Friday could be responsible for it
In the first three months of 2015, there was a 7% increase in online sales.
Last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe Black Friday slowed spending in November
Virtual shopping has boomed for over a decade, and many of Britain’s main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities.
But experts say there are now signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the 2000 records, with only a five percent increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only 7% growth in the first three months of 2015
“If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go down by 2000, that has always evolved over time,” Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales intensified three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments, such as at home on the sofa.
But now this is penetrating, and we may find that growth is decreasing.
The Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for slowing down sales.
Experts believe that buyers will withhold their purchases before this event, which will take place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers rallied around their computers to make their bargains, and some merchant websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where buyers fought for bargains, could prevent buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that out of <0xC2><0xA3>5 expenditures, slightly more than <0xC2><0xA3>1 was spent online.
For some products such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made through web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims buried dead in Mecca in crane crash - Bin Laden's family is being sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first funerals in Mecca through the streets
Saudi Arabia partially blames the collapse of the huge Saudi Bin Laden group
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed when a crane crashed at Mecca’s Grand Mosque.
mourners, largely dressed in white, filled the track to pay their respects when the first of the dead took their last trip to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The mourning procession passed at the Holy Place, where only days before a construction crane fell through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the worshippers.
The bodies were released for the funeral when the Saudi king imposed a sanction on the construction company of the Bin Laden family for the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 beavers killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children who were on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajj in the Great Mosque.
Saudi officials have already firmly pledged that the Hajj to Mecca will continue with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today King Salman said the Bin-Laden group should not have left the arm of the crane when it was not used.
An Arab version of the decree, published by the state-owned Saudi Press Agency, said the Bin Laden Group was co-responsible for the collapse.
The news agency’s English-language service did not report this detail, but said that the company’s management was prohibited from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crash of the crane, which plunged into a courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the Hajj, which takes place later this month.
The Bin-Laden Group has not issued any statements about the collapse of the cranes, and its representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also blamed the group for not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca’s Grand Mosque as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin-Laden Group.
The Bin Laden family has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is taking over larger construction projects.
The deceased leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was an apostate son who was expropriated by the family in the 1990s.
The crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage, which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remain in the hospital.
Government officials ordered that 1 million Rial (<0xC2><0xA3>174,000) be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount to permanently injured.
Other injured will receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
British increasingly employ craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased
As a result, 200 more screwfix stores targeting craftsmen will be opened
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q outlets nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that Britons lay down their hammers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who do the work in their home.
If you can skillfully deal with a hammer or a brush for painting walls, today you seem to belong to a minority.
Britons are increasingly employing craftsmen to do DIY jobs in their homes, according to the head of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, new managing director of Kingfisher, who owns the hardware chain, said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices is now outdated.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix shops aimed at craftsmen and close 60 B&Q outlets.
Mrs. Laury said she wants to employ more women in B&Q stores, as eight out of ten shop purchase decisions are made by women.
At the moment, the men are superior to the employees.
She said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households doing more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Laury said: "There is still a majority of men working in our stores.
We need to move this more towards a balance.
In general, half of our customers are women with 80 percent of the decisions about buying articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs. Laury, who is one of only five women at the top of a UK-listed FTSE100 index, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and chief financial officer.
Mrs Laury said: “This was a conscious decision – diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board.
Kingfisher reported a decline in half-year profits and sales after the group shouldered the cost of closing stores.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new stores.
Officials of Aich/Dob for infidelity in court
At the Klagenfurt Regional Court on Wednesday two officials of the Austrian volleyball vicemaster Aich/Dob had to answer for infidelity and tax evasion.
The defendants did not plead guilty.
One of them was also charged with abuse.
He was legally acquitted of this accusation in May.
The current process has been delayed.
According to Attorney General Robert Riffel, in the preliminary investigation, the defendants had crystallized that between 2006 and 2011 they used funds from club accounts that they were allowed to dispose of in their functions for private purposes.
The damage is estimated at around 400,000 euros.
Sports officials are also charged with financial offences.
This fact was dismissed by the chairman of the Schöffensenat, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It should be negotiated at a later date.
To the detriment of infidelity, the defense stated that the association had not at any time created a wealth disadvantage.
The sports officials had only offset expenses and led the sports club, for which they had been working from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money, out of debt - the liabilities amounted to around 600,000 shillings in 2001 (around 44,000 euros).
"At that time, we were faced with the situation: do we continue the club or lock it up?" said one of the defendants, in the bread business large-scale auditor of the tax office.
With his colleague and co-defendant, he then decided to take on this task.
With all risks.
"We put forward money, our life insurance policies as security at the bank," he said at the confiscation.
The association has been agreed: you can manage the money freely, only no debts can be made.
Furthermore, the success of the payment of the expenses compensation had been decided retroactively until 1991.
Therefore, some of the expenses were not paid out until years later, namely from 2003 when a plus had been in the account.
Therefore, flat-rate and not detailed bookings also appeared, the former supervisor explained the processes.
The accounts and savings books managed the two defendants together, the second defendant said.
Why the disbursements were not disclosed to the association in detail, the judge asked.
The association had not been interested in the financial disclosure in detail, only the freedom of debt was important, according to the answer.
When an official investigation into abuse of office began in 2011, an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the association account.
These were setbacks, the defendants said.
This securities account ran on the name of the second defendant and, according to his statement, was not known to the association.
"Why?" the judge asked.
The interviewer did not know an answer for a long time.
Then he finally said he believed that this was the best thing for the club.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known anything about this money, the prosecutor put it in the room.
The co-defendant was informed, the official justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as a "damage recovery".
Why damage compensation?, the judge and prosecutor wanted to know.
The first defendant stated that he did not agree with this wording because the association had never suffered any damage.
But what should I do if the lawyer says, "With that, you're all out of the tailor."
“Am I a lawyer?” he asked.
Furthermore, the official said he never raised a cent salary, he only charged mileage and diets.
He charged the association 1,000 euros per month on diets, but the actual effort was much higher, he added.
Accurate documents for the early years could not be provided by the defendants.
These were no longer kept after an operational audit in which everything had been assessed as correct, they explained.
The second defendant was also charged with kilometre money.
All repairs were carried out in cash, and he had to drive from his place of residence Völkermarkt to the bank to Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main hearing will continue on September 23 with the questioning of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard to cut another 30,000 jobs
In addition to the staff reduction that has been going on for three years, the computer giant will also reduce further jobs when the company is split up.
The job deletions at the US computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) do not come to an end.
As part of its restructuring, the U.S. technology group plans to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment.
This will save costs of $2.7 billion (€2.4 billion), the company said on Tuesday.
The move will result in a special burden of around $2.7 billion, which will come in from the fourth quarter.
The ongoing reduction of 55,000 jobs for three years has not yet been completed.
At the end of the 2013/14 financial year, HP employed around 302,000 people.
Subsequently, the Hewlett-Packard share declined by 2.3 percent.
The large-scale Palo Alto group of printers is currently splitting up: For example, the computer and printer business is to be bundled into a new company this year - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services.
Both shares will be listed on the stock exchange.
A once again disappointing PC sales and a weaker demand from corporate customers for its services increased the world’s second largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo.
In the third quarter at the end of July, PC and printer sales declined by 11.5 percent.
Sales fell by 8 percent to just under $25.4 billion.
Revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds with a split and massive job cuts to change in the industry.
The 76-year-old company led by Meg Whitman has only responded late that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and are doing more and more business online.
Whitman’s restructuring plans provide for a total reduction of around 55,000 jobs.
Conflicts: Majority supports anti-IS training mission
A direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq, however, would be mostly rejected: 54 percent opposed it, 35 percent agreed.
The fact that other states are flying airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive.
24 percent are opposed to engaging in the conflict.
A collaboration with the Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad rejected 51 percent of the respondents, 20 percent would be for it.
29% were unable to decide.
Car: Second press day at the 66th IAA
The exhibition will focus on connected, self-driving cars and electric mobility until 27 September.
After two days of press, German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Automobile Exhibition under the motto "Mobility connects" on Thursday.
The general public can visit the IAA from Saturday.
The organizers of the Auto-Verband VDA expect about 900,000 visitors as two years ago.
Röszke: Violence erupted at the Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police used tear gas and water launchers on the Serbian border near Röszke against several hundred refugees.
Euronews correspondent D<0xC3><0xA1>niel Bozsik has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point.
He reported by telephone:
A group of refugees broke through the border.
A police line had formed behind it, and behind the police there was a water launcher.
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones, sticks and plastic bottles at the officials.
Officials initially used continuous pepper spray.
The police then used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed in the direction of the refugees.
This disbanded the group.
The refugees have now withdrawn something waiting for them.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried out of the zone.
Children who had inhaled the tear gas screamed.
Other refugees slumped together and suffered from respiratory distress.
The Serbian police also suffered injuries through the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time to decide on interest rates for the U.S. Federal Reserve
The world watches when the U.S. Federal Reserve comes together on two days, Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether or not interest rates will be raised for the first time in almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half of those who thought the Fed was going to do this last week now think the Fed is going to stay a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0-0.25%.
It’s a historic event because it’s been seven years since the Fed put interest on NULL.
“For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may be leaving the zero range and starting a process of normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, senior staff member at Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy is at a relatively good level of performance, trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook on global conditions.
She has warned the markets to adjust to an increase, but the signs indicate that the odds against such a move are good.
The decision will be announced at 8 p.m. CET on Thursday
Deadguards at Delta State University left a letter of apology
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning—and before he shot and killed his colleague later in the day—Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that it “sadly do” him at the first murder and wanted “he could do it undo it,” authorities announced on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a lecturer in geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the emergency number around 10:00 on Monday morning.
He said he shot at someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the emergency department staff that police had to send police officers to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that a "sweet dog" is in the house, but that "no one will bother" but is likely to be excited.
Police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't give it.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note of Lamb, 45, which said, "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could undo it.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before finally taking his own life on Monday night when police surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he knows nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's imagination."
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities on Tuesday said there was "no information, no evidence" for a "triangle relationship".
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who stated that they were married for about seven years, as a "good person".
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who is 19 and she was "destroyed on the ground".
He said Prentiss was her daughter's "absolutely best friend."
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said Prentiss, who owned a dog called Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
“She always wanted to help other people,” Knowles said.
Police said Lamb called relatives at some point on Monday to tell them "he's not going to jail."
When police picked him up on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car aside, fled on foot, ran into the woods, and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a Ph.D. from Delta State University in spring 2015, according to his resume on the university's website.
Stars who have lost their lucky charms
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001 he fought leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
The actor also allegedly struggled with drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession.
All this certainly takes its toll.
Eurowings: Lufthansa restructures the Group
Lufthansa is planning a major group conversion.
Half a billion euros a year, the Lufthansa Group wants to save on its own with a better organization.
150 of the world’s approximately 1,000 executives will cost the company the workplace.
However, there are new negotiations with the pilot trade union.
Lufthansa is reshaping its corporate structure and upgrading the low-cost subsidiary Eurowings.
The aim of the reorientation is to contribute approximately EUR 500 million per year from cost and revenue synergies, the airline said on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer have a board for the passenger business in the future.
The Eurowings low-cost airline should be developed as independently as possible.
Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the future on the Executive Board team headed by Chief Carsten Spohr.
With the new line-up, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organization of the 120,000-strong company has been complex.
The airlines operated under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group, which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the conflict of tariffs with the Cockpit Pilot Association (VC), negotiations are scheduled to resume after the court-stopped strike this Thursday.
The union said so.
The theme of the talks is the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to achieve sustainable results “in a year with a forecasted record result” as quickly as possible.
The conflict between the trade union and the airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transitional supply of the pilots, the background is the savings concept "Wings".
It provides for Lufthansa to outsource routes to the Eurowings group-owned low-cost airline in the fight against competitors.

Luke Shaw of Manchester United cannot play for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PSV Eindhoven.
While this made the left-wing defender cry and will exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up hope that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury was caused by a reckless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated on the playing field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He will be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18, has a very hard time and then plays fantastic, and then that happens.
In the dressing room he had an oxygen mask on.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, then it takes six months, and he won't play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the imposition of a penalty.
Nicola Rizzoli, the judge, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee had been mistaken.
You can judge for yourself when I say that an elf meter and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account read, "I thank you all for your messages. Words can't describe how broken I am, my path to recovery starts now, I'm coming back stronger."
Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw in PSV defeat
The England defender has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover by next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said, "It's a very bad injury."
When a player with this type of injury leaves the place, they are all very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Gaal's Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's getting very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and then when you hear that it's a very bad injury, that's not good," Cocu said.
It was not possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched it, but I couldn’t see the attack on Luke.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said, "I know how it feels, I know how hard it can be.
I feel very bad about it. I'm so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital - after a foul by Chris Smalling.
David Cameron knows The Lorax better.
It’s one thing that all parents soon learn: If your child loves a book, it won’t take long for you to know it almost by heart.
Unless you are David Cameron.
When asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose The Lorax, the environmental fable of Dr. Seuss published in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the company’s website SuperCamps, and continues: “Funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it’s a book I like to read to my children, because there always seems to be a picture or message we’ve missed so far.”
All well and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book, instead renders a summary of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text.
"In the midst of the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted, hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," read one.
As if that were not yet suspicious enough: The text presented by Cameron reads in part like the summary of the Lorax movie presented on the Internet Movie Database website and thus begins: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted, the heart of Audrey, hopes to win the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the plot of the book. Here, an unnamed boy hears how the local environment is engulfed by the money-hungry, trees falling, thneed knitting once-ler despite the protests of the name-giving lorax, a hogging, snarky creature, "that speaks in the name of the tree."
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax 20 times in a row to a child.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was likely from Cameron’s constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's employees, but did not provide any further immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England's team, but it's still hard
Meeting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but when you see the squad that England has chosen for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 Test Series defeat is not on my map.
I wouldn't rule out an away win.
Alastair Cook’s site may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but there are good spin players in the Batting lineup, and the community spirit is strong; they won’t wear scars from 2012, just a youthful-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as a spin bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown size at the test level, is an option for the attack.
Adam Lyth resigns from the England Test squad and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to exclude Adam Lyth is, of course, difficult for me as his head coach in Yorkshire to analyze.
In his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricketers are focused on results.
There were no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, as — and I said this earlier — players are their own best picks.
A long time ago, Lyth's course had been extended, but he had control of his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he knocks out more runs for Yorkshire, there will be another chance.
England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even though he did not perform so well, and that does not surprise me; he is above all a team man.
The question of how much time a test beater gets to put his mark is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances — like Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and away.
The only accusation that can be raised was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a batsman I highly esteem.
He is an X-factor cricketer, which we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge pitch, which hit us very much.
He must get at least the same chances as those before him, but this of course depends on the team line-up in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of hitting Moeen next to Cook, which would yield an extra spin bowler and receive four quicks, appeared, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a batsman can't beat there, and this left-hander has already shown that he's a devil's son of cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he's a number 3 for her, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests on the first drop before appearing as an opener in 2001.
He made three hundred runs immediately and didn’t look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the squad as a back-up spinner, and in my limited dealings with him he impressed me very much as a young man.
People might look at his stats—on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball—and think it’s a punt, but there aren’t a large number of backup spinners that raise their hands and the coaches have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England have made some clever additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lankan batsman, as a test game advisor could be a master coup.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played in all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment to the setup.
I always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room can bring fresh wind, even if the news is in line with what has been said before.
Colly's teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used at the One-Dayers, Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part.
Some will not agree, but coaches and team leaders will not determine the schedule.
And you have to remember that as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made lightly.
Brexit stockpile (Brexit = UK exit from EU) could gain inflow if the economy falls into a slump by 2017
David Cameron’s unbiased renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get more in trouble with each day, even without the choice of brilliant Jeremy “Is it Yes or No?” Corbyn to the leader of Labour or the TUC, who is fighting fiercely for Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend recently said that some member states, as deeply entangled in various crises as the EU is now and not always on their own, are fed up with Britain’s self-created agenda with split concessions and disruptive treaty changes that they don’t usually want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it also does not like them if they endanger social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
Prime Ministers and finance ministers climb summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say they win allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wishes to see an outside Britain inside the EU tent - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - and makes it clear that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where they don't care whether we stay or leave.
Germany’s cautious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her, as has happened with the exaggerated long-standing ones such as Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France’s Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande looks at his re-election or replacement in 2017.
He is also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left.
It’s hard to imagine they’re going to tear out a leg to help the selfie Brits, whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland’s exit from the UK – something they don’t want either, because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some such ministers may even intentionally plan unhelpful remarks, entirely in the SNP style, during Britain’s 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a mess" and "The UK has gained nothing of value from the renegotiation."
The Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at their expense and which EU skeptics are the oligarchy of the press baronet, as they were during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
You can remember, weakly, Boris Johnson, the ore euro opportunist who made a name for himself as an "EU-level banana" Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
With all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
These included the medley of tax-fearing villains, phone-hacking foreigners, and the pseudo non-natives who own most of our major newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought similarly about her, but found that if you sit in a cage with a hot gorilla, you better distribute bananas to distract him rather than become his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron’s referendum vortex, because Blair had set the principle of the un passed EU constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened a back door to him.
The press never forgave him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly pat on my back on Monday in Westminster — I told him that he no longer needs time to waste on me — seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock’s boycott Murdoch’s 80s strategy, a mistake then and now.
It may take a while, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I would like to express it kindly - in development.
He says we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukip's traditional blue dye tendency and the wilder fillets of Tory's small Englishism can probably say yes to that.
It's what Hilary said "A Benn, but no Bennite" Benn on the radio and on television this week, when the scout fought in him, not admitting that Corbyn's appointment of provocative John McDonnell as a shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70’s when his old father tried on television to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But fighting to stay "under all circumstances" -- Benn's expression -- wasn't what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his fellow contenders and MPs after all the reports at her Monday night class meeting.
Whatever the moving bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the bustle of social media, a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal.
It’s right not to give Cameron a free card for Europe that allows him to take Labour’s support in the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn’s fundamental ambiguities about EU membership – consistent with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past – are no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for which the narcissism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with its ambiguities to NATO – Tom Watson is rock-solidly convinced that JC is not launching a campaign to leave – foreign diplomats will be required to try to find a sense of their superiors at home in everything.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be pointless?
The U.S. is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost reduction by the Tory government in power, which I was reminded of at the start on Monday of something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts Criticize Public Health England Report on E-Cigarettes
Claims by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people, partly with links to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "principal report" last month and described it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence".
However, some researchers have questioned the resilience of the data and pointed out the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinarily windy basis" on which PHE justified its main conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have asked if the claims “build on stone or sand”.
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said the public expects PHE’s claim that “the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking” is based on a detailed review of the evidence and modeling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single session of 12 people called to develop a model for a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to lead their opinions on the damage of various nicotine-containing products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose managing director previously received British American Tobacco funds (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed BAT’s references to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting stated that they would receive funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he was expected to receive from tobacco company Philip Morris International, according to reports.
The reasons for selecting the members of the board are not provided, but include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of which also state industry funding in the paper.
Some other participants in this session are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.
The meeting also included the tobacco management of PHE.
The group's research work "significantly states" that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the damage of most products on most criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these compounds or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE's claims that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Well-Being at PHE, said that BMJ’s claims had been previously responded to.
He said, “E-cigarettes are far less harmful than smoking.”
One in two smokers died of addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low compared to that, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what does not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die annually from a disease related to smoking, and smoking costs the National Health System <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion a year.
By clearly presenting current evidence that e-cigarettes are not risk-free, but represent only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we meet our national responsibilities.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former CEO of Channel 4
Former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice, saying commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not broadcast by other UK broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for placing public-law programs likely to be seen by a smaller audience in hard-fought time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and by broadcasters such as BBC4.
After BBC Director General Tony Hall said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he had tried unsuccessfully for six years in his time at Channel 4 to get in touch with the BBC.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC is commissioning or broadcasting programs that would also be clearly shown by unsubsidized rivals," Johnson told the House Communications Committee as part of his investigation into the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the radio fee, which I don’t think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least focus your production on programs that others don’t do or order.
They send The Voice in a prime time window because they want to achieve the widest possible support for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it’s ridiculous, it’s obviously nonsense.
Johnson said, “I don’t see why a regressive tax program is funding that could be funded even without subsidies.
The Voice is one such program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both in-house productions.
To be honest, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I'm trying to see how this should be public television.
I don’t think that would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series that ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was to blame for hunting for reviews “because of the ambitions of the people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long-term support.”
His comments on the BBC’s most popular shows reflect what former Sky director Tony Ball suggested in his 2003 MacTaggart talk in Edinburgh that the BBC should sell shows like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the more public-law niche programs "should go to BBC4, where you can't quite measure the audience, but they do their jobs, and they can argue when they go on their hypocritical missions to justify <0xC2><0xA3>4 billion broadcasting fees, "Well, of course, we've created all these obscure programs that no one has seen."
They put them in a window where no one ever wanted to see them.
Johnson told the committee, “I urge you to find a rather regressive system in terms of conditions that can get the best value out of it.
Of course you all think, we all think you get a great value here for <0xC2><0xA3>150 a year, but for people who are a lot of money for the <0xC2><0xA3>150, ask me if that’s true, because they don’t consume much from the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief David Elstein, who also said before the committee on Tuesday, called for the BBC to review its Reithian mission to "inform, educate and entertain".
He said little of BBC production would now officially be classified as education — he said it was 1% of their TV production and 0.1% on the radio — and she should take an example to the public-law television stations in Australia and Canada to change this in “inform, educate and entertain”.
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas like those of the pros, of which he said that only a handful will be shown on television, and enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make everything available online.
Sonogenetics can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction when they are irradiated with sound pulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by bursts of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction when they are irradiated with sound pulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by switching on Motoneuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
More on this subject: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure called sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that provides electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
Threadworms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did so when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, amplify the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate into the worms.
The amplified ultrasonic waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a report Nature Communications.
To create ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically altered the worms so that some of their motoneurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When applying ultrasound to the altered creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microbladders and transferred to the worms, where they turn on the modified motor neurons.
The method has some similarities with Optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neurons with pulses of light.
But Chalasani said that sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent down at an optical fiber to the desired location in the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass tissue unhindered and can thus be sent into the brain from above on the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neurons susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture devices - right on your doorstep!
The ads shame the UK's arms trade
Amnesty International anti-weapon trade show video.
Terrible killer drones!
Foot joint crushing leg cuffs!
The stray bomb!
And electric shock bars that cause tormenting pain, but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad for the world’s largest arms trade fair is a belligerent parody produced by Amnesty International to bring the British government’s willingness to ramp up arms to repressive regimes via the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London’s Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters, which can be seen at bus stops and in the subway trains and which require a second look.
"Important announcement: Are you driving the DLR from September 15th to 18th?" (Docklands Light Railway) is read in the London Underground fonts and the DLR line's trademark, which turns into the image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will be driving the DLR... customers will be asked to help stop the arms trade fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work in the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksy’s Dismaland.
A collective named Special Patrol Group helped with the distribution in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a <0xC2><0xA3>6 pack of inbus keys, which is claimed to "access about a third of the bus stop advertising space on the planet."
Transport for London doesn't find this poster "vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists become more critical and try to bring political work to the public outside of galleries.
Many artists engage with activists within protest movements and notice that they have to go outside into the real world so that their art has an impact on society.
Another of the anti-weapons trading posters greets the commuters in the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works non-profit with the graphic artist and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence surrounding the advertising for the arms trade fair – through an empty space of the ExCeL calendar – and thought, “Let’s give them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They played with the invention of a more realistic shady company ad, but "by bloating with bright colors and animation, it remains more liable."
“They did a fantastic job helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair,” said Tom Davies of Amnesty International.
What we need now is an intervention by the British government and the guarantee that torture devices will not be traded illegally on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms trade fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors are stirring up fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the U.S. Army about "the AT4CS RS shot down by the shoulder."
This includes a “uniquely shaped warhead that delivers outstanding aftereffect effects inside the target.”
Whatever it does, it will not be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in student homes
Eleven years ago, as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, I moved to a student residence, still believing in Berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I have angered - and the numerous, long-suffering complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Entry into student dormitories ranges from slightly nerve-wracking to absolutely frightening.
It's tempting to sweat: people tell you where you come from, whether and where you took the Sabbath year, where you stand in relation to Corbyn and why you "honestly said Marmite neither love nor hate, because seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Breathe through.
And help others do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It directs the conversation and helps you figure out the people you like as opposed to those you wouldn’t talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and those fire extinguishers were.
Leave people.
People’s rooms often turn into beverage receptions, movie night venues, and communal meeting places, but they’re also the places where people dress and put their underwear right.
Related: Don’t think about starting a relationship at the university
Introverts receive a rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student dormitories form a space-to-space bummel culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This could be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, “I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to go away so I can get back the energy I used to interact with you.”
Try to feel when a fellow is exhausted from socializing - and send him an SMS instead of knocking on it.
Speaking of knocking, do it.
A guy in my student dorms had the idea that an unclosed door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Friendship is made by baking.
As you start the university at the height of the back mania, knocking at the doors of people to imagine themselves with a plate full of brownies is less strange than welcoming the 1950s "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something. So, and now please smile if I ask you a few personal questions."
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obliged to chat and will eventually perhaps associate your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Poorly mixed lumps of flour, sugar, and fat cause people to stand asleep when you knock on them.
Stealing food is a common crime in student homes.
Of course, chewing chicken is a theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check this with the milk owner.
Chances are good that they say they serve themselves, even when they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you have my compassion -- but try to deal with it more balanced than my roommate, who added a rinsing agent to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in jail now.
You should not make noise that keeps people from sleeping or from working.
It’s not just about being a decent person, but that in the truest sense of the saying, you belong to the people who sit in the glass house.
A girl on my hallway asked her neighbors if it makes them feel a little bit quieter, because it was three o’clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
When they finally stopped at 5 a.m., she kindly let her neighbors sleep for two hours before she had her own music plowed, closed her door and went to her three-hour exam.
Wouldn’t it be romantic if your future spouse would happen to move into the same student residence?
On the other hand, it wouldn’t be deeply embarrassing if you held a roommate for your future spouse, ran to her, had to separate and then see her every day, and perhaps witness how she brings all the mutual friends to her.
Of course, the heart goes its own way – but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to talk to your abdomen a little rationally.
In the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his keys in his unsealed room, the boundary between an ulk and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good stroke is funny, but it only takes moments until it becomes a boomerang.
Give a valuable and fun lesson about safety by hiding - but never spoil anyone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close her door and place her keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but don't tack her belongings on the ceiling more than twice.
Row houses for refugees, single parents, low earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds townhouses for people who don’t have a lot of money in the Central Franconian Eckental.
So for example for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need housing, but also the single parent and the low earner."
“I’m showing you how to build well and cheaply today,” says the 44-year-old in an interview.
Thousands of refugees will be forced into the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes he knows how quickly cheap housing can be created: he builds terraced houses for refugees in a project.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will be pushing the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The massive accommodation in containers or gymnasiums has no sustainability.
People stay here for a large part.
Given the flow of refugees, we also need sufficient housing in the next decades.
A very banal, three-storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house needs the least space.
It facilitates integration.
This is different when you put people in blocks.
Each of the six houses that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say it's peace again, I'm going back.
Then the houses can be easily converted according to the respective needs.
How much is the cost?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184,000 euros, without land.
That's manageable.
The construction took six months.
That's appropriate.
Did the building regulations complicate their plans?
Gildner: Under construction law, I have carried out my project correctly.
It always makes the threatening Damocles sword special construction and the parking regulations particularly complicated.
Terrible.
It is still assumed that anyone who creates three apartments in a terraced house needs at least three parking spaces.
Only in the cities there is no room for it.
Refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars.
How did the residents react to their terraced house project?
Gildner: There were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely not true.
But aren’t you intensifying the competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: True, we have had a building boom in Germany in the last five years, but luxury apartments have been built that hardly anyone can afford anymore.
My project has the message, even the normal people need housing.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low earner.
I’ll show you how you can build well and cheaply today.
That's what it's about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystems technology in Regensburg and initially worked on environmental analyses.
iOS 9: How to Get the New iPhone Operating System When Apple Update Is Released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, tap "General" and then select "Software Update".
When it is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then install.
Some have encountered problems after installation because they receive an error message that says that the "software update failed".
To avoid the problem, users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself guides you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space – but Apple has made it more unlikely by slimming down the update, and it will also be easier to do so if you use a special tool, delete apps, and then reinstall them once the process is complete.
It is worth making sure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is near a charger so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple won’t allow the update to continue, as the phone may turn off halfway and this could lead to a cancellation of the update.

You should also make sure that you have checked our checklist of all things before downloading to prevent things from going wrong and protect yourself if they do. iOS 9 brings new features, including a much smarter personal assistant and huge new productivity features for the iPad, as well as changes that speed up and repair the operating system.
Rosberg's only motto: Full Attack
Nico Rosberg knows only one motto in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula One against his clearly leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton: "Full Attack".
The World Cup second emphasized before the start in the crucial seven overseas races that "I have nothing left to lose".
53 points separate the vice world champion before the night race in Singapore on this Sunday from title defender and two-time champion Hamilton.
The British already won seven of the previous twelve season races and also took on the floodlight Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old Brit won the race.
Whether the current smog in the city-state will influence the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear.
For days, a mist bell has been hanging over the city, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has a prominent member
The chess club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen", founded three months ago, has added another member to its ranks, thus increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed in Bad Kissingen for more than 40 times.
Gauselmann is the bearer of the Federal Cross of Merit 1st class and honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
Gauselmann supported the chess club in Bad Kissingen with a donation received by Chairman Alfred Klein.
This makes it possible to include chess players who cannot pay the membership fee.
Youth work and talent search should also be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that the membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "red-white" is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town.
Quartiersbüro is looking for direct contact
Saludis and the Altenzentrum Antonistift have teamed up under the coat of the Social Foundation and opened a new contact point at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consultations, you can also take part in courses there.
The Social Foundation moves it down from the mountain to the city centre.
More precisely, at the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
A new district office was recently opened there.
Here, right next to the shopping market, seniors and counsellors receive information about issues such as care insurance or services of the health insurance and care insurance funds.
For years, we have been finding out with our outpatient care service that caring relatives are often left alone.
There are infinitely many questions.
"Also, not often many benefits of the cash registers are not taken advantage of because the complexity of the insurance is barely understood," explained the new head of the business unit, Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonistift and the Bürgerspital as well as for the outpatient service "Amadeus".
In addition to the consultations, the new quarter office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
For this purpose, the Saludis were taken on board.
Therefore, additional offers such as fall prevention, memory training or physiotherapeutic treatment can be used.
The offers from the Seniorenzentrum and the Saludis complement each other in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and rehabilitation.
"The Senior Centre for Care and Care," said Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre is that both managing directors see demographic change in particular.
This makes a good decentralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg essential in the future.
In addition, Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) emphasized at the inauguration ceremonies, the district office also dedicates itself to the unification in old age: "There are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular social gathering".
The Social Foundation thus makes a big contribution that seniors can live as independently as possible and well in their familiar environment.
The quarter office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.
Eintracht Bamberg vs Würzburger Kickers on October 6
Now it is official: After the date for the match FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third-tier Würzburger Kickers had not yet been set due to renovation work at the Fuchsparkstadion, the 6th of October was now set as the date.
The meeting of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the eighth final of the Bavarian Football Totopokal against the third-tier FC Würzburger Kickers has now been finalized.
It will be played on Tuesday 6 October at 7 p.m. at the Bamberg Fuchsparkstadion.
“We are happy that we now know when the game is going on stage, now we have planning security,” says FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the card presale that has now started.
It is special for our team to play against a third-party league player.
We therefore hope for numerous spectators, and this is not without reason, because floodlight games have a special appeal.
In the round of the last 16 teams, FC Eintracht Bamberg moved into the round in 2010 by winning the district league 1st FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against the regional league 1st FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition will receive 5000 euros and qualify for the first round of the DFB Club Cup 2016/2017.
The defending champion is third-team runner-up SpVgg Unterhaching.
Vienna architect Karl Mang died at the age of 92
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of Viennese architecture, is dead.
He already died on September 5 at the age of 92, as the Künstlerhaus announced on Tuesday.
With Mang, the Künstlerhaus loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was stated in the broadcast.
Born in 1922 in Vienna, Mang studied architecture at the Vienna University of Technology with Friedrich Lehmann during and after the Second World War.
Since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect, but also worked as a teacher, writer and head of institute.
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute of Design.
In the 1980s he was commissioned with the establishment of the Treasury in the Vienna Hofburg and the conversion of the Lobkowitz Palace into the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Parking penalty: Tim Wiese hires police officer with money
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese has not noticed well in Bremen.
Footballer was once, meanwhile Tim Wiese, ex-national goalkeeper in Germany and engaged at Bremen and Hoffenheim, wrestler.
According to his own statement, he has gained 30 kilograms of muscle mass over the past two years.
Intellectually, he did not admit it.
Wiese just cut his hair in the city centre of Bremen when he saw a parking guard exhibiting a penalty note for his white Chevrolet Camaro outside.
Wiese then stormed out of business, insulted the official, and threw the fine at her feet, according to the "picture" newspaper.
In the city of Bremen, the allegations are confirmed, but the consequences for the unusual incident are not yet clear.
"The case is still under investigation," says the city of Bremen.
Only after that will it be decided whether meadow is displayed, or not.
Panamanian authorities destroy 4,500 marijuana plants
The fertile soil and the typical rainforest climate of Isla del Rey are ideally suited for the flourishing of marijuana plants.
For three days, the Panamanian authorities have been tearing out the 4,500 plants and burning them.
Men beat up 17-year-old Afghans
Witnesses are looking for police for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: on Friday evening, around 11.45 a.m., three young men were walking from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and told them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the level of the bft fuel station.
There were also three people on the site of the gas station.
One of these men shouted at the young men and slapped him in the face with his fist.
The victim suffered a nose fracture and bleeding heavily from the nose.
When his two friends rushed in and calmly talked to the racket, he initially abandoned his victim.
The injured young man was brought home by his friends.
The perpetrator pursued the group with a car up to their apartment and drove there demonstratively several times.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured man went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was again attacked by the bat and another male person.
With the aid of a baton, the victim’s face and thighs were struck.
The injured person had to be taken to a hospital for medical care.
So far, there is only a vague description of the perpetrator.
One of the men was about 1.80 meters tall.
The second racket was said to have been about 1.65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police ask witnesses and whistleblowers to call 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over Praxis Felstehausen and invests 310000 euros
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
In addition, joint mayor Bernd Bormann, business promoter Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorf’s mayor Heinfried Kabbert are also pleased about this.
In many places in the country, doctors are missing - Asendorf, on the other hand, is lucky: there Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Felstehausen on October 1.
While Ursel Felstehausen retires, her husband Karl-Heinrich will be with his successor in the next few months with a half position at his side.
After a conversion phase, Müller reopens the practice on 12 October, until then he invests 310000 euros in the premises on St.-Marcellusstra<0xC3><0x9F>e 6.
It was sympathy at first sight when the Felstehausens met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll years ago, who is currently completing their specialist training in Verden hospital and also wants to get into practice next year.
“We always had in mind that the Müllers would fit well into this practice,” says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen, laughing.
"When it was time, I just called her."
The couple Müller liked the idea of running their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
“The proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us,” says the 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to get to know and accompany the families over the years".
He also sees it as an advantage to be his own boss soon.
And so one agreed, the Müllers bought the house with practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There the two-time family father Frank Müller also grew up, and his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a senior physician in Sulingen, and in 2009 he was appointed as the leading emergency doctor in the district of Diepholz and is volunteering in the DRK-Bereitschaft Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From 19 September, the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a general practitioner, his wife Ursel (Internistin) specializes in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internists, want to settle down as GPs.
“The endoscopy comes out,” says the 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the conversion, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long-term and stress ECGs and need a talk room more.
In addition, the computer is completely renewed.
The Müllers receive a grant of a total of 50000 euros as part of a funding programme from the district (25000 euros) as well as from the Samtgemeinde (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
“This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will continue,” said Bernd Bormann, mayor of the municipality.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, about 2,000 patients come to Felstehausen practice every quarter, while the average practice in northern Germany is about 500.
In Asendorf there is another general practice.
A positive side effect of the practice acquisition by Frank Müller: According to Ursel Felstehausen, the pharmacy remains in Asendorf.
If no successor had been found, she would have gone.
By the way, those who visit Müller’s consultation hours continue to look especially in familiar faces: the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the Felstehausens take over.
With their farewell, an era ends in Asendorf, after all, the physicians have practiced there for 30 years.
"In the beginning we only had two rooms," recalls Ursel Felstehausen smiling.
She feels a little bit of pain after a long time.
"But we are still living in Hohenmoor and will probably see many patients often," says the internist.
Her husband adds with a laugh: "We have a 6000 square meter base piece."
"So far I've always pushed myself to gardening, now it could be different".
In addition, the couple has two grandchildren and likes to travel.
Croatia: "We let the refugees through"
"Now border controls are also being raised at our southern border," Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said.
Controls at the Hungarian border remain parallel to this.
It remains clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can also do so "of course".
The care and safety of people are paramount.
But it is also clear that “significant signals are needed,” the minister said.
People need to know that we do not accept borderless migration flows, even across the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It takes a controlled approach.
Croatia Considers "Corridor" - Slovenia Denied
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also continue to allow incoming refugees to travel towards Austria and Germany, and possibly also to build corridors for the refugees.
This was not the case with interior minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Laibach.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable", but Slovenia will intensify the surveillance of the border - especially with Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, is already heavily controlled as an external border of the Schengen area.
As the Minister stressed, Slovenians do not want to lock down their borders for refugees.
“Every EU member has to fulfill his obligations, otherwise the system cannot work,” said Györkös Znidar.
As the Croatian government said, the first refugees had already tried to enter eastern Croatia at the Tovarnik/Sid border crossing during the night hours of Tuesday to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to pick her up in the nearby cornfields.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have been constantly arriving in Tovarnik, Croatia, since then.
It is mainly about Syrians and Afghans, including numerous women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are also in operation.
In the coming days, his country expects about 4,000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had so far brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be diverted to Croatia, reported Croatian and Serbian media in agreement on Wednesday.
However, the Belgrade government denied that it was instructing people to take certain routes: “We can neither do nor do we want to do this.”
According to the media reports, at least in the early morning, a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid, and in the course of the day, more buses would be expected.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been traveling through Serbia all night from the Macedonian border, some 500 kilometers away.
“We heard that Hungary was closing, so the police told us to go here,” one of the refugees said.
They wanted to travel through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.
This could actually lead to the already predicted shift of the previous Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary to a slightly further west.
Croatia: "Comprehensive possibilities for border control"
Croatia’s Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influx of refugees.
He did not mention details, but he pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, has "wide scope for border control".
Strict controls are carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been a member of the EU since 2007, and since then the EU partners have consistently given the country a good witness on the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, about 300 refugees are still trapped behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they had spent the night last night at the border crossing of Horgos, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm Wednesday morning during a local appearance in Horgos: he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees premature after the Hungarian border is now closed.
It would not be a very high number of refugees at the moment.
It is not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey across Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee helpers have already started distributing maps to the refugees on which alternative routes through Croatia are marked.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe: in parts of the border area, even 20 years after the end of the Croatian war, there are still uncleared minefields.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of minekeepers had been sent to the border region.
Stock market hacker: Ukrainians pay $30 million
Supranonok is said to have belonged to a ring of cybercriminals accused of repeatedly gaining insight into unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information obtained is intended to have made insider transactions in the financial markets.
In this way, the investigators were paid more than $100 million in total.
“Today’s comparison shows that even those outside our national borders are ultimately caught,” the SEC said in a statement.
The trial of 32 other defendants in the case continued.
Most of the defendants are from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have acted from both the US and Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical hospice aid Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
There is a lot of activity around the Mannheim Paradeplatz.
People do their errands, sometimes fast steps, sometimes cozy strolling.
You will drive the two stations of the Mannheim Autosalon at Paradeplatz.
Keep the city trains.
Pulsating, bouncy life with beautiful autumn sunshine and in the middle of it four large panels each with the title "Before I Want to Die"....
The Ecumenical Hospice Aid drew attention to its 20-year existence with this action and is quite confronted with mixed reactions.
“It’s about life, so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people,” says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid is available to the passer-by for questions and discussions as well as the volunteer staff.
While some passers-by spontaneously grab the chalk and read the phrase “yes to my life”, “read it,” “go with the camper through the US”, “stop the war” or “not suffer for long”, others remain short, read, say sentences like “so far I’m not yet” and then go on.
Small discussions about the action itself, about life, how to deal with dying are constantly developing on the margins.
Peter Hübinger is also on site.
“Only when I realize that the end of the world will come for me at some point, can I live responsibly,” says the director of the Mannheim Diaconic Works, which together with the Caritas Association is the carrier of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid.
Therefore, this public action is good for the 20-year-old.
The fact that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the boards is understandable, after all, it is a very personal matter.
The subject of death and death is still taboo, according to Josefine Lammer’s experience, although the hospice movement in recent years has contributed a lot to people’s opening up.
An assessment that Angelika Godefroid shares.
The death and mourning companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour.
Faced with the subject by personal experience, she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in death aid.
When the Ecumenical Hospice Service sought volunteers by call, it immediately registered and was there when it was founded in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who accompany the affected and relatives in private homes, hospitals, nursing homes and in the Hospice of Saint Vincent.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can handle her task well and the experiences and experiences that have been made.
“I see life from another waiting, consider it precious and appreciate the moment,” she says.
The offer of the outpatient Ecumenical Hospice Service is free and denomination-independent.
The financial support of the health insurance funds and donations from relatives and associations enables the training as well as further training and supervision of the death and mourning companions.
Training for new employees is offered every two years.
The tablets described on Saturday are now on display in the House of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
Additional personal wishes can also be recorded on postcards.
FedEx result mixed, financial outlook reduced for 2016
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant lowered its profit outlook to a full year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At that time last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The stock fell over 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it would make a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in fiscal year ending next May, 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a FactSet survey.
The lower outlook comes despite the price increases, which average 4.9 percent and become effective on 4 January, and despite higher surcharges for ground transport of heavy and large parcels, which will be collected from November.
The company said it still expects earnings to increase year-on-year due to cost reduction, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company “makes solid returns when considering weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade.”
The plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than that of rival UPS, which plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
Earnings per share amounted to $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share that twelve analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research predicted.
Sales increased by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipping in recent years, which has led to sales in its unit of express shipping stagnation.
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, sales in ground transport increased by 29 percent, but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger parcels and self-insurance.
The express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result fell due to higher labor costs in the freight business.
In premarket trading, about an hour before opening, the FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
At their most anticipated meeting in the year, Federal Reserve Strategists spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagoni table to decide if it’s time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
Threatening over them at one end of the decorated, two-storey meeting room is a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the nation’s economic interests first and foremost.
The central bank has a twofold mandate from Congress: maximizing U.S. employment and keeping prices stable here.
But since the great recession, the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict, and it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be weaned off the unprecedented incentive by the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Although most of the data from the economy shows that it is growing solidly, recent turbulence in global financial markets could make the already cautious Fed representatives fearful of increasing this volatility by raising the interest rate on federal bonds — and even by only a quarter of a percentage point.
“Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the most important thing they observe,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus as to what the Fed will do, which in itself insures the financial market.
About half of economists surveyed by Bloomberg recently predicted an interest rate hike this week.
However, financial markets expect the Fed to wait, with a key indicator indicating only a 30% chance of an increase.
This indicates a decline in the stock market if the Fed increases the rate unless the strategists mitigate the blow by promising that another increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped by 228.89 points or by 1.4% to 16,599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that Fed policies will maintain the rate this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would raise the rates at that time," he said.
If she does, "they must go very far in their statement to calm the financial markets so that they don't panic."
Other experts argued that an interest rate hike would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will trade.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed well on its way to increasing the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the U.S.
Yellen had said in spring and early summer that despite Liberals’ complaints that more economic progress would be needed, she expects an increase in the rate this year.
Although job creation slowed down in August, the improvement in the labour market this year was solid.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest for more than seven years, and close to the level the Fed sees as full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And while inflation was consistently below the central bank’s 2% annual target, Fed representatives said the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy “can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the strain on the labor market,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world were collapsing at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average dropped by more than 16% in May when investors feared that slowing the Chinese economy would slow global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now being almost 10% below the May high.
For the Fed representatives, market turbulence affects the complex calculation of when to increase interest rates.
“If events in the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy hadn’t occurred in the last few weeks, they would be pulling in the reins at this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, senior research fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former U.S. Federal Reserve official.
Now he predicts that she will wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
“There’s a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the U.S. economy, and there’s almost no reliable data describing developments in China,” Oliner said.
The health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere mention by the then head Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "restrict" its monetary expansion caused confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed representatives can be expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, head of the global asset management strategy of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., remarked this month that "the Fed has a history of overreactions to financial market movements that are apparently unrelated to economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which advocates for an interest rate increase, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to lower its lead rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions “despite limited discernible impact on growth in the United States,” Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed representatives reversed these cuts.
The Fed should put aspects of financial stability first only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate fixing committee.
The recent turbulences do not come close to this level, he said.
“She certainly doesn’t want to get into the situation where she’s afraid of an interest rate hike because the markets are upset,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not think it should precede time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown.
The market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
Yes, it is located in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market/camp is a central point of contact and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department if you need engine oil.
The shop is huge, and it takes over an hour to stroll through the corridors.
If the whole grocery makes you hungry, there is a meal for you in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The cooking kitchen (good and inexpensive) in this shop is close to the cash registers and has various take-away options.
What is there here: Do you need something - something - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are inexpensive and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs, fruits and much more.
The meat counter is extensive, as is the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and fillet the fish and even fry for you if desired.
A good part of the store belongs to the massive freezing department. Here you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galgant, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pig natural intestine, fish balls, regional sausage, commercially prepared foods and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and chefs, also individual families and individuals.
The wide corridors are suitable for shopping carts and forklifts.
You will find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the checkout.
Where it is located: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking area, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the store is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking space.
Hoyerswerda: Small life support for refugees
More and more refugees are arriving in Germany these days.
To give them a warm welcome, does not go without the commitment of countless volunteer helpers.
There are also a number of people in Hoyerswerda who support unselfish asylum seekers in the city.
These include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
She also likes to teach with her 74 lentils.
Every Thursday she does it in the asylum application home on Dillinger Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, this is completely different from a proper school.
Brazil's Paediatric Society Rio Grande Promotes Nutrition for Healthy Breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS is trying to shockingly educate women about the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding, and it does this with the presentation of images of babies sucking on breasts painted with depictions of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
The Bernried municipal council approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euro sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may become shallower for solar system.
Planning for the long-awaited gymnasium construction at the Bernrieder Sportgem<0xC3><0xA4>nde is progressing step by step: In the recent municipal council meeting, the elaborated building application was unanimously approved without major discussions.
In the past, the Board had decided, among other things, to make a request for a building law "exception" or "exemption" from the valid building plan.
The "exception" was about permission for a special form with regard to the roof construction.
According to this, a "sattle roof with non-middle first and roof overhang" is to be built.
The background of the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar systems: "This will give us a wonderfully large south roof together," Mayor Josef Steigenberger said at the meeting.
The "liberation" was, in turn, about the inclination of the roof, which for energy reasons - unlike those prescribed in the construction plan - should be less than ten degrees.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
A "liberation" was therefore necessary because the building plan does not allow "exceptions" regarding the inclination of the roof - whereby the Bernried municipal council is usually more restrictive in the case of applications for exemption.
However, gym construction is not a recurring project: "We do not create a precedent with this", says Steigenberger.
The gym building at the Sportzentrum is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
Around 2.3 million euros have been calculated in costs.
Grants are expected from school and wide-ranging sports promotion.
In the next process step, the construction application for the 18 x 36 metre hall will now be submitted to the Landratsamt for examination.
Klinik Pi<0xC3><0x9F>enberg moves to Schongau
The hospital Pi<0xC3><0x9F>enberg should be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes new medical director at the Schongau Hospital.
The station and the majority of the staff move from Pi<0xC3><0x9F>enberg to Schongau.
The surprising plans of the district’s hospital GmbH, which Landr<0xC3><0xA4>tin Andrea Jochner-Wei<0xC3><0x9F> confirmed, are foreseen.
However, a decision on this will be made by the Supervisory Board, and it will be held next Wednesday, September 23.
If the plans were to be implemented, then all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Pi<0xC3><0x9F>enberg would continue to work.
The vast majority were to move to Schongau with Fischer and the still existing Inner Station.
The rooms are available.
Employees who can’t go to Schongau should be offered a job in Weilheim, says Jochner-Wei<0xC3><0x9F>.
Employees are informed of the plans.
The change has triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been Medical Director of the Schongauer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
When asked who to succeed, according to Jochner-Wei<0xC3><0x9F>, the name "Fischer" came into play, who agreed to take the lead from 1 October and switch with his team to Schongau.
For the house in Schongau, this means in any case an "upgradation" and a broadening of the offer in the area of "internal medicine", says Jochner-Wei<0xC3><0x9F>.
Fischer is a specialist in pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specializes in gastroenterological diseases at the Inner Station.
In transition for the next two years, Fischer and his team, if the Supervisory Board agrees, will lead both houses until the next year the former hospital of the Knappschaft, which still has 35 beds, will be finally closed in Pisteenberg after almost 140 years.
So far, the county had planned this for 2018 when the current renovation at the hospital Weilheim is completed.
Landr<0xC3><0xA4>ttin Jochner-Wei<0xC3><0x9F>, who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board, countered rumors that the house, which is owned by the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs, will be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future.
As with the property, Jochner-Wei<0xC3><0x9F> could not say that there were several considerations.
Currently, a short-term care of the caritas and a day psychiatry are housed there.
"What could not happen to us better, such an opportunity does not come back," Fischer said about the quasi-movement to the Lech, which had been "positively and very understandingly received by the employees".
A real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for over 30 years has not existed.
He was asked by Schongauer colleagues to take over the position of Medical Director.
The hospital Pi<0xC3><0x9F>enberg (once 100 beds) has been threatened with closure over the past decades, and departments have been closed, such as surgery and obstetrics.
The handballs of the Rhein-Neckar Lions are required tonight (20:15) at the Bergisches HC.
Although the leader of the Bundesliga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal, there is no reason to be arrogant.
In the past season, the Badeners suffered a painful defeat at the BHC and have something to do with it.
Hunting accident with two injured at Pratau
Two tractor drivers were seriously injured by gunfire during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the Abernten on a cornfield near Pratau (Wittenberg County), several hunters were in operation, police said.
After a shooting, a 63-year-old and a 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and were taken to hospitals.
How exactly the accident could have happened was initially unclear.
The criminal police are investigating.
Missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate victims of violent crime
A suspect has led the police to the body of the 16-year-old missing from Rhineland-Palatinate since Saturday.
In the interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to killing the youth and throwing her body into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate, who has been missing since Saturday, has been the victim of a violent crime.
The body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, according to prosecutors and police on Wednesday.
A 20-year-old, who was also arrested on Tuesday night, is considered a suspect, according to the report, and the investigators led to the finding of the body.
The 16-year-old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not returned home as agreed on the previous evening after a visit to an autumn party in Rockenhausen.
In the search for the young woman, the investigators first encountered personal objects of the victim.
In the case of interviews in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the missing persons, there was finally a suspicion of a crime against the 20-year-old.
The alleged perpetrator then led the police to a canal in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
According to the authorities, the arrestee admitted in a police interrogation that the 16-year-old had killed and put the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old was to be presented to the judge on Wednesday, and the investigators charged him with murder.
Further investigations are to be carried out in order to find out the circumstances of the incident.
Refugees need housing: Study warns of housing gap
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are looking for affordable accommodation.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun.
With the arrival of refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing to a market that is already overloaded in many major cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable apartments.
In order to meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built every year by 2020.
This is the result of a study commissioned by the Association of Social Housing Associations.
This year, 260,000 units will be completed in Germany.
There are 140,000 homes missing.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in a first-time accommodation.
Many then enter the housing market and get into the long queues in front of the rental apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees.
The study also accounts for significant omissions in the housing policy of recent years.
Germany is pushing ahead with a housing deficit that is growing year by year.
Currently, about 770,000 residential units were missing in the metropolitan areas, complains Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many working people therefore lived in large cities in WG-Zimmern.
Young adults remained involuntarily longer in the "Hotel Mama" because of the fluency in the housing market.
In large cities, the number of square meters per capita has fallen for the first time in recent years.
To solve the problem, the alliance "Social Housing" proposes a restart.
In doing so, new incentives are to stimulate social housing once again.
Thus, the property tax could be waived and the property tax for subsidized housing could be suspended for a limited period.
In addition, according to the Alliance, attractive tax write-off options are needed.
The funding programme for refugee accommodations of the State Bank KfW is already well received by cities and municipalities.
A good week after the start, more than half of the available around 300 million euros had already been called up on Monday evening with 184 million euros.
Now the project could even be increased.
Refugees have free guidance: Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
After Hungary, there is virtually no way through, as more and more refugees are choosing their way through Croatia.
Zagreb has announced that it will be able to pass through Slovenia to the north without any obstacles.
However, the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to agree with the neighbouring country Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
“I spoke to the Slovenian Interior Minister, and if necessary, we will organize a corridor,” said Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
Croatia is not a Schengen country.
After the secession of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have left for Croatia to reach Western Europe.
500 people crossed the border at Tovarnik, reports the Croatian television station RTL.
Hungary closed its border with refugees the day before.
New laws, which came into force on the same day, also make ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary virtually superfluous.
Croatia wants the refugees to pass through.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: “They can travel through, and we are preparing for this opportunity.”
These people are there, there are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, it was people who did not want to live in Croatia.
In the morning, the Croatian police picked up the first refugees on Serbia’s border with the EU’s neighbouring country Croatia.
According to most media reports, most came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came both by bus and taxi to the Serbian border town of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they had tried to cross the green border to Croatia on foot.
On the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees do not encounter border fences.
There are other dangers to this border strip: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav Civil War in the 1990s.
Mine clearances should now quickly create a safe passage.
However, hardly any more refugees come to Hungary after the border has been closed.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 people arrested.
Just before closing on Monday, it had been 9380.
The new Hungarian laws put the crossing and damage of the border fence as a crime.
35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged.
The convicted person faces imprisonment of up to five years and deportation from the country.
According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were received in the "transit zones" newly established at the border on Tuesday, almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition Röszke.
Among the applicants were 13 families with small children and two older people.
On Wednesday morning, there were 40 more refugees.
In practice, however, no one has the prospect of being granted asylum in Hungary.
In the Hungarian view, Serbia is a "safe third country".
The rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there.
In front of the "transit zone" in Röszke, only a few hundred refugees gathered.
In Röszke, workers began to clean up.
They collected the trash that tens of thousands of people had left on the roadside in recent weeks.
Locking grids were dismantled and one of the receiving bearings in the border location was rebuilt.
No one wanted to comment on the purpose of this conversion.
Austria reaches only a few refugees after the border between Serbia and Hungary has been closed.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
However, around 20,000 migrants remained in the country, according to government figures.
In Salzburg, about 1,400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany.
The train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the instructions of the German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived on foot.
Mayor drove "stranded" across the border
"We were busy cleaning up after the bridge festival on Sunday, when suddenly ten people were carrying suitcases at the entrance of the tent," said Wernstein Mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to go to Passau by train.
However, because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail transport with Austria on Sunday because of the influx of refugees, it was in Wernstein that it ended," says Stadler, who immediately offered his help and drove the stranded people along with two other helpers and their cars across the border to the nearby Passau.
Previously, we tasted the unexpected guests first, with snack and drinks.
We just said we'll take them by car to Passau.
"That was a matter of course for us," Stadler said in the O<0xC3><0x96>N talk.
You were very grateful.
A man could not afford to hand over a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire department.
“We were very pleased with that,” Stadler said.
The stranded train passengers had switched from an ICE to a regional train towards Passau on Sunday evening in order to try to cross the border after the short notice that rail traffic to Germany was stopped.
However, the regional train was stationed in front of the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, cross-border crossings are generally high on the course.
The Brückenfest connected with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday, a two-bridge run sporting the day before - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n is now sending thousands more to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of helping Röszke immediately in the construction of structures that guarantee humanity, our chancellor has moved the attitude of the Hungarian government into the shadow circle of National Socialism in a highly official and public manner.
Sufferers of this policy are not only those Austrians who are now facing chaotic conditions in the border areas.
Refugees will also have to realize that the “promised country” that invited and welcomed them is nothing more than another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge to create humane conditions for protection seekers in the face of the ongoing refugee flows and the approaching winter.
And it will be an even bigger one - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad looking for 35,000 winter-proof quarters
Konrad has to do with the refugee accommodation all hands full.
Christian Konrad is used to having his word weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in Traiskirchen’s initial reception centre has already taken control of Konrad.
“We no longer have homeless people in Traiskirchen,” he said of his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday was also without great turbulence, Konrad said, praising the organizational "mastery".
The interior ministry, on the other hand, spoke of a "crisis situation".
In total, Konrad expects a demand of 85,000 quarters this year.
In order to meet the number, 35,000 more accommodations will have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to be provided by the countries, 15,000 by the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
"But it's not a barrel without ground," Konrad said.
He has already held talks with the country’s leaders.
These would have assured him to create quarters for the future refugees as well.
“In Upper Austria, things are going well,” said Ferry Maier.
The former VP-Mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, with the aim of clarifying how the Church will help.
The asylum coordinator also places great expectations in the ORF action "Helping like us".
On the platform, private individuals can easily offer accommodation.
In addition, you can expect hotels that are empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier criticized the standards for accommodation as "very high".
In times of emergency, it cannot be that district donors must maintain a certain height of the towel holders or the size of the upper lights.
For a fixed period of time, "emergency standards" would have to apply.
The fact that, unlike the Ministry of the Interior, he is more successful in accommodation, explains Konrad with his experience.
I am an older gentleman who is not easily told the truth in the face.
Persuasion is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not cause the Republic any costs, as they themselves explained.
They want to increase their number to three to four.
Our own neighborhood search has not been successful so far.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
However, there are problems with the approval.
Linz calls for a better division
For the time being, no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planned by the city of Linz.
This is not necessary at the moment, since those affected can currently be accommodated without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
In the event of an emergency, however, other locations should be checked for their suitability.
The head of the city is critical of the division of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts also have to make their contribution here.
Seehofer: "Limits are not locked off"
In a lengthy telephone conversation with Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), state chief Josef Pühringer (VP) on Monday agreed on the further approach to the refugee issue.
Seehofer assured me that the German borders will not be locked off.
The further journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible.
However, there are now the corresponding border controls.
Special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer be available for the time being.
However, the protection seekers would be brought to Germany by regular trains.
From the other EU Member States, Pühringer once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue.
For Pühringer, the fact that Austria is now reintroducing controls at its borders is "a logical consequence" of the Germans' actions.
The next runtastic is a matter of time
The general renovation of the "New Shipyard" in the Linz industrial line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the publicly traded IT group S&T has moved in, the rest (2,700 square meters) is to be rented out to young, innovative companies from the technology sector.
“In IT, the smart minds are our raw material – and we have to try to make them work for us,” says S&T CEO Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in startup companies of the Neue Werft and later also acquiring some.
From the very beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - something Niederhauser promises: "The next runtastic is just a matter of time".
S&T invested EUR 1.7 million in the site, EUR 3.3 million from the Techcenter, which belongs to one-third of the city of Linz, the state of Upper Austria and the Federal Republic of Germany (FFG).
The building has been leased by Linz AG to S&T and Techcenter for 60 years.
30 percent of the 2700 square meters of remaining space in the building are already rented, for another 40 percent there are requests.
Lia Peroni owner opens second store in arcade
The new shop focuses on Furla handbags.
In fact, Jutta Breit wanted to get a dog.
This project had to be postponed briefly by the 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the pigeon market arcade: After all, she has now gained growth in the form of another business premises.
In the Furla shop opposite the store, where she sells bags, suitcases, shoes and clothes of various manufacturers, it is now all about women's handbags of the brand Furla, purses are available from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
Previously, several weeks have been remodeled.
“I’ve been thinking for a long time about opening a store,” Breit says.
The decisive factor for the decision was, among other things, that the Furla producers who are at home in Bologna were also affected by the idea of their own location, where only their handbags are sold.
“We are the only ones in the Linz area who sell this brand,” says the mother of two daughters, who even have Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has been given wide by her mother in the cradle.
I do the most good when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why so many women get enraged when they see a beautiful handbag, the expert woman can’t answer with any certainty.
Maybe it's because a nice bag enhances every outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The Palatinate ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called informers.
This property also connects some with the billionaire who wants to become the US president.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for excitement.
Whether he is xenophobic, concerned with journalists or revealing gaps in knowledge in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office is vigorously stirring up the election campaign.
And cut off well.
This is also registered in the Palatinate cold town, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire originate.
The New Yorker with the hair dryer is a term for many in the wine village on the Weinstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
Some in the 1200 resident place is more than -90 corners related to it.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.
Simone Wendel made a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find this exciting in some way, but they are not so deeply impressed in their cold-town style," says Simone Wendel.
The native Kalmst<0xC3><0xA4>dterin has made an amusing documentary about the place and its famous sprouts, including Trump and the Ketchup family Heinz.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, is also mentioned in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - so with the statement that he would certainly also be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
He did not bring it to the king of hearts.
While there is respect for the family’s performance, it also tends to feel that Trump is “a bit of a big mouth,” Wendel says.
Coincidentally, the nickname that Kallstadt has in the vicinity is "Die Brulljesmacher" - to high German: the givers, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of the givers.
Trump’s success story began in 1885, when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a gold burial site in the United States.
The foundation stone of the real estate group was the first land purchase in New York.
But the lives of the grandparents were not free from tragedy: their desire to return to their homeland permanently failed in the Bavarian state, to which the Palatinate belonged at the time.
He did not accept Trump because he once ran away without permission, the director of the Institute of Palatinate History and Folklore, Roland Paul, had declared the film launch.
Trump is the grandson of an “illegal immigrant.”
This contrasts with the sometimes significant statements of the descendant.
He had repeatedly spoken odiously about Mexican immigrants in the U.S. and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"Like the poltert, this is not as sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump ("The grandmother was a born Trump, the grandfather was born Heinz").
The winemaker in retirement sees the American rather distancing, "he's always so bubbly."
Does he think Trump is coming?
“I can’t imagine that,” said the 72-year-old.
"He's never cared about Cold City".
The pensioner Veronika Schramm mentions, like some callstadters, that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit, which was generally well received.
“I can’t imagine that from Donald,” says the 68-year-old.
She finds it better if he doesn’t win the election, because “he has such radical views, I don’t know if that’s good.”
If those who had said it at the time of his grandfather in the United States had been like him, “he would never have arrived there.”
“There are more interesting topics than him,” says winemaker daughter Sarah Bühler.
And as president?
“My president is not,” she says.
“The grapes will ripen even without President Trump.”
Wendel’s film, for which Trump has been interviewed for a long time, has seen 12,000 cinemagoers, and interest is also aroused in the United States.
The Upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau bei Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "Bergsteigerdorf".
The 1800 village in the Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday from the Vice-President of the German Alpine Association, Ludwig Wucherpfennig.
In Austria there are already 20 "Bergsteiger villages".
In the neighbouring country, the Alpenverein is responsible for awarding the award.
A "mountain village" can have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one-fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the ratings, despite Nine's attempts to take on the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to report following the loss of leadership of the Liberals, but there has been no major shift in ratings for Today.
Nine’s breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull succeeded in overthrowing Tony Abbott.
The rival Sunrise, with presenters David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was in London as part of a one-week series of international television shows, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise averaged 397,000 viewers in the five capitals, compared to Today 339,000.
Today achieved a slight increase over the ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number remained behind that of last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today reached an average of 318,000 compared to the 330,000 of Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise stands with an average of 349,000 viewers at 314,000 on Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the review!
Posted by TODAY on Monday, September 14, 2015
The great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father, who decides to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night answered this with a clear "yes".
The X-Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.136 million viewers and easily beat The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results on evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, yielded an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's hot seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of The Chase Australia scored 520,000 spectators and 720,000 in the second half hour.
Hot-seat on average 620,000.
The decline in second-evening odds from The Chase Australia will give Nine confidence that Hot-Seat will finally prevail at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a million-dollar-minute replacement that failed to overwhelm the McGuire show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man – but who will he choose?
Secret revealed?...
Lana Jeavons Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unknowingly revealed who wins The Bachelor.
The woman, with Sam Wood finally landing in The Bachelor, was shrouded in the greatest secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will surely reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski, and Lana Jeavons Fellows the day before becoming three, you may have accidentally given an indication of who the winner will be.
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
All three women have left out in a lyrical way about why Wood is the perfect man, calling his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked "If not you, who should get Woods' last rose?", their answers could become the game spoiler, who won the heart of the bachelor.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski both quickly named Mackay – except for themselves – the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from day one.
“From the moment I went into the house and noticed (Sarah’s) and Sam’s energies, I felt they were pretty compatible, and I thought so throughout the show,” Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah stands with both feet on Earth, it's so much fun to be with her," Markoski added.
I saw them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said that last week’s house visit made her realize that Wood could be “the one.”
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I'm now unreservedly set on him," she said.
And when she was asked who Wood should choose, if not her, she was enigmatic.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the remaining girls alike - it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Ten on Wednesday, 7:30 p.m.
Originally released as Sarah's first choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the U.S. - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision.
Some coaches would have banished Hayne to the bench for the rest of the game when he lost a grange as the Aussie rugby league convert did in his first punt return on Tuesday at the 20-3 win against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity for a punt return and also into the ongoing game after an injury from Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies in front of the rest of the team through the mill, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly strengthened Hayne in his post-game press conference.
49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his patchy catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne pats on a punt restored by the Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter of the game
It was certainly not the start that Hayne and his massive Australian following had hoped for for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field after the fumble and later told Australian Radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start to his NFL career,
“That was a thing that happens now, you just take care of the next game, and that’s it,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared the Schnitzer to his original debut in 2007, when a pass at his own in-goal area led to a try for Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans, holding an Australian flag after the game and posting it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia’s richest man, was arrested on a Siberian roller coaster with gun violence.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, seized by his oil company Yukos, and thwarted his democratic efforts.
Free voters demand the hiring of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high numbers of refugees.
Party and faction leader Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW Autumn Clause in Gro<0xC3><0x9F>wallstadt of a severe crisis at Bayern’s schools if there are not correspondingly new teachers for the many new students: “We need at least 1,000 additional teachers to keep the schools from collapsing,” Aiwanger said.
"Otherwise, we will get rejections in the Bavarian education system."
The parliamentary group of Free Voters will meet until Friday in the Lower Franconian municipality.
In fact, very different main topics were planned.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the Free Voter Meeting.
"Of course, the issue of asylum will overlay the clause," Aiwanger said.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as they did during the Yugoslavian war of the 1990s.
“That’s not the way it goes, we have to deal with the causes,” said the Free Voter Chief.
Rejected asylum seekers want to push free voters off as quickly as possible.
That’s why Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims: “We also need at least 50 new asylum judges,” Aiwanger said.
The FW chief criticized the fact that several federal states are not consistent: "We need uniform federal standards nationwide."
"Bayern pushes off, others don't."
“We need to become more capable of action.”
But the state policy in Greater Wall City should not fall under the table.
A long-term burner remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Minister of Culture Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) has started the pilot trial "Middle Level Plus" at 47 high schools, where an extension of the upper secondary level is tested from three to four years - as a result, it takes nine years to graduate.
But Aiwanger doesn’t go far enough.
"The issue of G9 needs to be accelerated," the FW chief said.
We demand freedom of choice for all high school students who want it.
Free ride on the G9 wherever you want.
Faster Wall Street Helps Dax on the Jumps

4 people killed after police shoot rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police shot rubber bullets in a crowd protesting against the proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence erupted on Tuesday evening in Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, senior district official, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, with some of them throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used, which are known to kill, but which are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The dispute was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal’s southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Tharus who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent clashes since the 10th century.
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been centrally ruled for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Lawmakers voted this week on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu, and officials said the new constitution could come into force on Sunday.
Construction area planned in the city
The property at the Emder Jugendzentrum Alte Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4,000-square-metre area.
A mixture of trade, commerce and housing is planned - but concrete offers are not yet available.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a 4000 square meter plot in direct proximity to the youth center Alte Post.
Preparations for this are currently underway.
It is planned to use the site for a mix of trade, commerce and housing.
They are waiting for the appropriate offers, it is said by the city.
Which investor is eligible is not yet clear.
Accordingly, no contracts have yet been concluded.
The town of Emden had bought part of the property, which is located on the Ringstra<0xC3><0x9F>e / corner of Gro<0xC3><0x9F>e Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e, already a few months ago and had the building located on it demolished.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for a holiday home settlement on the Kleine Meer near Emden take shape.
For the first time, the investor publicly presented plans for the project.
Some tenants are still worried - they fear the sale of their recreational refuge
For months, closed doors had been negotiated, grumbled, debated and drawn.
Now the plans for a new cottage settlement on the Kleine Meer near Emden are on the table.
The interested person, the medium-sized Emder company "System-Bau", presented his plans publicly for the first time on Monday evening in the urban development committee of the Emder Council.
Originally, this item had been on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under the pressure of the project critics and the FDP faction, who accused the investor and the administration of secrecy, Ralf Behrends of the system building management went on the offensive: "We don't yet have an answer to all questions," he told the council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it is good to be able to face all the rumors now.
The project, which costs between 10 and 12 million euros, has been in the debate for months.
Severe reactions among seaman owners who had come to the meeting called out the pictures and new details about the desired hotel construction.
Roberto Schulz, seaman owner and board member in the interest of the tenants, Pro Hieve, complains: "This will be a giant block that surpasses all other buildings".
In addition, he fears, like many other project critics, that traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the plant: "There must be whole bus loads so that this can be calculated," said Schulz.
However, what happens exactly on the area of the former restaurant, which is about one hectare in size, is still open.
There is no operator yet.
"First we need to have a coherent concept," Ralf Behrends said.
Because this was still missing, the construction plans are still variable.
Twin offspring at Gorillas in the Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is pleased with its gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian gave birth to twins yesterday.
Twin births are rare in gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo is almost 50 years ago and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, according to the zoo.
The sex of the newborn gorilla twins is not yet fixed, as Mother Dian keeps them close to the body so far.
First, the "picture" had been reported.
NHC predicts 60 percent chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde
The U.S. National Hurricane Center on Tuesday predicted a broad gravure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verdean islands, which has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low-pressure system, for example in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Little Antilles, also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical cyclone in the next two days, the Miami-based weather experts added.
Google Launches Double Donation Campaign to Raise $11 Million for Refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced a double-spending campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overwhelmed European nations as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach when announcing the donation call on its blog.
Instead of having a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven, wrote about her personal experiences.
“Our journey included many dark rail and bus rides, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear,” she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organizations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants: MSF, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said the first globally collected donations will be doubled to a value of $5.5 million on Google.com/refugee relief to $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many also flee from war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For mildly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study.
It’s still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data take a long time to show anything," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery, who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight-loss surgery or obesity surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity surgery to treat type 2 diabetes has proven to be effective, but most studies have been conducted in people who are morbidly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain amount of weight in terms of size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan’s Min-Sheng General Hospital used data they have collected since 2007 in one study, comparing two types of obesity surgery — gastric bypass and gastric tube formation — to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly overweight.
The average BMI among those undergoing this surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, BMI remained in those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29.
Among those undergoing surgery, 36% completely resolved diabetes and 28% partially resolved.
In the medically-treated group, diabetes completely resolved only at one percent and in part at only about two percent.
In addition, the results in blood pressure, triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol controls were “generally better in the ‘surgical’ group,” the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average haemoglobin A1c level dropped from around 9 percent to around 6 percent.
However, in the medical therapy group, it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better “glycemic control”—as reflected in the improved hemoglobin A1c level—did not reduce mortality in five years, said lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater decreases in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%), and was more likely to have a complete overcoming of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, in obese people undergoing obesity surgery, it was about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years – compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no benefit for survival in surgery patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in the procedure.
“This is the critical point of this study because it says that this surgery is lower in this lower BMI group,” she said, without increased risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
“I think we’re waiting too long until we get people to take this seriously,” she said.
I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that their bodies have firmly linked to obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really difficult."
Love story plays in Hunsrück
It’s a topic that is currently becoming more and more widely considered in fiction: A young woman, unpopular and unseemly at school, meets the swarm of her youth after years, and he falls in love with them.
Also in the recently published novel "Actually we are not so" by Luisa Binder.
Beyond the love story, the novel should be especially interesting for Hunsrücker readers, because it plays in Langweiler and the surrounding villages.
The full-time author grew up in Langweiler and is pleased that she was able to set a literary monument to her home town.
"It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe cannot accommodate all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The Tibetan-Buddhist leader called for the end of violence in the refugee home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies.
He called for the interests of humanity to be placed before the interests of individual nations or even continents under the given circumstances.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admirable, but the situation was not appropriate.
“It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany’s and Austria’s efforts to cope with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
“Looking after several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime, you need to think about long-term solutions on how a real peace and real development, mainly through education, can be created for these Muslim countries,” he stressed.
Ultimately, we need to think about how killing is reduced in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
“The use of force has never solved these problems,” he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush’s actions following the September 11 terrorist attack, stating that the violent reaction of the United States attracted a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that has caused unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in children’s use of hand sanitizer in the last 4 years
Toxic control centers in the U.S. report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve who swallow heavily alcoholic hand sanitizers, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of revenue from hand sanitizers in children under the age of 12 who report poison control centers increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children are increasingly coming to these products, and unfortunately, a percentage of them are going into the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children intentionally drink disinfectants, while some do so to impress their friends or because of a test of courage on social media.
Videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink disinfectants only because of a cheap experience.
Young people have allegedly mixed disinfectants with alcoholic mouthwash to obtain a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive scents of disinfectants.
“A child doesn’t think this is bad for it,” Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand sanitizers) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grape and orange scents that are very appealing for children.
Hand sanitizers contain anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, a few syringes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol," Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison emergency call center at the University of Kansas hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn’t let a sip of whiskey stand around, but people leave these hand sanitizers within reach of children, and when children come to it, then it’s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four syringes of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer in school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold considered legally drunk in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah lashed her words and was unable to leave when she arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma, as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and bumped her head, Ritchey said.
“That was very scary,” said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah’s mother, CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or disinfectants and store hand sanitizers outside the child’s reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand sanitizers containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a lethal solution, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-grade students in New York City planned to poison their “common” teacher by explaining antibacterial products around the classroom,” a police report said.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizer and banished them from her room.
The police considered the thwarted plan to be a "shame" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old driver has been slightly injured in an ascent accident on the cross section between Nordring and On Herdenen.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove on the cross-section towards the roundabout industrial area and realized too late that two vehicles had stopped at the roundabout.
As a result, he bumped into the rear of an Audi with his truck and pushed that vehicle onto a Ford Fiesta in front of it.
The accident-related vehicles caused property damage of about 10,000 euros, the police said.
The Audi of the 33-year-old was no longer ready to drive and had to be towed off.
Rumor kitchen: No disharmony at Celtic
Griffiths plays down the talk of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, Deila admits that the hoops are in a bad place, but that he will turn it over again.
Hearts will fight SFA for Neilson's accusation and Warburton will be careful about January re-commitments that could destroy the squad's unity
Dons increase lead over Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooney's first half penalty gave Aberdeen a narrow victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, so the Dons create a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths plays down talk about disharmony
There are rumours of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which Griffiths spontaneously rejected, insisting that he and his teammates are not under increased control as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch leader.
I don’t think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football bored Dutchman - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national player Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic, as there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: “In Holland, they no longer show highlights of Celtic games and why?”
It's because the Rangers aren't there.
People here aren’t just talking about the Rangers’ return.
Talk about the old firm.
They talk about both teams together and that’s what interests them.
There is a lot of excitement in the old firm games, and it’s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I will turn things around, Deila swears.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic must fight, but the Norwegian boss vowed to turn things around.
After the defeat of Malmö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League, the defeat of 10 men from Aberdeen followed, who are now clearly at the top of the table with five points ahead.
Deila said, “Celtic had bad times before, and we’ll be back.”
Now we want to get out there as soon as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what’s happening.
We feel that way, but we have to move on.
We really need, really the support of Celtic, because that makes the players better.
Being together now is so important.
Warburton cautiously on January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago suggesting that he targeted some January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious in signing new entries and insists that he does not want to interfere with the unity of the Ibrox squad.
Brentford’s ex-chief said, “The January transfer window is very different from the summer window.”
The players who come in the summer have this pre-season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target person Michu with withdrawal notice
Swansea striker Michu, talking to Celtic during the transfer period, has indicated that he can retire when his contract expires with the Swans.
The 29-year-old has been plagued with a troublesome ankle for two years and has not managed to leave Wales this summer.
Hearts Set to SFA Battle for Neilson's Comments
The Hearts led 2:1 when Paterson was sent off the field and then lost 3:2, but the Red Card of the Defender was later lifted - the third Red Card of Collum, which was recalled in eight months.
Neilson remains with what he has said, insisting, "I have not questioned integrity, I have not commented on performance."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The incorrigible hibee was justified after admitting to singing a song with offensive lyrics about ex-heart player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh in front of an Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was the heat of the moment," said the striker, adding, "It's safe to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle if it's not playing for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee-United management
Simon Donnelly insists that Dundee United’s board of directors still has confidence in the management team to turn things around – but admits that the decline must end on the field.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We're going to get the guys back on track," Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy to win against Hamilton "unbeautiful".
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team desperately had to fight Hamilton Accies to see a seventh consecutive league win, which brought them a five-point lead ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's first-half Elfmeter.
McInnes said, “There is no team that has won everything, in cup games or leagues that have not won games of this kind.”
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as it increases in the UK as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
Scotland’s unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was above that of the UK of 5.5 percent, as the Office of National Statistics (ONS) figures showed.
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 over the three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 percent during the quarter – a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
The Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said, "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It has been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the UK.
In these 12 months we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decrease in unemployment.
The drunks disrupted the process.
Since the security personnel could not satisfy the situation, the staff called the police.
Only with the use of pepper spray could the officials take the troublers into custody.
A breath alcohol test showed 0.89 per mille in a 16-year-old.
The adult was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 per million and initially remained in custody.
Why I Will Be a Witness to an Execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except in the case of a late legal intervention, I will watch a man be put to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn’t happen, I’ll sit in a spectator gallery in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary Death Chamber when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison syringe.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day drew closer, I began to fear.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the United States, and as more applications are often available as places, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.
Those who are chosen will observe it without emotion.
I can't do that.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen with me to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of giving up my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it, and you get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she “could have formulated it better,” but she still thinks it’s wrong what I’m doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn’t tell me what to write, and I wouldn’t do it even if he did.
I told him that he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks that the public relations work of the movement will help against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I made.
I don’t want to go back to all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the act.
But I think there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder.
I am sure there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective I will see him die.
I can’t claim to be objective.
There will be other reporters you can contact.
What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man persuades after wet police chase to get out of Canning River
The Canning Vale police officer stayed dry when he persuaded the man of the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to hang the police was unsuccessful when he was in the shallow and swampy water, just a few meters from a police officer who tried to "slowly persuade him to return to the shore."
The Canning Vale police were called on Tuesday for a housebreaking incident in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them towards the Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said 'I'm not coming out, come and get me,'" said Senior Sergeant Shandel Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec wasn't too excited to make his uniform wet, so he applied a more reliable tactic - "A good cop negotiates".
“Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape,” said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the ditch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that Stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to end racing
Peter Moody claims that Racing Victoria stewards tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He aimed at Racing Victoria’s stewards and integrity department, claiming that they were conducting a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai’s Late Scratching for a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he had always tried to do what was best for racing and found himself in difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt dip test at Lidaris, which he cannot explain.
He had been holding back 18 months for the espionage allegations and didn't want it to "look like too high-hanging grapes."
“I had planned to say nothing about it, and I sat on it for a long time, but sometimes you’re so frustrated that everything comes out at once,” Moody said.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I will go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk around the raised head, and I want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them.
If they start thinking, I don’t, then I shouldn’t be a coach anymore.
I have to think about what I do with my license.
Previously, Moody had raised the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man I'm going to name when I'm asked to, and offered him an employment in my stables to provide information about what I'm doing inside my stables," Moody said on Racing.com.
They seem to think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should certainly touch their noses because they have failed in trying to touch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, acting president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and are still today.
Does that make me think it will be personal?
Does the RVL behave cowardly and perhaps blame people outside of coaches for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think it's me.
Maybe they need to take my license and violate me, and I have no doubt that what I say makes them think about it now.
But I have now arrived at the point where I don’t care, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I will put pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The coach's frustration levels have built up with the long-running cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the late scratching led him to say that he "can throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known for his preparation of the unbeaten champion Black Caviar, called the race day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse's legs, which violated the rules.
"It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for that,” he said.
"One of my employees mistakenly applied mud to the leg.
It could have been like that last night.
It could have been like that all day yesterday.
It was like that on race day too.
Moody could be faced with a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on race day, an investigation into this matter opened.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about the horse.
“We all see that we need rules, but here you’ve gone too far,” Moody said.
Man arrested after driver's flight
Police arrested a man on weekends after a collision with a cyclist and subsequent driver's flight in Cobram.
The cyclist was taken to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver drove on without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia appeared to the police in Shepparton.
It is expected to be charged for driver's flight and failure to provide assistance and for other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram remains in the hospital and is in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy Strikes Back Rivals for Claims of Ring Fighting
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has called criticism of the tackling of his players a "agenda setting" of two Premier League favourites of the NRL.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed Storm players "ring fights" with his team during the high storm victory at the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Bronco coach Wayne Bennett made a barely veiled note to the Storm team after his team scored the final win against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, calling the game a "pattern example" of the Rugby League, saying the two from Queensland are not "too good" in the ring.
Bellamy defended his team's tack limg and said they were only focused on their "contact" when tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading coaches on his team gives him confidence, as it means that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
"It keeps popping up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about ring fights when they beat us 24:2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven’t changed anything about our defensive system or the techniques throughout the year, but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tackles a real focus, and that has brought the trend change for us.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train, so he’s probably not used to losing, so it was a bit of a shock to him.
It’s funny how this happens again and again at this time of year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "slow" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night and how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he would take care of it.
But now he has a team that can play and that we consider exciting, especially his young players at their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants all of his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like this.
I build more confidence because they say these things because they’re a bit concerned about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn’t think of us when it came to the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm vs. Roosters scored a higher result than the game Broncos vs. Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I haven’t watched it yet, but what was the result? 16:12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are you taking breaks and not doing anything exciting?
For me, these are the game plans.
If they mention us, it means that we will still meet them in one phase.
The Storm team is free this weekend, as they won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks the next Saturday evening in the pre-finals at AAMI Park. Ticket sales start from next Tuesday morning.
Serbian with $200,000 bail after drug charge
A man who may face a life sentence for trying to get possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland was released for a $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the Solay yacht, which came from South America via Vanuatu and landed in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed meeting his fellow defendants at the marina during the morning and later at Café Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a potentially life sentence for trying to own a commercial amount of cocaine, Maksimovic’s lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he was trying to own the entire amount and that the cafe could have been for a harmless reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the risk of Maksimovic’s escape.
He has a clear relationship with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the case of the criminal case, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovic’s mother and stepfather had offered a $200,000 security deposit together to secure his release.
"After reading the affidavits of the two people, it is clear that the imposition of a security of $200,000 is a real financial burden," Flanagan said.
But that alone will not be enough to prevent him from not appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail, under the conditions that he will hand over his Australian and Serbian passports, report to the police daily and hold an exit lock from 18:00-06:00.
Accident on A5 near Karlsruhe: Führerhaus tearing apart
A truck driver was seriously injured in a three-truck collision on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe on Tuesday evening.
Two of the three trucks involved had braked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to avoid turning left at the last moment, as the police said.
The cab of the accident-causing driver completely ripped apart.
The driver was taken seriously injured to a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely closed for six hours to 2 p.m.
A damage of 122,000 euros was incurred.
Stevan Hogg used girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone as she slept, logging into an online messaging service from which he received a series of indecent pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She saw it through, found the confusing messages, and immediately alerted her mother.
The police took care of it and saw the five images, then analyzed computers found at the address and discovered "relevant" web searches that used terms to search for indecent images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he had done so, as it would lead to “pedophiles on the Internet” and then he “forgotten to be a policeman to scare them.”
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff's Court, "he said it was an addiction, that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that the searches were done on the computer by him, but said it happened because he wanted to claim to be a police officer to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said he was sick in the head when he drinks, and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was trembling and crying.
She then also saw the indecent pictures on the phone and confronted the defendant with it.
The girl was interviewed and said the defendant used computer and playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty in the sense of the indictment to having taken indecent pictures of children on June 14 last year, violated the conditions on January 25 this year and not appeared in court for a hearing on March 24 this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to appear in the sexual offender register, as one could argue that "no significant sexual element" could be found in his offense.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in custody for hearings on other outstanding cases.
It was added to the list of sexual offenders before the date of the judgment.
Lockers move to small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being picked up off the major checkpoints on the German-Austrian border.
Many locksmiths left people increasingly at smaller border crossings for fear of discovery and arrest
On the Austrian side, a spokesman for the Federal Police said.
Since Tuesday, more than 1,000 refugees have been taken up along the Inn border river in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn.
They had come to the German side on foot over bridges and dams.
There they are received by federal police officers and forwarded to registration.
At Munich Central Station, according to Federal Police reports, significantly more refugees arrived again on Wednesday compared to the beginning of the week.
By 8 a.m. alone, around 700 people had arrived in the state capital, a spokesman said in the morning.
After the reintroduction of controls on the German-Austrian border, refugees had reached the city on Tuesday 1759.
Stuttgart: Outcrops of Tropical Storm "Henry" expected in the southwest
Meteorologists warn of storm surges in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low pressure area across Western Europe, warm sea air is currently flowing into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart said.
The strong low is the foothills of the tropical storm "Henry", which has been pulled over the Atlantic in recent days by the Bermuda Islands.
Severe storms and thunderstorms are expected especially in Baden.
According to DWD, gusts of 60 to 90 kilometres per hour can be expected until Thursday morning in the Black Forest, on the Swabian Alb and in the Bodenseekreis.
On Friday we can see the sun for longer.
The crowd does it: every two years the carmakers at the IAA show their novelties.
In 2015, there is movement in the compact cars, which are currently selling particularly well.
Cars from the compact class are currently particularly in demand: According to the Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA), around 28.1% of new registrations accounted for this segment in August alone.
This is also reflected in the IAA (Public Days 17 to 27 September).
Between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new premium and luxury cars, many new compact models will be presented this year.
One of the biggest premieres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be with the dealers in the fall.
“The Astra is an extremely important model for us,” said Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann at the trade fair.
It is at the heart of the brand.
In order for the volume model to sell well, the new Astra should not be much more expensive.
Opel is looking forward to an entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf, which starts at 17,650 euros.
The current Astra costs from 16 990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4-litre engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
In addition, the Hessens offer further diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW//200 hp, including three-cylinder petrol engines for the first time.
Unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is initially only available as a five-door car.
As a second variant, the combination will follow in the spring, which can also be seen at the IAA.
And what is going to happen next to the Astra at the IAA on new compact cars?
Renault Mégane: Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mégane into the race.
At the fair, the Mégane can only be seen as a five-doorer in a conventional and an emphasised sporty GT version.
He will be in the trade at the beginning of next year, then also as a combi.
Infiniti: New in the segment is the Infiniti Q30.
With the new model, the Nissan subsidiary wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment.
The compact Infiniti with its curved lines fits fully into the design line of the brand.
The basic model will receive a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
On offer is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW/111 hp.
According to the manufacturer, the maximum torque is 170 Newton meters (Nm).
Baleno’s sales start in Europe is in the spring of 2016.
DS 4: Not entirely new, but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen at the IAA.
On the outside, the designers of the noble Citro<0xC3><0xAB>n ableger put their hands on the front: the radiator grille was redrawn and the modified headlights were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system was mainly modernized, the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and integrated for the first time Apple’s CarPlay.
In addition, a number of revisions and new variants such as the refreshed Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI are joined at the IAA in the compact class.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are humane
The Federal Constitutional Court has given justice to an ex-prisoner of the Tegel judicial prison, who had been housed in a too small cell for months.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, those affected can hope for money even if they were confined in the too narrow rooms for a few days (Az.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
Thus, an ex-captain with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful: he was housed in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space in the Berlin-Tegel judicial prison between June and November 2009; the toilet was not separated spatially.
After that, the man, who, according to his lawyer, is now free again, had been moved to a larger cell.
His arrest lawsuit for the unfair terms of detention against the country of Berlin failed.
However, the Constitutional Court upheld the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and dismissed the case for re-examination there.
You see the man's dignity hurt.
Chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, only a few days of detention for the compensation were decisive for the period in question, there was a claim for compensation, it said.
Otherwise, “a growing fear of the legal protection of the personality.”
The Court of Appeal must now clarify the amount of the compensation.
In the past, the constitutional courts have often strengthened the rights of prisoners.
In April, they only awarded compensation to a prisoner because he was locked naked in a cell.
According to a 2011 decision, the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet is also unworthy of humans.
Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court, which in a parallel case in November 2009 had certified an inhumane accommodation to a prisoner.
The plaintiff at the time was housed daily for three months between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the case of Karlsruhe.
The Berlin prisons have also come into the headlines in recent weeks due to lack of staff.
Prisoners are therefore repeatedly locked in for 23 hours, the aggressiveness increases, even to clubs it is said to have come because of the tense situation.
According to the judicial press office, 21 jobs in Tegel are not occupied due to young talent shortages, 19 are to be eliminated in 2016.
Angela Merkel and refugee policy: "We can do this"
Immigration of refugees is a huge challenge – the Chancellor is determined to accept them.
What happens to Germany?
Around 800,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year according to forecasts from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to accept one million refugees.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: we can do this, and we can do this".
What comes to Germany, gives the following overview.
According to different forecasts, between 350,000 (estimation of the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimation of the Pestel Institute) apartments are used annually - for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as it has been built to date (250000 apartments).
The lack of housing is dramatic, but especially with affordable rental properties: 60000 to 80000 social housing units fall out of the rental price commitment every year, and refugees will also apply for these particularly cheap apartments.
Federal Minister of Construction Barbara Hendricks (SPD) wants to double the funding, from currently 518 million to one billion euros.
In the view of the Pestel Institute, this is far too little: 80,000 social housing units would have to be built annually and the federal government would have to invest 6.4 billion a year in funding.
Scientists and Federal Minister of Construction agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in housing construction.
According to estimates from the Institute for Labour Market and Vocational Research, it is assumed that 55 percent of refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term.
However, the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started, says Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
However, it is crucial for the integration of refugees whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, to the appreciation of the host society, but also to the self-esteem of the immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thr<0xC3><0xA4>nhardt.
In Germany, according to Thr<0xC3><0xA4>nhardt, there has been a political shift: from the ban on working for refugees to the recognition of work.
While there used to be a work ban for asylum seekers of up to five years, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the residency requirement, which restricted asylum seekers to a place of residence.
In society, even because of the shortage of skilled workers, the majority of the view has been that refugees should be allowed access to the labour market more quickly.
A major barrier to access to the labour market is a lack of German skills.
So far, there is not a sufficient range of general and professional language courses.
Research also shows that jobs are most often mediated through personal contacts.
In Thr<0xC3><0xA4>nhardt’s view, networking is therefore the Königsweg’s way of working integration.
The Berlin School Administration has found that only a few refugee parents put their children in the kitas, an estimated ten to 15 percent: "For the uprooted parents, it is first of all very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration.
In order to convince the family of the benefits of the kita, the administration distributes handcuffs in different languages.
Should the need for educators increase significantly due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities – for example, by allowing more specialist schools.
In the countries, students without German skills in welcome classes are prepared for classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin School Administration.
The German Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or patients from studying - the only exception was so far Berlin, but interior senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now given up his attitude.
Student-willing refugees could be facilitated access to the university.
Refugees with a residence permit or a permit no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Applicant Services Act when they start their studies.
In principle, the latter do not receive a bafög, since they do not fall under the circle of the bafögbeglichten persons.
Patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years in order to be eligible for Bafög, from 1 January 2016 this span shortens to 15 months.
However, this funding gap must also be closed, as Steffen Krach, Berlin’s State Secretary for Science, and the German Studentenwerk demand.
The students should get Bafog immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should successively grant Islam the same rights as the churches, and develop the existing state-church law into a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic Welfare Association that takes care of the new arrivals professionally.
The rights also include duties.
Thus, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and give it certain control options.
This includes the willingness to take a firm stand against religious fundamentalism.
The president of the Muslim Central Council, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany.
Those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany "have immediately forfeited their right to reside here, in Germany," he said in Bayrischer Rundfunk.
He proposed to translate the Basic Law into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be much more an issue for the whole society than it is today.
With this, the majority society will also have to change, the reduction of discrimination and racism will become more pressing.
Germany, as a result of European decisions, has been an anti-discrimination body and a general equality law for almost a decade.
But it learns very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in which police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and the interest groups of non-white Germans have long demanded and what international agreements such as the Anti-Racism Convention Germany commit to, must become a reality in the coming years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens should use their opportunities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care for the refugees that have been expected so far, says Medical President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
“As far as manpower and capacity are concerned, we can do that,” he told the Daily Mirror.
However, additional money has to flow into the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery asks to hand out health cards to all arrivals immediately upon registration.
Services rendered could later be settled with the federal states.
And in the long run, it is highly questionable to feed so many people with the limited catalogue of services provided by the Asylum Applicant Services Act.
Otherwise, doctors mainly create language barriers.
To date, Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has proven that migrants are being better informed about their illnesses than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in medical practices, interpreter costs would have to be taken over, she demands.
Many refugees would be helped, but also with more general medical contact points in the emergency ambulances.
And with another diagnostic look.
Among refugee children, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and among the young people it is about HIV education.
However, German doctors came from their education with the partially different diseases, says Montgomery.
"Parasite infestation or tuberculosis is not so difficult to detect". And as far as the lack of doctors is concerned, the refugees may even be able to see relief in sight.
The Syrians had a highly developed education system, some refugees were even doctors.
However, in order to practice, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take exams again.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill, according to estimates by the Federal Psychotherapist Chamber (BPtK): most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, explains Dietrich Munz, President of BPtK.
A recently published study by the Technical University of Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee children arrive traumatized in Germany.
Those who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder suffer from, among other things, so-called flashbacks with respiratory distress, dizziness, heart disease and death anxiety.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, severe horrendousness and emotional numbness.
To prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment is necessary, Munz explained.
So far, however, only 4% of mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers in the social offices can apply for psychotherapy, processing usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social offices, most experts or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would decide whether therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to misassessments, Munz says.
Manege invites you to dream
With the new production "Leidenschaft" the Circus Probst draws on the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to captivate every age group with fascinating acrobatics, animal dressage and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites you to bathe in the manege on the brick to dream.
"Our passion is the circus."
“I can’t imagine living without my circus family,” says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior chief.
"Leadership" - under this motto is the current Manegen staging.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the Probst family.
The gift of enthusiasm is in the blood of the family.
“It’s important for us to get people out of their daily routine and take them to a completely different world for two hours,” said the 27-year-old junior chief.
"Manegencocktail with Weltstadt-Flair", director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities on the nearly 3,000-kilometre tour can now experience this flair.
The program of the circus convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Awarded at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family captivates the audience with wit and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft.
With the heroes of the silent films, it wants to capture the Cuban duo loosely.
Lightness and mobility - with these words they identify themselves.
Her humorous art on the mast is meant to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
In addition to numerous salmon ointments, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinates with fingertips and jointivity.
Balance with the unicycle on a ball?
No problem for He Yuan.
Snake people fascinate and frighten at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like few others and fascinates with its mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every way.
“The animals belong to our family,” emphasizes Stephanie’s mother, Brigitte Probst.
Disadvantages in the posture of circuses are all too often the subject of various animal welfare organizations.
Stephanie Probst also said, “If our animals are not doing well, we are not doing well.”
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each petting unit.
The "four-legged artists", as they are affectionately called, are read from their eyes whenever possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal does not feel well, it does not want to go to the mange.
The first rule is to take good care of the animals.
Especially on her zebroid jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland Pony stallion and a zebra stud, the Probst family is proud.
The two animals have lived together for eight years in a enclosure and nothing has happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little jumbo was there," says Brigitte Probst.
Although the Zebroid is not yet ready for the Manege, it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
There should be something for every visitor.
“One thing is certain,” says Stephanie Probst, “whether five or 1,200 spectators, we always do our best and are there with all our heart.”
The Circus Probst invites you to its performances every day from September 17th to 20th at 5pm and 8pm.
On Sunday, the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.
Thursday is family day, for the performance at 5 pm the prices are reduced.
The animal show is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe to give a wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year.
He remained uninjured, but the video of the case quickly spread through the social media.
The opening of parliament was also clouded by allegations by opposition MPs that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned to accompany Mr Mugabe’s address with bulwarks.
Last month, they had ousted him and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) spokesman Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their phones warning them against disturbing Mr. Mugabe's address.
"The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it's titled 'Death'," he told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
It warns affected Members of Parliament that immunity ends in Parliament, and once they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesman said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was “concerned” about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of the company’s restructuring and savings efforts in its services.
HP will split into two publicly traded companies later this year, separating the computer and printer business from its fast-growing enterprise hardware and service business.
The expected job cuts result in a burden of over $2.7 billion as of the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
“These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, who will lead the unit after the separation.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today, and we have a broad and in-depth portfolio of businesses that support companies in transitioning to a new style of business,” Whitman said.
As an independent company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion in annual revenue and “will be focused on providing previously unreached, integrated technology solutions for businesses,” the company said in a statement.
It splits a company that was founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical systems and whose Palo Alto garage called man "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has undergone massive restructuring to cope with the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
HP’s measure, the world’s second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies, is the latest in this field, based on the belief that closely focused companies deliver better performance.
FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates need to stand behind injured Jack Wilshere before playing against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger stressed to Wilshere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and given his history, his participation in the European Championship next summer is certainly still uncertain.
The big shame about this current problem is that Wilshere had severely ended the last season after a separate ankle injury and then recovered to his old swing during the preseason.
“This type of injury does not threaten the career,” Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
This is not a big deal.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his ankles or the injuries he had previously suffered.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the associated risk of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The investigation by Premier Injuries Ltd records 23 different diseases of Wilshere since its debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games in the last five seasons.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007/08 they have been one of the two Premier League clubs that have recorded the most days of injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
“Sometimes, when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period of time, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain fighting power,” Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to overcome this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career the way he deserves.
Arsenal will start their Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Wenger will set a rotation within the team.
Héctor Beller<0xC3><0xAD>n and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are expected to launch.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
“I’m trying to keep the balance and give the players who need it a little break,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites to advance through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the biggest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is also unbeaten after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign was launched last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has drawn lessons from last season’s Champions League cap against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the club to its first European Cup triumph with its management.
“This drive is immense,” Wenger said.
It has never worked at Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand, I’m in business long enough to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendships
The lack of similar portrayals in shows is obvious, especially with regard to how the need for men to open up has now become even more desperate than ever, as suicide rates among young men at a 15-year high prove.
In 2013, it was the leading cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the year of the man, with the goal of challenging the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge.
A recent study in more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with “healthy mood,” his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But of course, you have to have friends first so that a friendship can work.
In the age of social media-led communication, with its emphasis on style over substance, the immediacy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, lifelike and successful, even if in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of intrinsic values – our inner longing for personal development and friendship, which has a much deeper impact on our mental health.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really can’t buy happiness.
The nice thing about Friends was that this focus was turned on the head.
Each character was defined not by his work, but by his personality, which shone through interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler’s frequent hugs, moments of football watching in cozy armchairs, and Ross’s longing for Rachel—all this came from the knowledge that men can relate to it in any case, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
“My listening role for people who feel depressed and at risk of suicide has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference.”
The men who contact us often don’t feel able to talk to friends.
The old saying “I’ll deal with it” has an enormous effect, like the feeling that it’s perceived as weakness when you talk openly about problems.”
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term coping mechanisms.
She clearly presents the little moments of male friendships.
As much as my objective outsider status over the phone may help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you visit Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with the scenery completely redesigned to celebrate the day, why not take your friends for a drink in the Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting around alone in Starbucks, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends are sent to Comedy Central from start to finish - the entire 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit against Malmö.
Di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG pass Malmö.
Here is the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani took course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 win against Malmö at the Prinzenparkstadion on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player who put the French champion on the way, but after that they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their lead when Cavani scored a headball goal in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion, as they not only aspire to qualify for the K.O. rounds, but an improvement on their way to the quarter-finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a class game of Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic's missed chances in front of the goal, and he was later replaced in the game against his hometown team and against the club with which he started his illustrious career as early as 1999.
“It’s not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so it’s a good start to win 2-0, causing our opponents problems and looking back relaxed, even if there are certain things we still need to perfect over the course of the season,” Blanc said.
“This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we haven’t scored one or two more goals.”
Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team after his injury in one of three changes, which was able to hold a 2-2 draw on his own against Bordeaux in the First League on the weekend, but he was eliminated in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentine winger was described as the man who can take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he indicated why when he walked into Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Malmö defense before passing Johan Wiland nicely into the long corner of the network.
However, if someone believed that PSG would achieve a big win, he was disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this stage, joined Anpiff with nine national players in the field and was a heavy opponent with a five-man defense and two deep in the midfield.
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who walked far past Kevin Trapp’s posts in the 34th minute, they offered little in the attack.
Instead, PSG sometimes gave up on himself, with some mishaps and bad grades, not least by Ibrahimovic, who in no less than five attempts alone in the first half was patched and then abandoned after Cavani had used it after the restart.
Nevertheless, he proved much more skillful when he brought his fellow players into the game, and it was a pass by Ibrahimovic that turned Di Maria into a shooting, which was steered past by Wiland in the 52nd minute at the post ...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, so the Uruguayan scored his sixth season goal after Ibrahimovic had fished up a left flank of Maxwell.
This ended all the thoughts that Malmö could return to the game, and only an excellent intervention by Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz, could keep the final score low before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi was able to score a goal in the end.
The coach of Malmö, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class over his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which does not have the same level.
The qualifying games are not enough.”
Hat off to Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore Raises $2.5 Billion Through Stock Sales
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, which is affected by falling commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion on Wednesday through stock sales as part of its huge debt repayment plan.
The London-registered company Glencore said in a statement that it has sold new shares worth about <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion to pay off its own debt.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices, as China’s economic downturn is pushing demand and has a devastating impact on markets.
The issue of subscription rights brought Glencore’s stock price to trading early Wednesday morning a rapid rise to the top of the London Stock Exchange.
The stock jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore had announced last week the $2.5 billion stock sale as part of its broader plans to pay off around a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new stakes at 125 pence per share, which meant a 2.4% discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about long-term slowed growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half, while coal, copper and other commodity prices have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arrive in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon, 49 people reach the city administration in Weimar after a mostly long flight.
The refugees come from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest child is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi’s first official in Washington, will take place on September 25 and will return President Barack Obama’s trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner this evening, after the two leaders have had bilateral talks.
"President Xi's visit will provide the opportunity to extend American-Chinese cooperation on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while also giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to constructively address areas of disagreement," the statement adds.
XI, whose visit was initially announced in February, is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders on his way to Washington in Seattle before continuing to New York City for the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of controversial issues, including Washington’s concerns regarding China’s alleged cyber espionage and its growing self-confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.
440-PS sports car lent and driven to scrap
A 29-year-old wanted to fulfill a dream and borrowed a Ford Mustang.
On the rainy highway came the evil awakening.
At a company in Gotha County, you can fulfill your dream and rent and drive a V8 US sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 hp.
So did a 29-year-old from Gotha County.
On the A 71 near Arnstadt, the dream was then over and over.
The 29-year-old lost control of the sports car, went on a wet road to sling and drove to the steering wheel.
The sports car suffered total damage, no one was injured.
The property damage is estimated at 40,000 euros.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented switch to FC Bayern in 2008
World and European Champion Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
FC Bayern was obviously just a few years ago ahead of the commitment of Spain’s superstar Xavi, who played for FC Barcelona at the time.
Eight times Spanish champion, three times Cup winner, four times Champions League winner, twice Club World Champion, twice European Champion, once World Champion - the title list of Xavi is breathtaking.
In the summer, the now 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar.
However, in an interview with Marca, Xavi now reveals that he was already ahead of the 2008 European Championships before leaving Barcelona.
"I was told that Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a wanted to sell me."
“Madrid won everything, we won nothing,” he says.
It was also registered by FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bayern."
"Rummenigge wanted me."
In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason that Xavi did not change
But the change did not come about.
And the decisive man for this today works for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: “Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a signed Guardiola and I played a great championship.”
"Pep told me that I wouldn't change that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
"That's how he got me."
Who knows how Bayern’s 2008/2009 season would have gone with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter-finals of the Champions League against Bayern over the entire distance on the pitch, turned off the Reds (4:0, 1:1) and ended up celebrating the King-class triumph.
Matt Damon Plays Diversity in Filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes.
During a episode of Sunday Night by HBO’s Project Greenlight, experienced actor Brown interrupted when she stressed the need for alternative perspectives regarding a black protagonist in the project’s chosen screenplay.
“When we talk about diversity, you do it in the cast of the film and not in the cast of the show,” Damon said.
Brown reacted in shock, with insulted disbelief, and shouted "Hoo! Wow. Okay" as the comments of the actor of The Martian got solidified.
Damon and Brown joined fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
“I want to encourage people to think about it — whoever the director will be — how they treat the character of Harmony,” Brown said.
The only black person, and she's a cunt beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People campaigned for finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the film's directorial rights; Damon replied that their director "could end up giving us something we don't want."
After the discussion was broadcast, social media exploded before disapproval over Damon’s comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger at the clip by writing "Matt Damon is talking about the only black person in the room, so he can explain their diversity - that's SO KNOWING that it hurts".
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon’s comments come at a time when exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After the teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement made an impact nationwide, urging lawmakers and authorities to end discriminatory practices against color.
In February, the singer Prince made an allusion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter," (albums still have their meaning) he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have released a statement in response to Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck’s question as to whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love group," the leaders said.
It was recently announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the depiction of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowned first champion
Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and took home the $1 million prize.
The competition show, which just finished its 7th season, had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of its obstacle course.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final.
The last task was to climb a 75-foot-long climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the task within the time, making him the first athlete to complete the strenuous Phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero finished this challenge full three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke with E!News after the hard-won victory, still under the shock of winning the $1 million grand prize.
“I mean, it’s amazing to think about it, I’ve never earned more than $10,000 or had to live,” Isaac E! said about his pile of money.
As suddenly .. as I can't even imagine how that is... the future is unknown.
Lead producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why Britten, although he was the first to finish the course, did not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
“If there’s more than one finalist, it’ll get the one with the fastest time,” Weed said.
How much money is a wonderful price and changes life, it receives the great gratification.
I don't think he has any grudges about it.
He's just so happy to have done what he's done.
He received a lot of awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He is a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be beaten by someone, then I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had swapped the roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an eighth season, the filming will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
They used to be one of the best teams in baseball, today the Tigers are in last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but played this part perfectly against the Minnesota Twins on Tuesday with 5-4 at Target Field.
The Twins wasted a chance to rise within half of the Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard spot.
For Detroit, though only for one night, it was a return of the three-letter F-word that was so hard to grasp over much of the second half of the season.
“All wins are fun no matter how it comes,” said Tigers manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) beat up 6 times in the 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
“I want to end strongly this year,” Simon said.
It’s hard to throw every game in the bullpen, so I want to go into the game with a lot of focus.
Designated Tiger hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez’s first three-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He has swung the log well," said Ausmus.
He looked good at (beat training), looked much better in the bullpen, and he brought it directly into the game.
With three runs behind at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance of getting back into the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left field line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks hit a bunch, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to the strikeout before being replaced by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy survived the wall, the only man he was confronted with, in front of the designated rookie batsman Miguel Sano, who stripped right-handed Drew Verhagen of a two-run.
With a pair of runners and the final round at second, Verhagen brought the third baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the 27th time in the Major League that Plouffe beat a double play.
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth innings, Wall created an RBI double against the closer of the Tigers Bruce Rondon and scored 5-4.
The right-hander, however, outscored Sano at three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited from the opening of the game by an unmovable Phil Hughes.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran, who had been removed from the injury list before the game after missing more than a month due to a back injury.
“Obviously not the start I wanted,” Hughes said, “but I felt more comfortable than I started and felt like I was going to create some pretty good pitches there in the third inning.”
After receiving the leadoff batter in the first, Hushes released a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, who created a single "up the middle" on the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez made his 0-21 success series with the runners in the scoring position.
The third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, making another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game as he tried to get to the third, which ended the threat.
The Tigers finished second, scoring a one-out double from Catcher James McCann and a two-out single from center fielder Anthony Gose for 3-0.
“That was a big blow,” said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't beat very well, but he caught the right spot.
Hughes was in a pitch-count, scoring no points in the third inning before being replaced by Reliever right-handed A.J.Achter.
Hughes scored three runs on six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez resigned due to an injury to the throwing shoulder.
He is being investigated by Dr. James Andrews, who operated the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the injured list since mid-August due to a shoulder strain, is scheduled to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is removed from the injury list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four starts with the Tigers since being acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30
He has been missing since August 20 due to a strain in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and the Twins will end their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota's RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees to be sheltered in Wiesbaden
A train carrying hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hesse.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people who arrived in it will then be accommodated in emergency shelters in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening.
She was expecting 450 to 750 arriving refugees.
Several sports halls of the Hessian state capital had been prepared for this case in recent days.
Up to 1,000 refugees can be accommodated there temporarily.
They should then be distributed to other municipalities.
In the last ten days alone, 7,500 people had arrived in Hesse, according to the government bureau responsible for the initial admission of Giessen.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency shelters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military action in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German involvement in Syria a possibility.
“I believe that decisive reflection on military action options should not take place without Germany,” he said.
He accused the European states of "collective looking away".
Four years ago, we were glad that the cup of military participation in Germany had passed.
“Now the conflict is crashing on our doorstep,” he said on Deutschlandfunk.
The former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for the refugees.
Austria Controlled at Southern and Eastern Borders
After Germany, Austria has again introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV channel ORF that no one will be sent back to Hungary.
Germany has also not sent refugees back to Austria.
“No, that’s agreed,” she said.
On the question of an agreement for which Germany could take up a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said there had already been discussions in this regard between the Director General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not name any specific figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees had come to Austria via the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Your goal is usually Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU heads of state and government, applied for a special summit next week.
Germany had begun temporary border controls on Sunday.
EU countries have so far not been able to agree on a common approach to the crisis.
The EU’s interior ministers will take a new approach to the binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees at a special meeting next Tuesday (22 September).
In view of the strong refugee sands in Germany, the federal government wants to support the countries more strongly in the initial admission and distribution of people.
The Federation will manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of talks with the Prime Minister at the Chancellery in Berlin.
Merkel stressed that the people who need protection also deserve it.
But those who do not have a living perspective cannot stay in Germany either.
This view was clearly shared in the round.
The chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a "great effort of force".
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
Hungary closed its 175-kilometer border with Serbia on Tuesday night.
A few hours later, the Budapest government announced that it would also close the border with Romania with a fence.
This neighbouring country, unlike Serbia, belongs to the EU.
Hungary wants to prevent tractors from looking for escape routes over Romania, Hungary’s Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto told the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut the fence.
According to eyewitness reports, thousands more migrants were on their way to the Greek border in Turkey.
Space probe Cassini finds ocean on Saturn's moon Enceladus
Under the icepan of Saturn’s moon Enceladus, a global ocean swoops.
This concludes researchers from observations of the Cassini spacecraft.
Thus, the moon easily tumbles around the ring planet on its path.
This tumbling movement is only small, but still too large for a solid celestial body, according to a message from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, on Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal "Icarus".
It has long been known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus.
As early as 2006, Cassini had discovered ice volcanoes at the southern pole of Saturn's moon, which spew water vapor and ice particles and thus feed the so-called e-ring of Saturn.
At least at the South Pole there must be an underground sea, the astronomers closed at that time.
However, the extent of the hidden ocean was not clear.
Rama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich must give up about a month to offensive guard Valdet Rama.
An investigation has resulted in an adductor injury to the 27-year-old, the association said.
Rama had already complained about pain at the beginning of the week.
According to Münchner Löwen, the diagnosis means "predictably four weeks foreclosure".
"It's hard for us, Rama is a terrible loss."
"Of course, we need to think now," said sports director Necat Aygün of the "Bild" newspaper in view of the possible commitment of an unifying professional.
As a training guest, however, the Sixties initially presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was previously also under contract with VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croatian currently has "the opportunity to prove his skills".
Goalkeeper Rubin Okotie will be able to return to team training next week after his concussion.
Already on Thursday the Austrian national player is scheduled to enter the running training.
Okotie had injured himself in the game at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) in a violent clash on his head.
Contrary to initial fears, however, he remained without a serious blessing.
No diet fruit - Mangos contain a lot of sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But those who want to pay attention to their lean line are often more discouraged by them.
Because mangoes contain relatively much sugar - especially sucrose.
The exotic fruits are nevertheless healthy: they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. However, mangoes contain a lot of vitamin A and its precursor beta-carotene.
Those who eat the fruits thus support vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying, mangos should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant.
The shell color alone does not tell you how ripe the fruit is - so green mangos can also taste very tasty.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or in sweet dishes.
However, a mango also gives hearty dishes a special touch.
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as chicore and radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
UPS is hiring up to 95,000 people for its Christmas business in the US.
The company has already started recruiting seasonal workers, UPS said on Tuesday.
Drivers are mainly sought.
Last year, UPS had already increased its staff by 95,000 for the holiday season.
In the face of the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been making arrangements since last year to be ready for the Christmas business.
In 2013, late deliveries had brought harsh criticism to parcel services.
First Föhnsturm, then striking cold front
The next night, the valleys of the north side of the Föhn Alps break through, as Meteoschweiz announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and at night until Thursday, the hair dryer blows partly with storm strength through the hair dryers.
After Föhnende on Thursday morning, a striking cold front crosses us, bringing heavy rains, wind gusts and a temperature drop.
As MeteoNews writes in a statement, Switzerland is currently at the forefront of an extensive low-pressure area across the British Isles in a strong south-westerly current.
On the north side of the Alps, the Föhn breaks through the valleys during the night to Wednesday.
As a result, the hair dryer blows until Thursday morning in the hair dryers with gusts of 60 to 100 km/h, isolated and especially in the Urnerland partly also with over 100 km/h.
In some places, the hair dryer can penetrate into the neighbouring central country, and on the mountains even hurricane buoys of over 120 km/h are possible.
While in the north on Wednesday, stormy hair dryers provide summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees, the humidity on the alpine south slope begins to stagnate.
This is where rain starts, which lasts until Thursday evening.
In total, south of the Alps, over 100 litres of rain per square metre will have to be expected in the next 48 hours, after large amounts of rain have already fallen in the last few days.
On Thursday morning, the hair dryer goes out of the air, as a result, a cold front with strong, partly weathered rain rolls from west to east over Switzerland.
Together with the cold front, the wind rises strongly to stormy, and the temperatures go back significantly.
The following days present in the north autumn with 15 to 20 degrees, while in the south it becomes sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees on the weekend.
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Nearly 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino, on Wednesday, a previously nameless place in the park on the Oppio hill was baptized in the name of the German reformer.
At the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now honored as "German theologian of the Reformation".
The park is located in the middle of ancient Rome right next to the Colosseum.
The naming was requested by the working community of the evangelical churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome, recalled on Wednesday that Protestants in the city of the Popes could often live their faith as a minority for centuries only in secret.
The square symbolically shows that its tradition of the Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) stayed in Rome for several months as a young Augustinian monk at the turn of the year 1510/11.
He saw the city at that time as a depraved scapegoat.
His negative impressions may have strengthened him, according to historians, in his later struggle against Rome.
Luther had then, with his theses against the indulgence trade, initiated the division of the Western Church.
Hammer artist invested three years in personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (golden) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Otmar Alt has painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not with the Otmar-Alt-Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent pictures.
In the beginning was the picture for Otmar Alt, who in 150 motifs formulated his very personal interpretations of Bible stories on paper and canvas.
His "language" with colorful colors and imaginative forms has been preserved by the 75-year-old - which is by no means synonymous with "funny" pictures.
On the contrary: adapted to the respective topics, this can seem quite gloomy.
About three years ago, Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project, for which he made a subjective-artistic selection from the many topics of the book of all books.
Cycles are created that focus on topics such as the way of the cross, plagues, commandments or our fathers.
He thus spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther-Verlag with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler-Verlag with its focus on art books.
And there is above all the author Klaus Altepost, who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting.
He has interpreted the Bible passages selected by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" into the present day, in current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Alt’s painting.
They are embedded between Martin Luther’s original Bible quote and each one a sentence of the artist, who formulates here his very personal thoughts on the respective situation.
The jewelry cover has golden letters.
Thus, the 75-year-old twice allows a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high degree of intimacy.
In the end, emotions were a trigger for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herrnhuter order.
“Education happened with the cane,” recalls Otmar Alt.
"I have tried to work this out, perhaps to deal with the Lord Father again."
His second concern is to help art become more important again in a fast-paced time: "The perception of visual worlds today is shaped by advertising, and it is loud.
Symbolism is suppressed there.
Artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things.
Images always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this regard, I am a dinosaur".
Otmar Alt wants viewers to "fall in" the pictures, let them act on themselves, discover and feel the power they have: "The image seeks its counterpart".
Klaus Altepost confessed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt-Bible in the Otmar-Alt Foundation, "always" to have been a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures".
Old did not care to fully grasp the Bible, but rather chose the mysterious topics that were important to him.
"This was not a collaboration at eye level," says Altepost: "This is about the pictures, the text merely explains".
For Hans Möhler of the Luther publishing house, this work is an invitation to "deepen his life and find freedom".
Otmar Alt’s images speak for millers both the (biblical) language of love and that of responsibility.
Part of the originals - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition, which will be opened on 15 November at the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung.
Construction start for BMX train nears
Plans made, space found, company commissioned, earth mound modelled for a round course: A year later almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BMX-Bahn it was already over.
Failures in politics and administration caused confusion, especially among residents who did not want to tolerate the train.
So hill pushed off, new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit.
The permit will be received in October, the First Councillor Sabine Mosebach-Bock was now able to inform the Children and Youth Committee.
"I hope that this year is still visible," she said.
The work on the former indoor swimming pool should then be started without a "further memorial break".
DFB intensifies commitment to refugees
The DFB is expanding its commitment to refugees until 2019, and the Bundesliga is setting a clear signal at the weekend.
Football responds to the growing situation in Germany and assures politics of its help in coping with the upcoming problems.
“I think this is the biggest challenge facing our country since reunification.”
“No one can say, in principle, that’s none of my business, I have nothing to do with it.”
“It must be of interest to everyone to get this topic under control,” said DFB CEO Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I'm next Wednesday at the Chancellery and I'll meet the Minister of State Mrs. <0xC3><0x96>zo<0xC4><0x9F>uz and the Chancellor."
“The issue will certainly play a central role,” he announced.
Football can and wants to help.
However, the decisive course has to be followed by politics.
The German Football Federation has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" by four years.
“Through the Egidius Brown Foundation, we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019,” Niersbach said at the UEFA meeting in St. Julian’s/Malta.
There are also some federalists who support this program.
Already this weekend, the 36 professional clubs set a clear mark when they will wear the imprint "We help - #refugeeswelcome" on the left jersey sleeve instead of the otherwise usual sponsor logo (Hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can," said Leverkusen's sports director Rudi Völler of the "Bild"-Zeitung (Tuesday) and described the project as "self-evident".
"The refugee drama is going on everybody, no one is allowed to look away."
“We football allies can, no, we have to use our ray power, our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly,” said Hertha manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's managing director Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the league".
This Friday, the women’s national team invites 100 refugees to Halle/Saale.
Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a great collaborative work of German football".
The fact that all 36 licensing associations have started their own projects in their respective locations is great.
It is just as great that small and smallest clubs are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome" that we have spent is lived in football.
“This is of enormous importance,” he said.
In this year and next year, the association, together with the DFB-selection and the Federal Government, will provide EUR 300 000 each for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already retrieved the entire sum for 2015," Niersbach reported.
Reports: SAP CEO loses an eye in an accident
The CEO of Europe’s largest software company, Bill McDermott, has reportedly lost his left eye due to a fall in early July.
In the accident on the stairs in his brother’s house in the US, he had fallen on a glass of water after midnight, which he had worn in his left hand, reports the “Economic Week” on Wednesday.
"He's almost bleeding, was powerless, then dragged himself out onto the street - that's what he told us last week," said SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
McDermott can do his job.
“At the beginning of October, we will meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf,” Plattner said.
The 54-year-old manager was present at the meeting and "fully able to work".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Süddeutsche Zeitung) that he would return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group.
"I'm full of SAP, full of my job."
"Of course, I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman Hasso Plattner all the time," McDermott told the SZ.
McDermott usually commutes between Germany and the USA, but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
“It’s important to him to go public with such a personal story,” the SZ manager said, “anyone can do that.”
"It's important to get up again when you fall down."
McLaren replacement pilot Magnussen out of combat ...
Magnussen tweeted a corresponding photo and stated that he had suffered the injury when he fell off the bike.
He therefore does not qualify for the Singapore night race at the weekend as a reserve driver for the two regular pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, as well as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan.
Football: BVB without a giant against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in the gate
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes for a comeback by Marco Reus in the first group match of the Europa League have finally broken.
The national player will also be missing the leader of the Bundesliga in the duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19:00/Sky).
“Unfortunately, we can’t rely on him,” Thomas Tuchel said on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga top match against Leverkusen, the BVB coach left open: "We expect him to return to training on Friday".
Given the high burden of its professionals, Tuchel will not only change his tribal elf at the Reus position.
So he announced a change in the goalkeeper position.
That is why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of regular keeper Roman Bürki.
"He's training at an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
However, Tuchel left open whether Weidenfeller will be used in all Europa League matches in the future.
He is also likely to contest the second game.
Reus’s research statement that the final move for the BVB in the Europa League must be the goal, midfielder Julian Weigl considers comprehensible: “This is not so wrong with Marco.”
"I think we have a good chance to take the title."
Robotic cars: government wants pioneer role for Germany
Germany is supposed to be technological pioneers in the transformation of the car according to the will of the German government.
On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which provides, among other things, for investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Automesse IAA about a "new mobility era".
Automated and networked driving will increase road safety and reduce congestion, Dobrindt said.
He also wants to discuss the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries, who also meet with representatives of industry at the IAA.
The Ministry of Transport’s strategy paper highlights, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid switch to digital radio.
In order to test new technology, a test track is currently being created on the motorway 9 in Bavaria.
In order for the driver to "not be burdened with any additional liability risks", the Federal Government wants to "check the legal framework conditions and, where necessary, adapt them to the new developments".
For example, Germany wants to work internationally to ensure that the maximum permitted speed for self-driving cars is increased from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour.
The German government also wants to work towards an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
In automated driving, the car increasingly takes the lead, the driver becoming more and more a passenger.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, driverless vehicles on public roads are “expected to be far beyond 2020.”
The authors of the study estimate the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the German location to be around EUR 8.4 billion for 2025.
“The digital connectivity of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic,” said SPD traffic politician Sören Bartol.
However, the question of liability in the event of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clarified.
However, the Germans still see self-driving cars as skeptical – much more so than French or Americans.
A survey by the Forsa Institute on Wednesday on behalf of the testing organization Dekra concludes that only 8% of Germans believe autonomous driving cars will prevail in the next ten years, 32 percent only expect it in 20 years, 31 percent don’t believe it at all.
In France, 21% of respondents expect autonomous cars by 2025, while in the US 33%.
In any case, drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey by the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to hand over control throughout the journey on all roads.
On the highway, this could at least be 15 per cent in the flow of traffic, 45 per cent in the traffic jam.
Well, every fourth would not leave the car in control under any circumstances.
Boll cancels team and double start at Table Tennis EURO
According to the current state of affairs, the Düsseldorfer only wants to pitch in individual in the title battles from 25 September to 4 October.
The final decision is to be made by 22 September at the latest.
“This is a huge loss for our team.”
“The boys found out in the morning.”
“But we are strong enough to win the title even without Timo,” said German coach Jörg Ro<0xC3><0x9F>kopf during the European Championships in Düsseldorf.
Boll was on the flight at that time to a long-term agreed sponsorship appointment in China.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected to return on Friday.
“Without Timo, the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favourite,” said European Champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who leads the set list in Yekaterinburg, also recalled the 2013 European Championships in Schwechat.
"At the time, Timo was also missing, and we have become European champions."
“We should be guided by that,” declared the World Rankings Fifth.
English football player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury to his right leg.
In the Champions League match at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit in a tackle by Héctor Moreno and replaced after long treatment.
The first diagnosis indicated a shin fracture in Bastian Schweinsteiger’s 20-year-old co-star.
Gaultier Feels Too Old for an Enfant Terrible
It is a mix of very large fashion show and a wax figure grussel cabinet: Designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition about his work in Munich on Wednesday.
The highlights: mannequins that look terrifyingly human thanks to video projections.
They carry the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, became the great star of the fashion scene with Madonna’s stage outfits – and with him putting men in skirts.
"I can no longer say today that I am the enfant terrible of the haute couture because I have white hair."
“It used to be bleached, now it’s real,” Gaultier said.
For the visitors of the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From Bürgersteig on the runway), which can be seen from September 18th in the art hall of the Hypo-Kulturstiftung, it is a good thing that the fashion designer has changed his initially reluctant attitude towards a show about his person.
Actually, he was against it, because, "For me, an exhibition sounded a bit like death," he said.
When you die, you come to the museum.
The impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the man’s work, which is hardly yet to be overlooked, who has written fashion history without ever having completed an education.
Chronologically, the show is not structured, but it is an excellent choreographed work of art, for which a lot of effort has been made: In order to freeze the dolls, for example, a stylist was specifically engaged.
According to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, 14 tons of material have been carted to Munich.
Just before the start of the Oktoberfest there was a special treat: a leather pants outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and for people who are a bit different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier’s old Teddy can also be seen in the exhibition.
He stands for the designer’s first, timid, fashionable walking attempts.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in football) he put on his Teddy bras and clothes, Gaultier said.
Playing with a doll would not have allowed his parents.
He later taught himself how to design fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
I bought them later, of course.
For his first fashion show, he couldn’t pay for the models.
They got nothing, but were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewelry instead of curtain - Plauen lace as a fashion niche
In the past, the long embroidery machines in and around Plauen were about making meters.
The embroidered fabrics and laces were created in large quantities for customers who, for example, processed them into ceilings and curtains.
This alone no longer works, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of the Plauen fashion brand.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early days of the Plauener Spitze, fashion played a greater role, was then displaced by the home textile industry – and is now rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt mentions a few examples: lace in jewelry, in accessories such as bags and in regional costumes.
In general, the so-called vintage fashion, which is based on past style weeks, represents an increasing order potential.
Anyone who does not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market.
With us, they already make up half of all orders.
Modespitze Plauen, together with nine other companies, is a member of the industry association Plauener Spitze und Embroideryen.
Only you can wear the protected label.
Over the past 15 years, around 80 percent of sales have broken away.
There are almost no more private shops and also the wholesale.
Our products hardly reach the customer in this way.
The bulk goods are now produced much cheaper in the Asian region and almost exclusively distributed via chains.
Exports to Russia and the United States are also weakening.
Enough reasons for new ways.
The industry association is also trying to score points through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer of the embroidery bead in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year we have a quality seal that shows that we produce ecologically and socially compatible".
Reinhardt adds: "This also applies to the materials used".
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger branch of the West Saxon University of Applied Arts Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroidery and lace.
In order to counter competition from the Asian region, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think above all economically," Schmidt says.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied to maintain a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball peak.
The machine sticks small balls in some places.
The Plauen goldsmith master Bianca Hallebach-Kra<0xC3><0x9F>e was inspired by this: "Before I could do nothing with traditional Plauen lace".
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate process, it shapes the pattern in silver.
“Many people in the region identify with the topic of plauener Spitze – young and old,” Reuter says.
It also delivers to the United States, Australia and Finland – especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Plauen and the surrounding area and who want a memento.
With this, I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauener Spitze.
Disney plans new "Mary Poppins" movie
Legends are not to be touched, but Disney is still waiting for a new film of his classic "Mary Poppins".
According to Entertainment Weekly, however, it is not about a re-filming, but about a kind of sequel that plays with the magical nanny 20 years after the first film.
It’s about Nanny’s experiences with the Banks family in times of the world economic crisis in England.
Anyone who plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already stuck: Rob Marshall, most recently with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi urges to open the economy wider to the world
The economy needs to open wider outwards to promote growth, said President Xi Jinping on Tuesday, a group tasked with steering the reform.
“China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and know-how and improving business start-up strategies,” he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership Group for deepening comprehensive reform.
Promoting new start-ups and advancing reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The leadership group has adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list to regulate market access, relaxation of border control policies, promotion of state enterprises (SOE), private capital, and overhaul of the population reporting system.
According to the statement, a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved by test programs.
The initiative is important as it assigns a greater role to the market in allocating resources, ensuring a state-of-the-art business environment and making the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also loosen controls on the powers transferred to the companies and ensure that companies decide how to run their businesses.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As part of an offer to open up state-controlled sectors, further areas of private investment will be opened up.
“The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services for them,” the statement said.
In addition, it is made easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimizing the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to guarantee, exercise their activities and use professional judges and public prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting also included Premier Li Keqiang and key leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement released after the meeting.
EU plans to double mercury limit in predatory fish
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predatory fish, thus suggesting a significantly higher dose of nerve poison to consumers.
The consumer organization Foodwatch, which has a corresponding EU working paper, strongly criticized the plans: "Risks and side effects of misguided industrial and environmental policies are being passed on to pregnant women and young children with full force," explained Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limits of the nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish, are to be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish for "economic reasons."
However, large predatory fish are already so heavily burdened with mercury that, on the basis of the limits still in force, about 50 percent of catches are not allowed to be sold.
After doubling the limit values, only 14.5 percent would be unsaleable.
In return for this easing, according to Foodwatch, the EU wants to tighten the limits for other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Foodwatch, however, called this a “trick” because smaller Friedfish, such as Carp, are usually so low that they already meet the planned peaks today.
The reduction in small fish is therefore “a perfidious distraction maneuver that helps the economy alone,” Wolfschmidt explained.
Mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans, which is highly enriched by the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
The federal government therefore warns that “already small amounts, especially in the case of unborn babies, can cause damage to the nervous system.”
However, the Federal Ministry of the Environment declares on its homepage with regard to the current maximum levels that a "health hazard to the general population" is not to be expected.
Mercury comes into the environment mainly through the burning of coal.
According to a written statement by the Federal Ministry of the Environment, the German coal-fired power plants emit more than six tonnes of mercury a year to the Greens-Bundestag MP Annalena Baerbock, two thirds of the total quantity emitted in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example, in the Elbe, Rhine and Danube, was "permanently and extensively exceeded," the "mirror" quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, Europe-wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RASFF.
