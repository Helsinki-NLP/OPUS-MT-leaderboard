Food to blame for European inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation measured in the euro area is the rapidly rising food prices.
In the 13 euro area countries, the inflation rate in November was higher than expected - according to the 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was recorded, according to the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts are only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Contrary to the American, British, and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the leitzsins; in its discretion, the reduction in interest rates would favour the rise in commodity prices and the slight fall in unemployment, the emergence of an inflation spiral.
The ECB strives to keep inflation rates below two percent, or at least close to the two percent mark.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in the middle of the gap: inflation must be "agreed" to exclude future need for action.
With 3.3 per cent, the inflation rate reached a 12-year high in Germany in November; in Spain, the rate climbed from 3.6 to 4.1 per cent.
The increase in inflation in the euro area is responsible for the rise in food and energy prices.
The MATIF wheat quotations rose by 88 percent, and the price for soybeans also reached a record high since 1973.
Food oil and dairy products were also subject to considerable inflation in 2007.
The world market price for crude oil rose by 52 percent this year – last month, the price per barrel of black gold reached almost $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 to 2.5 percent in 2008, but is expected to fall to 1.9 percent in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts expect a 3-percent inflation rate, but the annual average rate is 2.1 per cent.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to lower interest rates twice.
Gallup locates government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathizers has grown considerably by the beginning of December, the party having the largest base camp since 2002, while the approval of the socialists has reached an unprecedented low of 13 percent, according to Gallup.
In the case of the party-faith voters, the difference is clear thanks to the high determination of the opposition supporters: more than two-thirds (71 percent) are opposed to a fifth (20 percent) of the approval of the MSZP.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are below the parliamentary threshold of entry: they reach two percent in the total population.
The number of party voters has grown by one percent in both camps.
Compared to the last low, the general economic mood has further deteriorated - never before was the proportion of those who judge the country's economic situation as "extremely bad" so high (41%), while another 46% consider it "pretty bad".
After more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, the families again see the change in their financial situation more pessimistic.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects a further deterioration of the situation; only one-tenth expects improvement.
A Gallup poll conducted in December found that 71% of respondents - a historic high - judged the Prime Minister's work as "rather bad than right."
Thirteen percent of respondents have great confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcs<0xC3><0xA1>ny, while the share of supporters for Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n is 38 percent.
About 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared with 27% distrust of the party leader of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of political sentiment is the number of those who believe that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister could be managed even without a change of government.
If, after the riots last October, 35% of the government and the head of government were to remain, that share now amounts to only 20%, while the relative majority (33 percent) sees the solution only in new elections.
Asked about their interest in the popular vote, 60 percent responded that they would participate "with certainty" and another 20% would "probably" cast their vote.
In comparison, if the parliamentary elections were to take place on this Sunday, only 55 percent would go "safely" to the polls, another 15% would consider their participation "probably". In view of these trends, the result of the referendum would be foreseeable.
74% would vote against the tuition fees, 79% against the practical fee, and 84% against the hospital daily fee.
Switched to the group of participants in the referendum "with certainty" the proportion of opponents of the study, practice and hospital fees would be 81, 84, and 89 percent respectively.
Auchan the most expensive, Tesco increases by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs trading area also maintained the average price increase of 16% from last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Articles by Napi Gazdas<0xC3><0xA1>g
In the Budaörs trading triangle, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" has also increased by 16 percent this year, but price increases of over 1,000 HUF have been registered in all hypermarkets.
After prices in the food markets have "gapped" last December, the inflation rate has not been drastic in percentage terms, compared to the already high, earlier initial level.
However, it certainly has an appalling effect on consumers that what they paid for last year, well below 9,000 HUF, is not even available for 10,000 HUF this year.
The price of the "Napi" shopping cart exceeded the magical 10,000 HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the investigated markets.
The highest price was HUF 10,573.
(In 6800 the price was 6,800 HUF.)
Prices for unicum and live fish remained close to the previous year’s level, while prices for turkey breast fillets, nut and poppy rose sharply.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but at Auchan there were 1kg of breadshakes for 139 forints.
There was no competitive price drop on the product to below 200 forints.
Also surprising was the price of a two litre Coca-Cola deposit bottle of less than 200 forints, so the drink including deposit cost only 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, this year in the "Napi" shopping cart comparison Auchan was the most expensive, and Cora the cheapest.
Our calculations have shown that Cora has increased prices in the "Napi" shopping cart by 15 compared to the Christmas prices last year, while Tesco and Auchan have increased by 18 percent each.
The difference between the cheapest shopping basket of the previous year and the most expensive one of the current year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest shopping basket of the previous year and the most expensive one of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was HUF 1,480.00.
The average price increase in the previous year was 1,206.00 Forint, but the VAT increase in prices at last Christmas was noticeable.
This is exactly what happened in the trade: apparently the department stores could not quite decide which price range to apply to the individual articles, since the effects of the price increase on consumer behaviour were unforeseeable.
(If the trader plans the speed of circulation of a product poorly, he can fall by substantial gains in the price range, which depends on the traffic intensity.)
Due to VAT, the price of the "Napi" shopping basket last year was so radical that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forint, whereas the price difference for the cheapest basket was only 844 Forint.
This year, such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost 1.630.00 Forint more than in the previous year, and even at the cheapest, there was a price increase of 1,284.00 Forint.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic price increase, the price of daily consumables in the hypermarkets increased by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: In some basic foodstuffs, the Statistical Office found a more than 30% inflation over the period of 12 months.
So about next to flour also in eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" shopping cart, this seems almost impossible with the latter, since the price level of the product already expensive in the previous year has increased by hardly more than 10 percent even in the worst case.
Obviously, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the egg suppliers - after all, they were able to roll off the drastic price increase on the multis.
In the golden trading triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain; it is constantly reported by good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores are no longer looking at the prices.
It is bought from all large quantities, durable foods go in pallets over the store tables.
Wednesday morning there were endless snakes at the cash register in all three department stores when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, the country reports a lower customer rate, so many multis complain to the opinion researchers that they could not even achieve the planned sales, not only for food, but also for sustainable consumer goods.
In many places, disinfectants are saved
This year, more than a thousand infections have been recorded in hospitals due to improper use of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in hospitals, the overcrowding of beds, the overload of staff - all factors that are not exactly conducive to the containment of infections, according to the lead physician of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places, disinfectants are also saved.
In the traumatology department of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Hospital, an MRSA infection has recently been diagnosed.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was found in a male patient who was hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection here.
The injured person in a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital, but a little later the man had to return with an MRSA infection. An important operation has not yet been performed because of the bacterium, which is still in the patient's body.
By December 10, 1094, infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens were reported to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, according to Karolina Böröcz, the lead physician of the National Epidemiology Center.
So many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have been registered in hospitals with certainty, but the dark digit is likely to be higher.
About two-thirds of infections (683 cases) were caused by MRSA, the Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin oxacillin.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about a third of people in their nose without causing a disease.
SA-related infections (such as throat inflammation, tonsillitis, inflammation of the skin or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well curable.
However, if the agents are used too highly or improperly, antibiotics-resistant are produced from the well-responding bacteria, which rapidly spread in hospitals under appropriate conditions.
Especially in patients with weakened, or permanently poorly functioning immune systems, but also in older, or patients with low body weight, these bacteria can cause serious infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Hospital, MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents are part of everyday hospital life.
One must not confuse the infection with the epidemic, Tibor Nyulasi warned - MRSA only does not exist where it is not sought.
Resistant to antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, the caregivers wear rubber gloves and masks in the care, and we have the antibiotics necessary for the treatment" - Tibor Nyulasi.
While patients are being examined for MRSA, an infection cannot always be avoided.
Samples taken too rarely
The majority of MRSA-induced infections in hospitals would be preventable, but the current prevailing conditions and circumstances are unfavorable for the prevention of the emergence or spread of the multi-resistant pathogen, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs predominantly in hospitals and retirement homes, the hospitals should examine the patients who have been hospitalised and isolate MRSA-infected patients immediately.
In Hungarian hospitals, however, microbiological sampling is not practiced as often.
Not least because there are no subsidies for this investigation on the part of the state health insurance company.
Most cases therefore only come to light when the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the epidemiology center.
From the European Union there are strict recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and diseases in Hungary.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, that is, microbiological investigations are necessary so that no resistance to the drug can form, but this directive is not always adhered to by hospitals.
Among the outpatients, or patients in primary care, microbiological samples were even rarer, says Karolina Böröcz.
Saved for disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most often transmitted from one patient to another by the caregiver.
This is precisely why hand washing, or wearing gloves and masks, is of great importance, but there are also significant deficiencies in this area in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted through droplet infection or contact, but in domestic hospitals there is not always the possibility to isolate the infected patient.
The rooms are even often overcrowded, the beds nestled close to each other, although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them from an epidemiological point of view.
As Karolina Böröcz notes further, unfortunately, in the less well-off hospitals, it even happens that disinfectants are saved, there are few caregivers, many patients - all factors that favor the emergence of infections.
Such infections are proven to be far less common there, or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped, where these protective measures are observed, says Karolina Böröcz.
Government program against MRSA
Getting MRSA infections under control causes huge costs to health insurance companies, so they are fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its containment, was recorded in the government program.
After first signs, the program is successful - as published data show, the trend of MRSA infections in England is declining.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has declared the prevention of the development of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals one of its priorities.
Death row police chief was not drunk
In the case of a fatal car accident caused by the police chief of the XXII district, the official opinion is now available.
The now retired police chief of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday, was neither alcoholized nor under the influence of drugs, said Attila Morvai, the press spokesman for the Budapest Supreme Prosecutor’s Office on Friday after the official report was submitted to the case.
The report confirmed the results of the initial investigation, according to which the chief of police had not consumed alcohol before putting himself on the wheel.
The former police chief entered Kossuth Lajos Street with his own car in the XXII district, crossing a 55-year-old man who crossed the street at an unmarked location.
(According to StVO, however, this is not a milder circumstance - the handlebar has, even if pedestrians do not cross the road on the zebra strip, priority.)
The pedestrian is injured after being admitted to the hospital.
According to police reports, the handler suffered a shock, then resigned his functions and requested retirement.
The Budapest Public Prosecutor’s Office has opened its investigation into the incident.
In addition, Attila Morvai mentioned that the former police chief had cooperated with the investigators from the very beginning.
EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three loan agreements in Budapest on Friday, worth EUR 400 million, which are intended to flow into education, transport and environmental infrastructure and the energy economy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for financing transport and environmental protection projects implemented with grants from the Cohesion Fund. The credit agreement of EUR 100 million was already signed earlier and the current agreement concerns the use of the EUR 200 million granted.
The sum of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement will also be spent on the budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary; the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later in the context of the extension of the credit agreement.
In the area of innovation, the contracting parties have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will mainly be implemented in research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
At the meeting, the metro line 4 was also spoken.
It was agreed that once Hungary has clarified the details of metro financing with the EU, the original contract and any modifications will be re-discussed.
According to J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects totalling EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The loan interest is EURIBOR-bound, the loan is provided by the EIB with an extension of 8 years, commission-free.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - the whole of Europe is paying attention to the previously rarely mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who buys in the EU’s still cheapest market, but which is rapidly becoming more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most sought-after patch for property purchases in the Eastern European region, with cheap ski apartments and seaside houses.
Between the mountains, the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, by the sea Albena, the "gold coast", the "sun coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar the racers, but real estate around Kavarna and Balcik are also increasingly in demand.
According to estimates by Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the country’s interior also attracts sooner or later investors, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the extremely favorable area of Russe records more buyers.
The capital city of Sofia also offers tempting offers - commercial and office spaces offer the highest returns.
Bulgaria is on its way to becoming one of the most attractive European golfer paradises, thus attracting tourists in the two other seasons in addition to the summer and winter season.
For this reason, prospective investors are already buying in a large style, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who buy real estate in Bulgaria are also seeking a change in their way of life.
Most buyers are English, but there are also prospects from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers at the Black Sea and in the ski resorts.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle down buy either revitalized properties by 50-100,000 euros, or run-down houses by 5-15.000 euros, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connectivity and accessibility as well as communication opportunities are great written, but also the proximity to a big city, shops and doctors are crucial for the buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed among the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group consists of business people who invest with the aim of a medium- to long-term increase in value.
Real estate in the capital, meanwhile, is becoming increasingly expensive, due to the ever-growing demand.
Within the EU, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the past five years there has been a price increase of 21 percent annually.
The cost of real estate prices far exceeds the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percent
As Minister of the Environment G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries consult on the Bali Roadmap, which sets the emission reduction measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the end of the Kyoto Protocol.
There is currently a fierce debate between developed and developing countries.
The US has already signalled that they do not want to negotiate on concrete figures, but would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other big question of the conference is whether the industrialised countries are ready to support developing countries financially and technologically in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement on the support of developing countries has also been reached.
The adjustment fund under the Kyoto Protocol is to be managed by a 16-member Council, which is expected to be read in the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as in the “Piac és Profit”.
Hungary's 6%
On behalf of Hungary, Minister of the Environment G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor supports the EU’s efforts to maintain its pioneering role in global climate action and to achieve a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (measured at 1990 levels), regardless of whether or not the "Agreement after 2012" will be achieved successfully. The Union would even be willing to commit to a 30% reduction if other major industrialised countries of the world, or developing countries, are also willing to meet their commitments according to forces and responsibly.
G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor stressed that the objective of the states that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2 percent, whereas the EU and its 15 member states had already committed themselves to a reduction of 8%.
Hungary's target is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to 1985-87 - a target that the country will fully meet, as can be seen in the Ministry of the Environment's press release.
The effort is high in Bali - after all, the long-term international climate agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly not come into force until after 2012. In this case, the reduction project set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a new, international emission reduction system, the importance of which has also been highlighted by the IPCC, the international, with the Nobel Peace Prize-winning scientific climate change committee of the UN.
As a result, the emission reduction would be delayed, and the increase in the Earth’s average temperature by more than 2°C would be unavoidable, which scientists say would have extremely serious and irreparable consequences.
British Army advertises on YouTube
Units of the British Army have published footage of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in order to increase popularity on the video portal.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) discovered YouTube for itself: Special forces stationed in Afghanistan have been loading videos about Taliban-led operations into the network since March 2006, the BBC reports.
Shots shot with helmet-mounted miniature cameras are controlled at the Air Force base in Kandahar and then sent to London, where they are placed on the Internet.
Political message inevitable
Soldiers of the Air Force have already contributed 139 such recordings, their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered under "defenseheadquarters" in spring 2007 to publish videos about Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Foreign Ministry (Commonwealth Office) and the Iraq-based international peacekeeping forces (MNFI) have their own YouTube channels.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally, the Luftwaffe published the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and, as the Ministry of Defence says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population about the actual goals of foreign missions.
Propaganda of this kind is almost free compared to conventional television advertisements, defence expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC, but these videos always carry a certain level of political message in them, as they confirm the existence of the military measures decided by the government in their own way.
U.S. Advertise With Game
However, the army must also fight amateur shots, which, in addition to the carefully edited, censored shots, also make it on the net - such as those that show the death of the soldiers: in the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the losses are spoken at most, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
Of the war scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan, by the way, numerous videos filmed in use have already been uploaded to the platform, but this "genus" has only recently been discovered by the British for themselves.
The Americans, however, advertise in a slightly different way, namely with the free downloadable shooting game "America's Army", in which the player can slip into the soldier's skin as part of a more or less lifelike simulation.
Christmas party with Tombola and Pogatsche in the Ministries
Minister of Labour M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth is by no means timid: instead of a Christmas celebration, she organizes a work conference in which her employees can finish the year 2007 with coffee and pogatsche.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others conjure up Christmas spirit with Tombola or spurs into the official hearts.
Party, Christmas mood, concerts and buffet - this is how the power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already taken over the offices.
The largest Christmas celebration of a ministry is held in the defense area this year, but the ministry staff are not expected to do so.
At the "Christmas celebration of orphans" children are gifted by fallen soldiers, at the "Mission celebration" family members are hosted by soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The resort provides around 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other departments, the National Agency for Development (NF<0xC3><0x9C>) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport are hitting the strings.
The 4.32 million Forint expensive Christmas party of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is held in the House of the Future, about 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
The focus of the celebrations is on Christmas, but there will also be live acts and a raffle.
The National Agency for Development (NF<0xC3><0x9C>) held its 4.7 million Forint expensive Christmas party on Wednesday at the House of the State Judicial Council (OIT), with concerts and a festive dinner.
The room rental was 1 million forints, the rest was spent on the more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, a department of the NF<0xC3><0x9C> is also invited to another Christmas party hosted by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
The building of the Lustspieltheater ("V<0xC3><0xAD>gsz<0xC3><0xAD>nh<0xC3><0xA1>z") was rented for the celebration.
MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information, as we have not reached the responsible parties.
Why the suit?
The OIT building was open not only to the guests of the NF<0xC3><0x9C>, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, who held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas party on December 7.
They did not have to pay rent to the OIT for the use of the premises.
About 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a speech from the minister, after the dinner there was live music to dance.
At the request of [origo], it was stated that there was no obligation to wear a ball gown or a suit on the ball.
The ministries of health, work, and self-government are each preparing for Puritan celebration.
The Ministry of Health organizes the celebration for the employees in their own four walls for around 400,000 forints.
Minister of Labour M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth officially invites her employees not to a Christmas party, but to the conference on the end of the year.
It is expected that about 180 guests, who - according to the press department - will only be served with coffee and pogatsche, so the celebration will be 350,000 forints.
Minister of Self-Government Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will just kick in the aula of the ministry.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organizes a Christmas party in its own banquet hall, to which 436 employees are expected.
Expenditure was estimated at 2,500 forints per head - for this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent kick-off.
Since the beginning of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres’ term of office, PM employees have been celebrating this way every year.
However, there will be no real party mood - not only because of the official speech of the minister, but also because the celebration was set for the afternoon.
On the 20th of January, the Ministry of Agriculture invites you to a New Year’s reception, and the Ministry’s Christmas celebration ends this time.
The one hundred guests are invited to the Vajdahunyad Castle in the V<0xC3><0xA1>rosliget (V<0xC3><0xA1>rosliget) park; according to the department, the expenses are estimated at 1,000 forints per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple stand-up reception, to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be charged.
The receptions, which are held every year, traditionally begin with a brief address of the minister and sound with restrained chatter.
As the relevant press outlets report on [origo] request, there will be neither a Christmas party at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs nor at the Ministry of Education.
Asked about the cost of the Christmas celebration, no information could be given to the press department of the Ministry of the Environment.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration, which is held in the Kunstgewerbemuseum.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
The League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Federation of Trade Unions will form their coordination committee on Friday for the indefinite duration of the strike starting on Monday.
On Saturday, a protest general assembly will be held, and on Monday - on the day of the referendum on the Health Insurance Act - the work-reduction begins.
Strike-related, significant traffic barriers are expected, as rail traffic is almost completely stopped, and the Budapest public transport companies (BKV) are also on strike until 1 p.m.
Details of the strike on Monday will be announced jointly by the League of Trade Unions and the Federation of Trade Unions on Friday afternoon.
A LIGA-MOSZ strike committee will also be set up, which will be responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
On Saturday, a protest general assembly will be held, and as of Monday, all organizations that have joined the strike will cease work indefinitely, unless an agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike starting on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act was not defined.
If the National Council does not adopt the Health Insurance Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for a strike.
However, if the law is passed, the strike shots come together to advise on the further action.
On the basis of the National Council's agenda on Monday, it is even conceivable that it will only come to the vote on the Health Insurance Act in the later evening hours, or even at midnight.
As a result of the strikes that begin on Monday, significant traffic barriers will have to be expected: the railways lay down their work for an indefinite period of time, in the morning most of the public transport and more than half of the Vol<0xC3><0xA1>n companies stand still.
At the same time, there will be roadblocks in many places.
The call for strike has followed numerous trade unions and civil organizations - the list of participants is constantly updated on the league website.
Some organizations announced strikes indefinitely, while others are planning a temporary work cut.
Until Thursday afternoon, no agreement could be reached between the Hungarian Railway M<0xC3><0x81>V and the Free Trade Union of the Railways VDSZSZ, although more and more people are travelling by train around the Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, the BKV is striked early from the start of operations until 1 p.m., at Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 a.m., the LIGA trade unions for electricity and heat energy lay down the work for four hours, and the teachers' union, for example, the Democratic Teachers' Union, called for 2 or 2-8 hours of strikes.
The Hungarian Medical Association strikes nationwide at varying times, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Care Workers, a sub-organisation of the SZEF, the Forum for Trade Union Cooperation, holds a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points demanded by the League is that the government withdraws the draft health insurance reform and submits a new concept for social discourse.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due from next year.
The third requirement is that access to the early retirement system will be made available to eligible professional groups before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZZ, which belongs to the League of Trade Unions, has not accepted the offer made by the Ministry of Transport and is now calling for a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases State Risk
According to Political Capital’s Risk Analysis Division, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded this August with the support of the “Movement for a Better Hungary”, have raised the risk of Hungary and the region in several respects.
In connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is the "enhancing of the already existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsies and non-gypsies in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic conflicts in the short term".
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is probably aimed at the provocation of such a dispute, according to the research institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure on the part of the political leaders: "Persons of public life have left the discussion of the Roma question to representatives of radical political groups who have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungary set-up."
It is believed that this would exacerbate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, favour extremities, and increase the likelihood of violent confrontations.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard had, not least thanks to the enormous attention of the domestic and foreign media, "the image of Hungary abroad seriously damaged, especially in terms of confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember that since the fall of 2006, the reorganization of radical and extremely right-wing groups in Hungary has been constantly in the process of resurgence, so that since the summer of 2007, several organizations called the "National Self-Defense Association" have been founded.
"These groupings are common that they each define themselves as a civilian organization, while openly bragging about preparing their members for — sometimes armed — defense tasks (catastrophe protection, state defense, order protection), citing the inadequacy of the police, the army, or the state itself," it said.
And further: all this is done according to the method that tries to disguise various political aspirations as a bourgeois initiative based on the political and party-distortedness of the population.
The emphasis on the civil character and the form of association is therefore not only used to circumvent legal hurdles that could arise in the course of registration in court - it is also a political strategy.
As can be seen from the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-enhancing factor for relations with neighbouring countries.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring states, so some ultra-nationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries see the creation of the Hungarian Guard as confirming its own anti-Hungary policy.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region," it said.
From the perspective of the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central-Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the entire region has grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose foundation was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the Bulgarian Guards were the Roma mass riots that took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU has taken the incidents directly to the occasion of the establishment of the National Guard, arguing that the aim of the organization is "national protection".
In their opinion, a real “gypsy terror” in Bulgaria has been felt in the past 17 years, but the state has remained indifferent and indifferent – according to Political Capital.
The initiative would have sparked a fierce debate in the Bulgarian public.
As I said, the increased risk of ethnic conflicts is also evidenced by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced to establish their own guard for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard have so far shown many similarities to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be ruled out that the Hungarian Roma also react to the threats by organizing their own protection, according to the Risk Warning Report of Political Capital.
Attila Juh<0xC3><0xA1>sz, Research Director at Political Capital, said at the request of the news agency: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Annually, risk analysis reports would be published, and should risk-altering trends be discernible, public opinion will be informed, as in the case of the release of the risk warning report.
Holidays aren’t everywhere holidays
In Hungary, holidays are strictly regulated by law, so that the practice of re-disposing the working days around the holidays has now become established, but the coming year will give us less such days.
Also in the EU and in America, something else is understood as "celebrity day".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between public holidays and work-free days.
Work-free days are usually ecclesiastical holidays, or are related to significant historical events.
For example, we also celebrate New Year: both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are work-free days – the latter alone so that the New Year’s celebrations can rest.
Throughout the year we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The state holidays are March 15th, which commemorates the Revolution of 1848, and October 23rd, the Memorial Day of the Revolution of 1956.
On the 20th of August, the founding of the state, on the 1st of May, the work is celebrated, on the 1st and 2nd of November, we commemorate our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays to Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas each.
Since our state, national, or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of “working day shift” has proven itself in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price of extended weekends, however, is that we have to work very well on Saturdays before, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is ultimately to be worked out, the Minister of Labour has for many years set out in his own decree.
The legislation applies to all employers and employees, to public servants and civil servants alike.
Exceptions are only companies and facilities in which the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. also on public holidays.
This year, the working order is only somewhat confused by the holidays at the end of the year: from December 24th, life in this country remains formal, since most of the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve take time off, or take the specially cancelled holiday.
In the next year, more holidays fall into the middle of the week, or to the end of the week, so that there will be fewer re-disposals on the working days than this year.
The calendar is first "turned upside down" around the day of work so that people can stay at home for four days at a time.
Saturday, April 26th will be a working day so that Friday, May 2nd can be a rest day.
The second re-disposal is related to the holiday on 23 October: On Saturday, 18 October you will have to finish the Friday, 24 October in advance.
The end of the year, however, will be completely marked by the holidays, after from December 24 everything will lie and remain, even if New Year’s Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six Terrifying Little Things to Worry About Your Workmates
Emails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive - harmless lies that no longer stand out: they bring "color" to everyday life in the workplace.
The only question is whether you get used to these little inconveniences, or you better face the challenge and consciously try to avoid these misunderstandings for other annoying situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone called from the marketing department," a colleague says.
Did you miss a meeting?
At best, you regret it and try to make amends by perhaps calling the marketing department and humbly confessing that you had forgotten to align the message (this is the less common method).
Most of the time, the case is dismissed with an apology.
Before engaging in embarrassing excuses, one should consider how to truly create unpleasant moments for one’s colleagues and try to avoid these situations consciously.
Borrowing something that doesn’t belong to you?
There’s hardly anything more nerve-wracking than grabbing a document, office supplies, or the phone, but it’s not there.
Yesterday the stapler was still on the desk - this morning it's gone?
Or is the lost ballpoint pen discovered on a colleague’s desk?
Without questions, you should not borrow anything from your colleagues, because they are rightly annoyed when they find that something has gone away.
So, don't put envelopes or post-it out of the office in your pocket, because it could hit you yourself: no more if you need it urgently.
Talk about the private life of colleagues?
There is no effective means of stopping a bargain that has already been made in the world.
Who did what with whom?
Where and why?
One should not tie the information (or conjectures) about the private life of colleagues to the nose if possible!
And if someone opens up and tells us his inner secret, we should not abuse that trust!
It is best to remain silent like a grave, rather than directing those who are not present, even if others are aware of the problems of the colleague.
Reported sick for no reason?
If you call in the office to report sick, citing painful headaches, because you just feel uncomfortable, or just want to rest, you should be aware of one thing: your own work, inadvertent completions, projects with fixed deadlines now have to be done by your colleagues instead of by yourself.
So don't play bad with your colleagues!
If you know the day before that you will not be able to get into the office the next day, or that something could come in between, which is why you have to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither the colleagues nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Summaries, checkers, phone calls
One is just deepened in his work, but is suddenly disturbed by the loud whims of the colleagues?
Do you want to hear a phone call that you shouldn’t have heard?
You should not bother your colleagues with buzzing, singing, loud conversations (which you carry across their heads), trampling, constantly shrieking or grumbling.
All of this can be very disturbing, even if they are not exactly immersed in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Are the others always to blame?
If a project is not finished on time, one has forgotten to send an important letter or important messages, one should not seek the guilt of one’s own oblivion with others!
If possible, do not talk about the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
It is best to admit your mistakes and apologize if others were affected.
The question of how to make up for the mistake again, or how to make up for the failure, is all too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like at home?
Training pants and sleeping: comfortable for home, but hasn’t lost anything in the office!
Not even then should you dress so casually if it would actually allow the workplace!
Just don't get too sloppy - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself to the extent that you dress appropriately in the office - if desired, also pretty and elegant!
Everyone wants to do it right – or how to become uninteresting to others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning traffic jam.
From the radio sounds a strange melody: the sound of a violin, paired with electronic effects.
I turn the volume higher.
The tempo changes, to the previous sounds comes the bass, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It is the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar that sounds on mr2.
For a long time, the local music scene has not exactly spoiled us with qualitative electropop.
But now you can even see the jam differently when you hear Zagar’s new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so many new and exciting productions from the domestic digital underground scene slowly contribute to a change in the overall picture, and even when the garage skirt with its guitar whistle is back in, the domestic electropop proves: there is something new under the sun.
Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger started out in Pécs, playing in the band Yonderboi himself, before he - perhaps because a tavern does not tolerate two pipes - began to walk his own way.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, the elements of jazz, electronic, and pop merged, but he only succeeded when he had approached him with the request to compose the soundtrack for a film (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Török).
The formation, which had initially appeared in smaller clubs, only became known to the wider audience when the magazine "wan2" ranked its first album from 2002 among the top 50 domestic albums and named Zagar, along with Yonderboi, the almost only trend set in the West.
Without a doubt, Zagar and his band were "trendy", but no one was interested in whether they would like to wear this brand.
The band has responded as it should: with a new, even better album.
The now released new album titled "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open up new paths for them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécs years.
The expression comes from the time when Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger was still travelling with another band.
The airy, flying allusion would also be fine, but besides the ethereal character of the music, the louder guitar, which corresponds to the zeitgeist and the trends, shows the influences of the Rock'n'Roll.
With these songs, singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", introduced himself at the premiere in Millenis.
A song from the album has even made it to the radio hit - the mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi, who has been broadcasting pop music from early to late, has gradually set the earworm to the listeners with the song "Wings of Love", which was recorded with the participation of six domestic singers ("Underground Divas").
All is well (?).
The hvg.hu asked at Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger: The term "layer music" doesn't mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be shallow and meaningless, but they can also be produced only for the sale, which makes them commercial music.
A good pop number can also arise from an honest motive.
The willingness of the listener to record works also according to this principle, regardless of languages and national boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audiences towards your music?
Zs.: Pop music has a greater tradition abroad, especially to the west of us.
There not only teenagers or twens go to concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that happen around them much more attentively, because they also consider them part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Is it important who, where, how many listen to your music?
Zs.: Of course, it is a good feeling to see that more and more come to our concerts.
But we never composed for the market.
With us, music does not arise to serve a purpose, but for a certain reason.
The role of the audience is usually noticeable at the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but there is in turn only in the immutable changes of the moment.
Still, one thing I noticed: If you want to do it all right, you’re no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far would you like to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is a soloist and has built his career in the West.
Zs.: We don’t really go his way, except for trying to interpret this into our music over and over again.
We see ourselves as team players who trust the musical presence of others and let them unfold.
At first, of course, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, as several of us came from his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi, "Wings of Love" is first.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening deliberately staged with a somewhat more popular style towards a wider audience?
Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit, which should then be held as a tow horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was intended as the finale of the album, with which we wanted to dissolve the sound orgy and the somewhat more difficult themes.
Hvg.hu: How did you choose the six female singers?
Why, exactly, what was the guiding principle?
Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea to compose the choir from gifted soloists of the domestic music scene.
This is how the six-headed choir was created - that is, Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik<0xC5><0x91> Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then baptized later "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Did you want to have the song the same way, or did the girls design it?
Zs.: The song had been in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material for the album was ready, we thought that this song still "needs something".
The chord sequence has formally demanded a vocal voice.
I sang the melody the same night, later they learned the girls.
It all came practically at once and was startlingly spontaneous.
I remember being quite electrified at the time, but it was already needed by the "Divas".
With my voice alone, the song would never have been so strong.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert one had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo part (apart from the short solo by Judy Jay), they have no role of their own, sing perfectly together and are no louder than the music, so their singing is not only accompanied by the music.
They were also on the stage at the back.
Is it intentional?
B.Zs.: That they were standing behind was because of purely technical problems.
However, we deliberately did not want to give them solo roles.
The number is also about forgetting your ego a little bit, forgetting who has come from where and where on the road, we simply allow ourselves to be lifted by these particular wings, the wings of love.
I would like others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song came into being.
Hvg.hu: What was the most elaborate song?
Zs.: Nothing at all in the musical creation work, there have been more difficult tasks when mixing.
For example, in "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", in which I play on a concert piano, or in "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the groove didn't want to work anymore, but gradually everything merged, as with a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song from the new album?
Zs.: This changes with the concerts on a regular basis and also now that I have "leave" the album.
“Prophet is a Fool,” “Escape from the Earth,” and “Never the Same.”
Fraudulent broker risked billions due to feelings of inferiority
Unlawful fraudsters
For example, his former employee Jerome Kerviel of the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komer<0xC4><0x8D>n<0xC3><0xAD> banka.
It came in at almost five billion euros.
It seems, however, that Kerviel was only a great player who wanted to do it the same way with his colleagues, and was certainly not incapacitated.
Unlike all major banking houses, he recognized the crisis in the American mortgage market in time.
"He's rather weak mentally," was heard from the mouth of his superiors, who showed him to the police.
However, as it appears from Kerviels’ statements published by the French media, such as the daily newspaper Le Monde, he was a person who had made profits of 1.6 billion euros at the end of last year with his business.
Crisis not just in America
“All I wanted was to make money for my bank,” he claims in his statement.
In the summer, he managed to make half a billion euros in the American crisis.
He had already seen the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, there was already first news that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as those given to low-income customers or those who had previously had payment problems, would be in trouble.
However, this crisis should not have an impact on the entire economy.
Kerman did not believe it and was right.
By the end of the year, he had increased his profit to 1.6 billion euros.
“Even when I had earned the first half billion, I didn’t know how to explain it,” Ker admits, and goes on to say that he definitely didn’t keep anything for himself.
During the whole interrogation, he admits that he faked documents so that you wouldn’t get on with him.
He even managed to keep his bosses out of the light, even though the Eurex exchange was gradually interested in his business.
Risk profit
Was he afraid to fly?
Hardly.
"I thought she was satisfied with the simple fact that I earned $1.6 billion for the bank."
Where did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to gradually develop his position.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years he was already an assistant to a broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
He knew he would never earn as much as others.
"Even at my first interview in 2005, I knew I was being watched.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel explained to the investigating officer.
But soon after his entry came the first great success.
With the shares of the Alliance, he earned a lot by putting half a billion euros in the price losses of this title in the London bombings.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you make a profit, we'll let you
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But the bosses supposedly knew everything, or knew it.
“As long as I made money, they closed their eyes.”
But then came the big blow at the beginning of this year.
In a single day, he lost one billion euros.
On a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to make up for it.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros because of it.
And how did they get to him?
He was suspicious of a vacation.
“I only took four days from last year.
A broker who doesn’t take a vacation is one who doesn’t want you to look at him in the cards,” Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has a chance to reach 365 billion
Yesterday, Czech Ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes, which will enable the Czech Republic to reach €14 billion in the coming years (around 365 billion kroner).
This is about half of the total that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels in 2007-2013.
About 125 billion kroner comes from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive about 100 billion kroner from the "Company and Innovation" programme.
Most of the money, about 150 billion, will flow into traffic expansion.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and comprises up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the fund.
This money will increase according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have over 90.8 billion next year.
The company and innovation programme is designed to help entrepreneurs and companies to raise funds for innovative businesses.
As a result, the companies will gain funding for the introduction of new technologies, for corporate research, but also for the introduction of more effective organizational methods.
In the past money acquisition from EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the least successful among the new accession countries to date.
Nicaraguan court confirms 20-year prison sentence for ex-presidents
An appeals court in Nicaragua on Thursday confirmed the 20-year prison sentence for former President Arnold Aleman, to which he had been sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud of $100 million (nearly 1.8 billion kroner).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his hazienda near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state is back behind bars is currently unclear, according to the AP news agency.
According to the court of appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the prison officials, whether to let Aleman sit his sentence at home, or whether he has to go to jail.
A court found four years ago that Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n had regularly shifted money from the government to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money eventually landed in a fund set up by Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n to fund his campaign in 2001.
Budget is through
Yeah, it's done.
The state budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget designed by this government and adopted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
The current year was approved with the support of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD (Social Democrats) because Minister Sobotka (of that party) had presented him, and the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could not therefore allow itself to reject him.
Unlike the lively debate before the vote on the motion of censure against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Representatives approved this traditionally little-observed, yet highly significant law in peace.
This is, to a certain extent, paradoxical.
All government begins and ends with the individual chapters and posts of the household, whether one likes it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but is obscured by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more appreciative topic for the media, and that is why they pay more attention to it.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting to the public than sober numbers.
In the past social democratic governments, state budgets suffered from three weaknesses that the 2008 budget cannot eliminate at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure that is required by law, not only pensions, but also social expenditures that the "silent" coalition of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M (communists) decided in the last year before the elections.
The second is deficit fiscal policy as a result of the first weak point.
The third limitation is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
However, the biggest risk is not the government budget deficit.
This budget is public and somewhat under control.
A real time bomb, however, is the budget deficit of the municipalities.
Many mayors, apart from income from taxes, levies, and bank loans, issued additional sources of investment, often unconsidered debt securities by which they over-indebted their town halls.
In recent years, they have been able to pay off these debts by massively selling shares of the energy and other utilities they had received from the state in the course of privatization.
Now this source is already gone.
To the extent that we only adhere to official and verifiable facts, we find that:
Our economy has been going through a phase of growth for a number of years, like the rest of the world, which the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD boasts of without ceasing.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, however, these governments owed the state even more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have done much more rationally than our Republic.
This is a huge shame that is mainly attributable to the previous governments.
We are among the countries that, seen on a global scale, are least at risk of poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes, which unfortunately have been inflated to a gigantic extent in recent years.
Although some of the absurd populist expenditures that were passed this year before the elections have succeeded, it is clear that if there is not a shift in retirement age and a pension reform in the near future, then virtually any policy in this country ends, and no matter who is in power, nothing will be left to him but pure management.
It is only slightly exaggerated when it is said that then from ruling politicians become officials who mechanically divide most of the tax revenue into pensions and social expenditures.
Therefore, this year’s budget cannot be a revolution, but can only stop the displacement of normal expenditure by compulsory expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion kroner foreseen for 2008 would be quite superfluous if previous governments had not spent in the last ten years, which was just what was going on.
If we don’t want it to really happen that ruling politicians become pure administrative officials, then we need to be patient and this not too strong coalition government, which is aware, however, that the state can only spend as much as it can on taxes and fees, is able to wish for rest in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these allow a gradual enforcement of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to deal with the crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial markets.
For example, more than $100 billion will go to the currency markets through auctions.
At these auctions, banks auction interest rates to which they are willing to lend each other money.
For example, the U.S. Fed sends $40 billion to auction, another 24 makes it easy for the European and Swiss central banks.
It is the first time after the September 11 attacks that the central banks of the individual states have agreed on such a coordinated approach to countering or mitigating the consequences of a financial crisis.
“This step is intended to eliminate the greatest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the increasing lack of freely available capital that banks can lend,” wrote Bernard Baumohl, a client of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group.
“The coordinated action of central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the U.S. from 65% to about 50%,” Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to unserviced loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further billions of losses.
“The central banks really must have been afraid of what could still be done when they decided to do so,” said ABN Amro’s chief economist, Kieran Davies.
“It looks like the situation is really bad,” he continued.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficult access to bonds, loans will also become more expensive for their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the American economy into a recession, possibly affecting economic growth around the world.
Central banks have decided to lower the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank interest rate used in lending money between banks.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to borrow money from each other, even though the central banks of the US, Canada and the UK had lowered their interest rates several times during the fall.
“This will have the same effect as a further reduction in interest rates,” said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting, Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this move by central banks contributes to warming up the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the case of the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: Ecologist Debates Are Unbelievable
Global climate change is said to hurt developing countries the most.
President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus spoke again on the issue of global warming.
The criticism now referred to the UN’s final international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A Blue, Not a Green Planet", he explained that the debates of ecologists are incredulous.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which constitutes a strange mixture of government representatives and those of non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a word-firework that is only a substitute for a real solution to current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech president stressed at the presentation of his book that his topic was very important to him, and that he is therefore committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appeared in German translation because "I often meet on cartoons of my views."
Now, interested parties could read his attitude in an undisturbed manner.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climatologist, but in his opinion he had sufficient conditions to write such a book.
After all, he is an academic, capable of understanding and assessing professional treatises, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
As the main statement of the book, he described the thesis that the climate is constantly changing, and that its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consistent opinion among scientists on global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and serious, and thus do not pose a threat, and that the efforts to influence the development of the climate are superfluous, ineffective and unacceptable.
Moreover, as someone who has experience with totalitarian systems, he considers it unacceptable to impose other unproven views, he sees this as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
On questions from those present, he repeatedly stated that he was not against “a reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who do not take into account the relationship between effort and yield.”
Klaus had already spoken about the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600000 people failed to exchange their driver's license
600000 drivers missed the deadline to exchange their old driver’s license, the validity of which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day to apply for an exchange so that the authorities can issue a new driver’s license by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after New Year, hundreds of thousands of drivers will go on the streets without valid driving permission.
According to the authorities, mainly those who do not want to change their driving license have not changed their driving license.
While small towns report a sharp decline in interest in the exchange of tickets, the capital’s offices are filled with requests, and the interest in exchange grew this week.
The city administration processes around 2,000 customers every day.
You have to wait about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driver’s license.
The exhibition of a new driver's license takes 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shortened period of five days.
In this case, the driver must pay 500 kroner.
Drivers who do not create the required exchange until the end of the year and leave without a valid driver’s license are facing a fine from January.
The offender pays a maximum of 2000 kroner.
However, the police can also have it used with a warning in the case of the violation.
In the event of a violation, the penalty can rise to 2500 kroner.
According to previous information, even the one who is imposed by the municipality can get a penalty that does not drive at all.
He could, it was said, face a penalty of even 30,000 crowns.
The ministry has already called on the offices to let mildness prevail and to impose a maximum penalty of 1000 kroner.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one is facing a thousand-dollar penalty.
The driver’s license is a document in which everyone can decide whether they want to own it or not.
It is not a passport that everyone, and that is a valid passport, must have.
People who don’t want to drive should give their driving license.
It is enough to take him to the competent municipal office or to send him there by registered mail.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 become invalid.
However, drivers will gradually have to exchange other types of driving licenses.
People with driving licenses from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to exchange.
The validity of driving licences issued between 2001 and 2004 will end in December 2013.
According to Hanselka, this is about 2.6 million more driving licenses.
Court lowers penalties for detectives allied with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k, who are accused of doing business with the gang of David Berdych, were given 13 or 10 years in prison.
This was decided by a court of law in Prague, which reduced its sentence by one or two years.
Initially, the detectives of the "Office for the Fight Against Organized Crime" threatened 14 or 12 years respectively.
There is no appeal against today's ruling, only revision to the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also charged in this matter, but first the first sentence is before him.
In other cases, however, he had already received penalties of a total of 16 years.
He cannot be condemned for more.
In January, a district court convicted 19 people mainly for involvement in robberies, the Oberlandesgericht today negotiated the appeal of 16 of them.
Most defendants denied the charge from the start on the grounds that it was a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, in consultation with Berdych criminals, members of the police handed over information from sources of the police, covered various robberies and helped members of the gang to escape prosecution.
The gang gave Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k 30 percent of the loot.
The charge concerns crimes committed by the gang from 1999 to 2001.
Especially in the case of robberies, whose victims often suffered serious injuries, but also in the case of official orders and illegal possession of weapons.
During house searches, the police discovered illegal guns, ammunition with steel core, a laser target telescope and a machine gun.
The gang, according to the indictment, has enriched itself by many millions of crowns due to their robberies.
In addition to nearly 20 men in this trial, Berdych and a number of others were legally convicted of further robberies.
Other men from Berdych's circle have to answer in another trial, other cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The main hearing has so far been Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC5><0xAF>ta and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who are in Irish custody waiting for the final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic.
Children exchanged - bill: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a maternity clinic, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, wants to demand compensation from the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> 12 million kroner plus court costs.
For each of the mothers three million, for the fathers two million and for the children one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent couple.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l, therefore does not agree with the Velebas proposal at all.
"We reject such a proposal, it's a lot too high," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l said after today's hearing.
"But in order to form an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need the opinion that the other side had created.
We will see if it has any significance at all.
However, we insist on the view that this should be in the hundreds of thousands of areas for everyone,” Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l stressed.
According to him, the amount should move between 100000 and 200000 crowns for each of the four parents.
In the beginning, the family from Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov wanted a million crowns for every month that she had not raised her biological daughter.
For Veleba, the basis for compensation negotiations was an opinion that he had prepared for the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
According to psychologists and psychiatrists, the children’s parents suffered psychological damage and stress symptoms in varying degrees of strength and depth.
The men were better off with the stress situation, even if they saw themselves facing accusations that they could have prevented the confusion of the newborns.
The women, in turn, cope worse with the aftermath of the trauma experienced, as well as with what is happening now, Veleba summarized the content.
Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses from the maternity clinic in T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> on 9 December last year.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the <0xC4><0x8C>erm<0xC3><0xA1>ks in P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanov<0xC3><0xA1> to Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov.
At the end of October, the Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina District Chief (Böhmisch-M<0xC3><0xA4>hrische Höhe) handed over 100000 crowns to each family as a substitute for expenses incurred by the T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> hospital, which is the county's head.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured for liability.
In case of doubt, they must resort to a reserve fund, only exceptionally can they apply for assistance from the carrier.
The courts have so far awarded victims comparatively low damages, the amounts were determined by tables and moved in the range of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka came to his kingdom Walachei
Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost the dispute over the brand "Kingdom Walachei".
According to the judge at the district court in Ostrava, he was the first to use the name "Walachian king", but the project had built up a team around Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> in cooperation with the actor for many years.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka did not participate in the trial today.
According to his lawyer, however, the matter is probably not finished and his client will probably appeal.
"The dispute is about Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team wanting to participate in the popularity of Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's parasitic," said Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's lawyer after the hearing.
Everyone introduced themselves to this actor and comedian in the words "Walachian Kingdom".
The same is true of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
“We have almost ten years of work behind us.
Money raising and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the occasion is a dispute over money.
“After years, they noticed that the project was successful and that they could have some of it.
They want to win parasiticly at our work," he said.
Lukrative business
According to the court, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka used the name "Walachian King" for the first time in one of his television shows.
In 1993, actor Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD> crowned him.
But that was not at the time with the intention of establishing a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of issuing Welsh passports.
A business and an entrepreneurial activity emerged from an original fun action, to which Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> then joined the founding of the company "Walachian Kingdom".
In 1997, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka agreed to the use of his name and signature in the passports and even offered discounts to their owners when visiting his farm and theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also stated today that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> only used the mere idea that Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka had made public in the show "Manege" for his entrepreneurial intentions.
"The popularity of Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vkas has certainly helped the project of the Wallachian Kingdom," the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team were those who had devoted themselves intensively to him.
The co-operation of the parties that are now divided lasted until the year 2000, when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized the official coronation for Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka in Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n.
Since then, however, the disputes between Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> began to pile up, culminating in the deposition of "King Boleslav I elected until the Saint-Nimmerleins Day".
Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>s Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>ul<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> then took up the leadership role as Queen Mother at the suggestion of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>s Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>ul<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1>.
In 2002, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka filed a lawsuit against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his company, which the court rejected today.
Clarity in the dispute could bring the competition prepared by Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> for the throne and half a princess.
This is what a new king should come out of.
He didn’t want to reveal details and an appointment.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It should be something like the royal move in the Walachei.
The king should be elected for a certain period of time.
Mr Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka can also sign up quietly," added Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Disappearing parts
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not worth much, the quality of the gearshift, steering and also the processing could be described as rather under-average.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and it is much better.
The combination called SW is still a bit further, and I just have to revise my opinion.
When I tested the classic 207 hatchback, for example, I had to complain about the lack of headroom on the rear seats.
These complaints no longer exist, because the body of the combi is designed in such a way that not even two-meter men will suffer.
Fast forward
I only go through the interiors for a short time, so as not to repeat myself too much.
It is a pretty successful design, where I have only objections because of the gloomy middle tunnel.
There I would welcome a little more designer design, where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and past are the times when we might complain about too short seats or head restraints.
The lateral support has also improved significantly compared to the 206.
As far as space is concerned, you can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the body.
In the combination, the already mentioned lack of headroom is also eliminated.
Suitcases in the trunk
But the main thing about this car is the cargo compartment.
I have to call this (also because of the foldable back window) very well chargeable and space-saving.
The cavities are equipped with retaining straps that represent an ideal compromise.
They do not disturb, can be pulled apart and also hold heavier objects.
But let’s talk about the loading volume.
According to the table in the basic equipment, it is 428 liters, which is a rather average value compared to the competition.
However, not compared to the best-selling car of this class in the Czech Republic, the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi.
When we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot is left behind by clearly noticeable 52 liters.
This value is already critical for a foreign holiday or when inviting a stroller.
But to highlight the positives, I still have to mention the loading space, which is very flat after the folding of the rear seats, or the very low loading edge.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with a displacement of 1.6 liters and a power of 88 kWp.
And honestly, that’s how a 1600 cubic engine should look that drives a family-hatchback.
It is quiet, has a low consumption and pulls well away.
If I compare him to his counterpart at <0xC5><0xA0>koda, who sometimes seems like his exhaust jammed with a rag, then I can only be enthusiastic about him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not very popular.
However, we must remember that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400s petrol engine in the amount of 329900 kroner is still pending.
With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns, which is already quite a lot.
The premium equipment of the test car beats again with 80000 crowns in addition to beech.
However, we had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wiper release, electric window lifters at the back and...
For example, the car costs a total of 531900 crowns.
That’s a lot, but count the extras of a Fabia and you’ll arrive at a very similar amount.
Only then will you decide which brand you want to choose.
The integration of Slovak students in British schools is not possible.
In British schools, the number of children from countries in Eastern Europe is increasing, which causes local fears about the further development of the local school system.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has so far encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools even note cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools illustrates a striking case of North Kent, where disputes between locals and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Disputes, harassment and predatory behavior among students have been transferred to the relationships between the parents.
The situation has already developed to such an extent that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The accused defended himself with the boy insulting her with racist insults.
Police also had to intervene after an attack on a Slovak immigrant by two underage girls.
The girls had allegedly made racist remarks to the man and threw him with stones.
“When we went home, a boy climbed on a bush noise and spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw us apples and pears and then exposed his buttocks," a mother of Slovak students from The Times newspaper described another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even described the dispute with the immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cited cases testify that the mood between locals and immigrants at British schools is becoming increasingly tense.
In the UK, 70000 Slovaks have been reported who came here looking for work.
Some 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, it will come true if you just choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palms and All Inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and beguiling cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this to a large extent.
Only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place a human eye has ever seen.
Havana once became a camp or transit camp of treasures that the Spaniards had robbed in America and then transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built at the end of the 20th century.
It was built by one of the chiefs of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the United States (especially during the Prohibition) was liked and supported in Cuba – drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were among others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
High-rise buildings grew in Havana, across the wide boulevards, driving cars that were among the iconic symbols of the fifties of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Coj<0xC3><0xAD>mar he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars of the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar at the Hotel Nacional you can mix cocktails as desired.
And the cult cars of the fifties continue to travel around in Havana to this day, because the once imported shigulis and fiats have long since fallen apart in the salty and humid air.
May Havana, especially its oldest part, have come down heavily, nowhere in the vicinity can you find as many wonderful colonial sights as right here.
Other places are being cleaned out, such as Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism brings much-needed money, there was a green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have emerged not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holgu<0xC3><0xAD>n and also on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a marotte that is unique in the world and especially attracts railway lovers.
The sugar cane from remote plantations brought steam- and diesel-powered narrow-gauge tracks to the sugar factories.
Their fleet has not been renewed for decades, and this is where you can see clean and fully functioning locomotives, whose peers have long been in the museum elsewhere.
Excursion destinations
The most important places do not make up the majority of visitors to Cuba.
You don’t have to write about Varadero or Havana in detail anymore.
It remains to be mentioned that Hemingway’s already mentioned estate houses a museum whose visit to the one who likes this writer should not be missed.
The Vi<0xC3><0xB1>ales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on limestone floor.
The mogotas, limestone hills and rocks, rise steeply from the valley floor, and in their hollow spaces, fertile soil accumulates, through which also weathered rock areas are covered by dense vegetation.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet him when you visit one of Havana’s cigar factories.
It may also seem interesting that the Chilean episode of the television series "Major Zeman" was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
Fame and wealth brought her the trade of slaves and sugar.
The wealth was embodied in the beautiful beauty of the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is such a remote place that there was no road there in the 1950s of the last century that would have connected the area to the rest of the country.
This isolation contributed to the fact that it remained unnoticed.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was torn down, everyone was glad that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than an afternoon for Trinidad, it is worth seeing interesting places in the area, such as the beach Playa Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n or the "Valley of Sugar Factories".
In the evening you should then go to the Casa de la M<0xC3><0xBA>sica, which revives after the darkness, and where the music does not remain until the morning.
Baracoa
This small town in the east of Cuba is known by some as the most beautiful of the island.
Surely this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both roads leading from Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo have to overcome high and rugged mountains and run through a landscape that is barely touched by human intervention.
Thanks to its unspoilt nature, UNESCO has added this eastern outpost of Cuba to its World Heritage List.
There the best chocolate is made, in the church you show the cross of Columbus (in reality it was created about a hundred years after the trips of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the current Hotel El Castillo, stands, you can see several table mountains, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountains, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana Cabaret, the sanctuary of Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves profess, one could write many pages about all this.
As they say, look better with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans claim.
Too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment affect the course of the mission in Afghanistan, according to the United States.
According to Defense Secretary Robert Gates, NATO should draw up a concrete plan for the next few years.
The mission in Afghanistan did not go according to their ideas, the representatives of the countries in Scotland agreed on this, which have stationed units in the south of the country.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban, the eight participating states also discuss further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, called for more activity on NATO units, Britain sees priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and in intensifying development aid.
“A forward development is noticeable in Afghanistan, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to enable residents to begin their own economic and security development,” said British Defence Minister Des Browne.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents has reached the highest level in five years, according to the American army.
The number of acts of violence has increased by 27 per cent compared to the previous year, and in the southern province of Helmand even by sixty per cent.
NATO countries have deployed about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have reached an absolute limit in terms of the organization and equipment of the units.
Specifically, they are calling for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
“We will have to seriously think about the concrete goals for the next time and about the way we can achieve them,” Gates said.
The Secretary-General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop, said the same thing today.
"I'm not happy with what we have at our disposal in Afghanistan on land and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's too little," De Hoop told Reuters to conclude three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is Passive
In recent months, there has also been a dispute among the participating countries over whether all allies in Afghanistan are doing their best.
For example, Germany was criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fighting demands for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country," Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun this week described the German soldiers as lazy furs.
"Afghan no-doors debunked: the Germans are making games while our boys are fighting," wrote the Sun in a post supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bildzeitung went over to counterattack and printed a picture of a British unit in a rugby competition in southern Afghanistan.
Government debt will rise to a trillion in 2009
There is a national debt of 84,000 kroner on each Czech Republic.
Total debt rose to 842.7 billion kroner by the end of September.
The government had planned to incur debt this year with 159.2 billion cones.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion thanks to the better development of government budgetary policy.
The government debt of the Czech Republic rose to 842.7 billion kroner by the end of September.
Within the first nine months of this year, they increased by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its information on the national debt from the beginning of October.
There is a debt of 84,000 kroner on each Czech Republic.
Over the past year, the state owed more than 111 billion kroner.
"Until now, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we may not exceed the limit of a trillion kroner until 2009.
Next year, the debt should move between 900 billion and a trillion crowns," said David Marek, analyst at Patria Finance, the server iHNed.cz.
Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Pikora, analyst at Next Finance, said: “We could come in 2009 to exceed a trillion.
When exactly, depends on the next budget that we don’t know yet.
If it turns out that the situation on the political stage is changing, and politicians should be willing to save more, it could take up to 2010.
But I don’t expect such a change,” he said.
Debts grow
Government debt stems from the government’s debt and is mainly due to the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
The public debt is financed by tax statements, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, by bonds of the European Investment Bank.
Domestic government debt has risen to 719.4 billion kroner this year.
The foreign debt of the state has now risen by 1.7 billion kroner to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable sovereign debt reached 803.3 billion kroner at the end of September and fell by 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of government debt increased to 6.5 years.
“Over the year, total debt rose by 13 percent from the first to the third quarter, which really is a lot given how well the economy is doing.
It is interesting that the growth is mainly recorded in the bonds where the increase is 20 percent.
It’s bad that the debt is rising, but on the other hand, this shows that you can do something before the pension reform comes,” Pikora said.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the handling of government debt for 2007 shows that the government had planned to raise 159.2 billion kroner for this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion kroner thanks to the better development of the state budget policy.
This amount is mainly due to the government budget deficit, which will obviously reach 76 billion kroner this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
It is also a maximum of 13.3 billion kroner for the consolidation agency, a ten billion reserve to pay pensions, financing sovereign bonds for 43 billion kroner and installments for bonds with the European Investment Bank for 1.8 billion kroner.
For giving a name to a teddy bear, she was presented today to a court in Khartoum.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, who had been charged with insulting Islam in Sudan, was sentenced by a court in Khartoum on Thursday evening to 15 days in prison and subsequent expulsion.
The British were accused of allowing six to seven-year-old students to name a teddy bear Mahomet, although any depiction of the Islamic Prophet is prohibited.
She deserved to be whipped.
After parents of students complained to the Sudanese Ministry of Culture several times, the 54-year-old elementary school teacher, who worked at Khartoum’s Unity High School, was taken to his home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam under Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code.
In fact, this matter begins in September, when the teacher asks her six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class teddy.
The children suggest eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reports head of school Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 of 23 children choose Mohammed as their favorite given name.
Certainly, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Afterwards, the children created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the caption My name is Mohammed.
The bear itself did not bear a sign with that name, but the problem is quite simple that the depiction of the Islamic prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said he knows her well, and she would never have done anything that would have made her too close to a religious faith, I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name, in his opinion this is just an innocent mistake.
An opinion that many students of the teacher share, describing it as very attentive to their students and as a person who never talks about religion in class.
Remember that the first name Mohammed is also the second most common given in the UK, for which there are 14 different spellings in English.
This name, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered a kind of homage to the Prophet (he is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Can you give him a toy, for example?
This, of course, is a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday, there was no agreement at the last meeting in Vienna on the future status of the province.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo ended a sixth and final discussion session in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without being able to overcome their controversy over the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not reach an agreement on the status, said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasising that peace in the region is at stake, its American counterpart Frank Wilsner called on Belgrade and Pristina to fulfil their commitments to maintain peace and continue the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
No acts of violence are expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added, suggesting that there are quite clear tensions.
End of mediations on 10 December
The Troika mediators, which unites the European Union, the United States and Russia, will meet in Serbia and Kosovo on Monday for the last time.
The future of the 90% of Albanian-speaking province could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The talks of Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and final negotiating session since the Troika had been commissioned by the UN last August to conduct a new mediation.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation mission to end on December 10.
The Russians, who had already blocked Kosovo’s approval of independence from the Security Council, insisted on continuing the negotiations beyond this deadline.
Russia was and remains the advocate of a negotiated solution, a consensual solution, Botsane-Khartchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After Kosovo has been under the administration of the UN for eight years, the Western countries consider independence under the supervision of the EU to be the only solution with a future.
Pristina is ready to announce it unilaterally if the Security Council should not decide in their favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached, the president of Kosovo’s autonomous authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the hotel in Baden, where since Monday these negotiations were held the last chance.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, shared his regrets.
However, he added that the Belgrade-proposed plan is part of the autonomy of a past that has led to murders and deportations.
Domino effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, felt that a compromise should always be sought and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade believes that it is particularly responsible for a "domino effect" in a region that is so weakened by the independence wars of the 1990s.
For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision should be taken solely in the Security Council, where its Russian ally holds a veto right.
Kosovo's parliament will have the last word
Only one decision from the ranks of the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
These negotiations took two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council.
Fatmir Sejdiu told reporters that Kosovo’s parliament would have the final say in terms of status, adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking population would expire in coordination with the Western countries.
Bush Uncovers Israeli-Palestinian Agreement
At the opening of the international peace conference, which had gathered under his leadership in Annapolis, Maryland, on Tuesday, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He further stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do anything to help them conclude a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must destroy the terrorist infrastructures and Israel must stop its colonization efforts, Bush said, reminding the two parties of their commitments to the roadmap for peace that they had agreed to in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority under Abbas ultimately seek a peace treaty to resolve all open issues without exception, and including the central issues.
This designation includes the three serious problems that the disputes between Israelis and Palestinians revolve mainly around: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees displaced from their homelands in the course of the 1948 conflict that lies in today’s state of Israel.
According to the American president, Abbas took the floor and insisted that the upcoming negotiations be conducted comprehensively and thoroughly and provide a settlement for all points, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
When Olmert took the floor, he pledged that the upcoming cease-fire negotiations would be conducted directly and without interruption and that he would make an effort to bring them to an end before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for implementing his vision of two states, one Palestinian and one Israeli that stand side by side, for the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has disclosed that it has received assurances from Bush in this sense from Bush before it decided to attend the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has launched a plan adopted by all Arab countries that offers peace to Israel, in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central points of view, the Saudi Arabian Prince says in his interview with the Saudi-funded Arabic-language daily newspaper.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this type of local news, official versions and rumors are facing each other.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation of the National Disciplinary Authority of the Police (IGPN), on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., a police car on Rue Louise-Michel headed for Villiers-le-Bel.
He had no effort, but was on the strip, and drove at 40-50 km/h, without blue light, a police spokesman said.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, without approval, so not released for public road traffic (see below), arrived, controlled by two young people without a helmet, at a very high speed.
It rammed the left side of the police car after it had disregarded its progress from the right, a policeman further explained.
The alcohol control carried out by the vehicle passengers is very negative.
The condition of the car (contaminated fender, split windshield, torn bumper) testifies to the severity of the impact.
Very quickly, as early as yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se de Givry, announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an investigation into the "facts of involuntary murder of persons and the lack of assistance to persons in danger", in coordination with the main area management for public safety of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the prosecutor stated that she excludes the accountability of the police officers at this stage of the investigation of the IGPN.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident heard on Sunday night have confirmed the version of the police officers, namely that this small-power wheel has come to their left relatively quickly.
Yesterday showed a kind of groove, certainly caused by the friction of the footrests on the ground, that the two vehicles had remained hooked together until the police managed to brake.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical review.
The bodies of the two victims were obdurate yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday in Villiers-le-Bel quickly made a rumor that the police had left the scene of the accident very quickly, and that without helping the two youths.
Although the IGPN remains quite cautious, it would also rule out this matter regarding any serious errors.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigation that requires further investigation and which requires very careful action.
Libération met an eyewitness shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had a direct view of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her, this witness tells us.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely disturbed police officer hanging.
Two more tried to revive one of the youths, the fourth phoned.
Given the tension that had quickly formed around the incident and, as it seems, due to the certainty that the people present had about the unexpected situation of the young people, the police officers were taken into the car by colleagues who had arrived at the scene of the accident.
Still according to this testimony, the rescuers arrived about twenty minutes after the policemen left.
They have also used heart massages, but in vain.
I will not allow it to be claimed that the police forces had not provided any help to the young people.
First aid was given to these young people.
The fire department arrived immediately.
Everything was done to try to save them, the prosecutor stressed.
In Pakistan, tensions are rising
On Monday, the Pakistani police broke down the first demonstrations since General Musharraf declared the state of emergency two days earlier.
According to witnesses, in the city of Lahore in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who demonstrated against the measures taken in the context of the emergency were injured by the tear gas grenades used by the law enforcement forces there.
They then threw stones at the police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been arrested temporarily.
Similar scenarios existed in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers attacked and injured lawyers.
Several had been arrested temporarily.
In Islamabad, the attorneys of the Supreme Court have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests by opposition activists, human rights advocates and lawyers during the weekend.
On Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (northeast).
On Monday, the attorneys’ movement received the support of the religious parties united in the powerful alliance of Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president urged the population to send flowers to judges who opposed the state of emergency and to those who took an oath before Musharraf.
Musharraf's promise no longer applies
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced Saturday evening.
In the following days, he had to take a position on the legality of President Musharraf’s re-election in a direct ballot on October 6.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from office and replaced.
All that we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional, and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court, the Magistrate of the newspaper The News said.
Pervez Musharraf’s promise to surrender command of the army and become a civilian president no longer applies since the emergency call, the deputy minister of information Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
It was expected that he would release his military uniform by November 15, the date on which his first term as president ends.
The Deputy Minister for Information has also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government denied the persistent rumours in the country that President Musharraf had been assigned a place of residence by his deputy commander.
More than a third of pregnancies are still not planned
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth law that allowed contraception in France, one in three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, as a study by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the different methods of contraception such as the pill or the spiral still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the institute, which notes that the percentage of pill users between the ages of 20 and 40 who use the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, however, the liberalisation of contraception has enabled better control of fertility.
In any case, eight out of ten births are carefully planned today.
With one in five couples even calculated exactly on the month, and, if possible, in spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) will have taken more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector, which is indispensable for the continuation of scientific work on the station.
A daring exit that, due to its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools mastered by the astronauts to perform the repair, has achieved several records.
The problem occurred on Wednesday, when the astronauts had unloaded the Harmony module from the Discovery spacecraft, a large cylindrical part that will soon take up the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module laboratory.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to implement a 17.5-ton module for power generation via solar panels, which was already on the ISS, in order to bring it into its final position.
After moving it, the crew restructured the solar panels of the module, the span of which was 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors, which can be folded up like accordions, was damaged by a clamped cable over a length of about one meter.
The restructuring was stopped in order not to damage the collector any more.
The astronauts, who were originally supposed to leave the Discovery spacecraft for a control flight and then repair another solar collector whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around at the end of the 30-metre-long remote-controlled arm of the space shuttle that had been attached to the station to perform the repair.
He is one of NASA’s best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very skillful, he has a well-developed upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old doctor was therefore chosen to operate the injured solar collector.
After examining the damage closely, he cut through the faulty cable and fixed some kind of rails on the damaged spot.
He was supported by a second spacewalker who stayed near the lock, and, by the other astronauts inside, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey bat, wrapped with insulator to prevent an electric shock on the solar collectors, which produce several hundred volts, had the astronauts on board the station invented and mastered.
When the action ended, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully folded up before counting his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before today seven astronauts returned to the Discovery spacecraft to take the return flight to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS sanctioned on the stock exchange
After the aviation and defence group announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to counteract the A400M’s backlog, EADS is currently showing a significant decline on the Paris Stock Exchange.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to re-examine its 2007 business forecasts, referring to the remnants caused by the slow-moving development of the A400M engine, which delayed the aircraft's maiden flight.
The costs announced in October to offset the delay in the delivery of their military transport aircraft amount to between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than one billion for Airbus, announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
As a result of these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 at the presentation of its quarterly results on Thursday, he added without further detail.
The group also states that the assessment of the new costs is related to the six-month gap.
Recalling that EADS’ business performance fell from 86% in 2006, mainly due to the delay in another program, the very large carrier A380.
Originally, the group had planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French Army for October 2009.
The choice of status quo
On Sunday it will not be exciting in the countdown of the urns: the mass of the Russians will opt for President Putin's party, United Russia.
After a very closed election campaign, she confirms her quest for stability, even authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a message to the public broadcasters, which has already been recorded, but whose content is kept secret.
He does so in his capacity as the top candidate of the United Russia, the pro-Kreml party, for which an overwhelming victory is announced.
Yesterday, the president did not let anything go through when he received the foreign ambassadors, and was content to provide a new point of attack against the Western powers accused of interference—his favorite topic during the election campaign.
We know the price of a true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud.”
From the point of view of the opposition, they have disappeared.
She denounces an election campaign tainted by oppression.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there would never have been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the suppression of the demonstrations last weekend, former chess world champion Garry Kasparovder has been sentenced to five days in prison for unauthorized demonstration, according to his lawyer continues to be banned from visiting.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus
After these parliamentary elections without tension, two much more questions arise:
Who will be Putin’s successor as president?
The official newspaper announced yesterday the date of the first election of the presidential elections, March 2, 2008; the candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third term in a row.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chairman of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful party of the United Russia, which will elect the government and the president?
Whatever it will be, in the parliamentary or presidential elections, the previous power will triumph.
This is tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus, they are not the master of their fate, says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Centre Levada.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of Saint Petersburg goes even further back: bourgeois society has only developed very slowly in this country, which has been Christianized to Europe for five centuries; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
Following the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin has once again attached to the model of a paternalistic state, which was fully accepted by the population, all the more so since this new paternalism followed no terror, but a certain economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians refrain from free play on the personal responsibility that they have briefly demonstrated after the disintegration of the USSR.
Why do you think about it for a long time?
This phenomenon affects all walks of life, including the business world.
And the administrative elite knows how to keep the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian regional leaders) run the United Russia’s local electoral lists.
The new freedoms emerging from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: Why do you think about it for a long time?
Those who are in power are not so bad, why are they replacing them?
A difficult memory
After being treated confidentially for more than 60 years, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are housed at a total length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, could not be seen until now, unless with a humanitarian intent, i.e. individual and name-related, i.e. at the request of a former victim or his relatives.
The eleven states, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed in May 2006 to make them accessible to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this Decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Heikle Information
Historians' access to Bad Arolsen will allow them to conduct research, especially on the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of concentration camps and the health of forced laborers, explains Reto Meistern, head of these archives, which are administered by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were opposed to making these name-related documents available to the public, due to the delicate nature of certain information.
Like, for example, the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some deportation victims.
The inmates of the concentration camps or the detention orders issued by the Gestapo had been assembled after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labour, and possibly to provide them with evidence of their arrest in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Today, more than 300 permanent employees still work on tens of thousands of personal inquiries in Bad Arolsen.
Nevertheless, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
Nothing fundamentally new can be expected in these documents, said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, Head of the Research Center for Antisemitism at the Technical University of Berlin, in 2006.
The EU and India are seeking a free trade agreement in 2008.
At present, trade between India and Europe already reaches €60 billion a year.
The EU is India’s most important trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, stated that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU’s Foreign Ministers had given the European Commission the green light last April to open negotiations with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), with a view to signing free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the European Commission, India is only the ninth trading partner of the EU.
A free trade pact will move the two economic areas enormously forward and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans, Peter Mandelson confirmed.
Mr. Manuel is the first or second market for the ten most commonly exported products from India, the European Commissioner further explained. The European Commission’s Asian and European giants exchange goods worth EUR 47 billion a year and services worth EUR 10 billion, this week Daniéle Smadja, chairman of the European Commission’s New Delhi delegation, explained, and regrets that the mutual trade has not yet reached its potential in India.

The Bank of England takes note of the concern and offers <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion for five weeks
The Bank of England was concerned on Thursday about curbing the current recurring concern about credit conditions, and announced an offer of <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion with a basic interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with an unusual duration.
In order to mitigate the fears that the conditions in the financial market will be particularly harsh at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty about the way in which they should organize their liquidity positions during this time, the bank intends to offer a significant portion of their savings deposits during the maintenance phase, which begins on December 6, in the form of an open-market option.
The bank further explains that on 6 December at 12.15 GMT 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put into circulation, at the basic tax rate and only until 10 January.
This is apparently the first time that BoE has been putting liquids into circulation for five weeks in an open market operation.
This usually happens for a week.
In its Communication, BoE adds that it is prepared to take further measures to obtain the interest rates of the interbank loans, which vary from day to day, with their basic interest rate.
The mid-term interest rate, which varies from day to day, was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has fallen to 6.6%, slightly higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis of the summer, the sums put into circulation by the Bank of England have been coupled with punitive charges that had prevented the banks from taking advantage of them.
According to certain rumours, reinforced by the development of the pound exchange rate as opposed to the euro, many preferred to sign for the sums circulated by the European Central Bank at more favourable interest rates and with safer discretion
UMP and NC refuse to review PS’s proposals on purchasing power
On Thursday, the groups UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which is equivalent to a rejection of the text.
The text produced by a socialist niche (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary group) indicated about ten measures adopted by the National Committee of the PS on Wednesday, the majority of which were 50% for the employment allowance, for the reintroduction of the TIP fleet, for a transport check or for the limitation of rents.
After UMP and NC voted against the review of the articles (180 votes against 115), the session was dissolved after the main discussion, which gave rise to some heavy word changes between majority and opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television contribution on purchasing power.
The leader of PS Jean Marc Ayrault’s MPs announced that his group will present the entirety of its proposals as an amendment to the legislative proposal for the correction of finances that had been reviewed by the Assembly last week.
A new festival is born
As a result of numerous rumours regarding the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who has served, no more and no less, as a model for the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones of C3 said on Bilboard.com.
C3 hosts the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will take place from August 8-10 on a 500 acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The head of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the most prestigious festivals in the world.
In 1989, he took over the leadership of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, attracting around 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has been taking care of the production, licensing concessions and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he has ever been to, says his company and Melvin Benn are working side by side to provide the area with a European-style festival event.
We have chosen Philadelphia as a market and are working diligently with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We conducted negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Regrettably, we have remained stuck in political debates regarding the current administration, continues Charlie Jones.
“Luckily, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are making preparations to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population.”
C3 Presents brought the Lollapalooza Festival back to life in 2005 at the Grand Park Chicago after it joined forces with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002 in the world of festival profiling.
The two events each generated $9.8 million and $11.8 million in gross tax returns in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
“The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, whereas ours is more likely to take place on the urban green spaces,” says Charlie Jones.
“The goal is to merge these two concepts in one way or another, while at the same time giving the impression of a rural festival in the European and an urban in the American way.”
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The community of Vineland, including the mayor, is taking on the burden of this event with pleasure,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but he confirms that "they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and record a festival that hopefully will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the festival’s recording capacity is “very large,” corresponding to about 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations were sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
“Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of viewers,” says Charlie Jones.
His partners of C3, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award of the last Bollboard Touring Award, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
Not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood movies to Montreal if no less than the Terminator opposes it.
These lock tests are among the delegate tasks.
A political "hot mandate" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to negotiate with the governor?
“You have to be careful, because it is the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those you think are the best,” he says.
Run to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the promotion of the cinema there is a top priority at the moment.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all festivals on the West Coast, though that of Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about presenting the films from Quebec, evaluating them and making sure the producers give interviews.
The dark age had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is the stock market ahead of an end-year rally? Disagreement among experts due to the US mortgage crisis
With just under five weeks until the end of the year on the stock exchange, investors are already rubbing their hands with regard to the upcoming final-year rally.
Nevertheless, the experts cannot make any reliable forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that purely statistically, the month of December on the stock exchange is usually associated with a positive market development
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to make forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics, especially if serious tensions determine the current market situation.
Although other experts do not approve such a strong price increase in the last few weeks of the year, they nevertheless note that the exchange rate is determined by the given liquidity of the market and market participants, who invest mainly in pension funds due to the lack of secure equity funds, which is heavily affected by the upward trend towards profitable assets.
According to these experts, the stock market will tend to have a rather lateral price trend influenced by market fluctuations, especially because we cannot yet estimate the extent of the possible decline in the interest rate of the U.S. Federal Reserve, an uncertainty that is mainly due to the increase in crude oil price and the risk of rising inflation rate.
Javier Barrio, chairman of the sales department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a bold time to announce an upcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has lost a value of 4 % since its peak on 8 November of 15,945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could successfully complete the year with nearly 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of the mutual funds and the traditional, each year around this time.
Nevertheless, the expert points out that this year things could develop somewhat differently, mainly because of the end-year rally that is already taking place in the second week of December, and therefore immediately after the bridge day to the day of the Constitution.
According to the analyst, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, an analyst at Bank Inversis, the previous assessments of the market situation are at an almost technical level, which could lead to a deviation from the index values that depended on the impact of the US mortgage market crisis.
The analyst trusts that these are positive.
When selecting the values to drive the Ibex to new heights, the analysts agree.
Solana from Intermoney asserts that this year’s great values are at stake.
Among the value-winners, the expert would include the two major banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the given time.
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha of Bank Inversis assures that the increase will be accompanied by the increase in connection with the banking and industrial sectors.
If the rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
The ACS has been on hold in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will take the same route, the expert said.
With regard to the increased consumption behaviour during the Christmas days, the last half of the year of periodic consumption will determine the market.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are only represented in small numbers on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
Over the past seven years, December has seen only a two-fold decline in price trends.
When the technology bubble burst at the end of 2003, this led the stock exchange out of its crisis and at the same time initiated the last real end-year rally so far.
This year, when the Ibex 35 gained 28.17 percentage points, December showed a price increase of 6.68%.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth profitable year in a row (the Ibex has risen by 8.36% since January) and can also have a final year's rally, will show.
Popular will have its 200 credit institutions open 12 hours a day from Mondays to Fridays.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of its stores.
A total of 200 of them are located in the most economically powerful regions of Spain.
For the institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches represent a major milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutions, as Popular is the first banking group to represent the jump to extend the opening hours of its branches from weekdays to 20.30h and to start on Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h.
The BBVA banking group, which also repeatedly announced the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet made a definitive decision.
The Bank’s ongoing negotiations with the trade unions seem to be aimed at an agreement in which 75% of all branches are closed on Saturdays and open for this on a weekday afternoon, although not for the clientele.
Whether or not other banks join the new initiative that adapts to business opening times will depend on the experience of Popular Bank.
And that’s exactly the intention that the Popular pursues with their project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those stores which, due to their location, can capture the commercial customers of independent, small and medium-sized companies, but also those of large department stores.
The bank wants to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as these are not new, but changed opening hours.
For this purpose, the bank will redesign the premises of the branches that are already in business zones and at the same time align them with the individual customer profile of the different zones.
The expansion of the opening hours is thus combined with a new layout of the stores, which is characterized by a more up-to-date, colourful design.
The responsible bank representative <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera assures that the restructuring does not require major investments, but was accompanied by increased staffing, as a branch no longer needed six, but eight or nine employees.
The branches, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell any financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its concept at nine stores in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, says <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivero.
The offices of Bravo Murillo, O’Donnell and Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a have been selected for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently manages approximately 2,500 offices.
And another 60, who operate under the name Mundocredit, who specialize in immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and public holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax, the BBVA model is not used, as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
We don’t want to compete for our customers, Rivero explains.
With Telefonica, they have provisionally reached an agreement to sell mobile phones with the help of external bank personnel.
Spanish private broadcaster Telecinco doubles its stock market value for the first time and thus overtakes its rival Antena 3.
We made it.
With this sentence, the CEO of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, announced his satisfaction at the close of the IPO. The broadcaster he led had increased its value by twice its rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, dampened his joy: this is exactly what hurts me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had lower losses, he noted.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they have not fallen too deep.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its previous losses to 15.66% this year.
According to Bloomberg, the company’s value now reaches €4,488.88 million, with Mediaset controlling the main share of the capital (52%), and Vocento only holding 13%.
The rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has reported a total loss of 40.5% since January, so its market value is up half by 2,193.46 million.
The market value of other publicly traded communications companies, on the other hand, is increasing; in the case of Sogecable to 3,571 million, in the case of Prisa (editor of the journal Cinco D<0xC3><0xAD>as), to 2,518.53 million and in the case of Vocento to 1,779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be deduced from the fact that it is two similar companies, Vasile said.
The question of the extent to which we can actually act in terms of stock market technology, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at the customer level is still unclear.
A week ago, Telecinco announced its intention to become the first TV channel to receive more than 1,000 million gross profits from advertising revenue, which was assured by Guiseppe Tringali, CEO of Telecinco and Publiespa<0xC3><0xB1>a, the group’s advertising company.
If the project were to be implemented, the channel would increase its advertising revenue by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the stock exchange (up to 734.4 million), while net income from the television business could only show an increase of 0.7% (630.4 million).
The main factor for Telecinco’s better stock market performance is the analysts’ high payout ratio, which the company was able to show up to the present time: in 2006, the company led by Alejandro Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a caused a 100% dividend distribution.
However, Vasile assures that after purchasing 33% of Endemol’s shares, with Mediaset as its parent company, the ratio could still vary, even if it is still too early for an official announcement.
We are committed to the official compromise of paying out at least 50% of the shares, even if we have so far indicated significantly more.
I hope that we can satisfy our shareholders this year, whose stock values we were already able to increase by buying 33% of Endemol shares.
According to analysts, the market is currently experiencing certain loss tendencies.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecinco by 4% for this year and 7% for 2009.
This is the result of a reduction in the expected growth rate, which will fall from 10.5% in 2008 to 8.4% and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This has also reduced Antena 3’s expected profit calculation by 4.5% for 2008 and 7.5% for 2009.
3 options.
1.
Ibersecurities: relies on its high efficiency return and its sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: measures Telecinco (buy) as a result of the multiple incentives and the prospering market to maintain a more advantageous position than Antena 3.
3.
JPMorgan: In view of the similar threats (saturated market and poorer economic climate) recommends that expectations be reset in both cases
Congress agrees to the MIFID directive, which came into force on November 1.
In parallel with the parliamentary drafting, which ended its session today with the Congressional resolution in the Senate on the supplementary/amendment proposals related to the project, the government published the provisions that emerge from the new law, with the intention of allowing the entry into force of both regulations until the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of Congress and Senate members who, in their negotiations and votes, had pursued the goal of establishing the best possible regulation, ensuring the safety of investors and regulating the individual entrepreneurial activities in order to guarantee a generally efficient market situation.
In addition to modernising the financial markets, MIFID, which redefines the Securities Services Regulation, is pursuing an improvement in investor protection, an increase in the control entitlement of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and the promotion of cooperation between the various control authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive enables both specialised companies and natural or legal persons to offer financial advice and also contributes to the creation of new financial services companies (ESIS), the advisory firms that join the investment and brokerage firms of securities.
In addition, it extends the number of financial transaction execution systems, adding to regulated circulation markets the multilateral securities trading systems and the internationalisation systems of trading orders, which would eventually enter into competition with the current economic operators.
The law obliges investment firms to inform the focus of their company profile, the confrontation and the forms of dealing with risks on the market and to register all projects carried out in order to facilitate the CNMV’s control task.
The Economic Commission of Congress subsequently proposed further changes, with the decision that the debt securities issued with titles must now be considered as complex financial resources for the investor due to their high level of risk, has been confirmed by the US mortgage and banking crisis.
In addition, the directive on the legal limitation of the working areas of qualified economists was adopted; 30 years after 1977, the regulation restricting the working areas reserved for economists was adopted.
The Senate, for its part, defined new positions in the financial sector, such as that of the economic mediator who works on foreign accounts, does not need authorization from the CNMV and can offer its services for the commercialization of products and for the acquisition of customers at the same time to several investment companies.
The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (CPI) rose by five tenths in November and now stands at 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess the inflation rate within the European Union provides the average price trend in Spain in November.
Its publication complies with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which seek to compare location and quality with US products by disclosing the data.
The forecast for the indicator can be prepared prematurely by applying the same approach as in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but at the same time using various other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) warned that the indicator, which had been determined prematurely, would serve only as a guide, and therefore would not have to be in line with the final result announced on 14 December.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) will remain at a relatively high level
According to Deputy Head of Government and Economic and Finance Minister Pedro Solbes, the increase in the CPI was a temporary development in November; at the same time, he assured that the price index would remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
Nevertheless, Solbes noted in the halls of the Congress building that even if the current number is not good, Spain’s inflation differential with the other members of the monetary union has remained more or less the same in recent years.
He also stated that there were fewer surprises in November than in the previous month, in which the government did not expect such a high rise.
We expected a value of around 4%, the Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance announced with a view to the forecast published today.
Virgin expects Northern Rock to generate revenues of over 42 billion euros over the next three years
Northern Rock’s assets have fallen by more than half after the bank asked the UK central bank for an emergency loan in mid-September last year due to the crisis, and they now only amount to <0xC2><0xA3>12,000 million (equivalent to €16,800 million).
At that time, the bank’s assets amounted to a record <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 million, a sum that has fallen considerably within two and a half months due to the loss of trust of customers and even despite the government’s 100% guarantee that the money will remain safe until the end of the crisis.
The company Virgin, which would continue the group after the acquisition under the Virgin Money brand name, will have to raise about a quarter of the British banks’ income, which will be made up of the assets there over the next three years, in order to acquire exactly the <0xC2><0xA3>18 billion needed to reach their target of $30 billion.
The group of multimillionaire Richard Branson, known for its eye-catching advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to have <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 (equivalent to around €70 million) annually flowed into advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named the Virgin Group, in which three more companies are involved, as its preferred bidder to run it out of bankruptcy.
The Mayor of Totana Arrested for Suspected Attendance in Urban Corruption
Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the municipality of Murcia, Totano (Partido Popular), due to the urgent suspicion of involvement in urban corruption that was uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo represented last May the office of Juan Morales, currently a member of the Partido Popular and at the time chairman of the Totana Municipal Council, and may, according to information from the radio station Cadena SER, be the original wire-driver of the plot.
Officials continue to search the business records of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not rule out further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales was accused of the main suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered earlier this week.
According to the Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular, and consequently privileged MP Juan Morales, was arrested while leaving his client's residence due to important burdensome documents to be associated with the plot.
In addition, other sources of information from Morales' alleged order payments report to a Galician construction company, which envisaged the conclusion of an urban construction contract, in which the construction of a 200 hectare area was decided.
Eight people are currently in custody.
Bono agrees to accept the candidacy of the PSOE in Toledo and, in the event of an election victory, in Congress.
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who will thus lead the list of PSOE candidates in the upcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of an election victory of the Socialists, take over the office of the President of Congress.
José Blanco, PSOE’s organizing secretary, and Bono, announced in the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero took place today at the party’s headquarters.
According to the head of government, the offer to the former minister is justified, as it is important in politics to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
In addition, in the event of a victory for the Socialists in the upcoming elections, the Mancha politician would appear to be running for the party as chairman of Congress.
Bono would replace Manuel Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n as Congress President, who announced last November that he would no longer run for office in the next general elections, end his career in public policy, and instead work in the university area for climate protection.
The former minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the President of the government had been constantly pushing for his return to political action.
Moreover, he pointed out that, as in the appointment of the Vice President of Economy, the party did not want to withhold from citizens who would take over the office of the President of Congress in the event of an election victory, and described this as an act of transparency.
If he should actually take office, he hopes to convert the chamber into a house of respect and not of insult or shouting, so as to make it appear more and more similar to citizens.
Regrettably, from time to time you get the impression that the only place where you can't talk quietly and calmly in Madrid is Congress; that's how the president of the government in the Senate was interrupted once to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised the current president Manuel Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n and his good work and indicated that he did not want to make the appearance of having already taken office, otherwise his political opponents would call this arrogance.
Climate Propaganda
As the climate debate puts both the skeptics of climate change and those who put a social and political debate in the forefront of this issue under a relentless criticism, the movement as a whole must demonstrate a strong cohesion.
Especially if it is a leader of the movement who, as in the case of President Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change more important than fighting Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
However, this proposal brings him to the fore with regard to his government's actions or non-actions, which has made a decisive contribution to the fact that Spain is at the top of the EU's list of countries which have least complied with the Kyoto Protocol's requirements.
Who are those responsible for failing to meet the requirements, to which sectors this is due, and why did not his government, which had proposed the treaty with the planet, stop this development.
In addition, he is now forced to present to the Spanish citizens the measures he intends to take against climate change without hesitation.
What companies will be affected by this, what behaviour of citizens should be changed, what individual and collective austerity measures must be implemented and what economic consequences result from this.
More specifically, who will have to sacrifice and pay for the salvation of the planet.
However, there is and will be no such explanation in the future.
This is precisely because it is about sacrifice and payment.
The measures that can be implemented against climate change are unpopular.
They are costly, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the petrol-cent proposed by the PSOE, Zapatero seemed so dangerous from a strategic point of view that he was forced to withdraw the proposal.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, that is, with pure propaganda and empty sayings without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, protocols and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, the otherwise suitable politician for election campaigns must neither speak nor accuse nor demand, but instead pursue the demanding issue of decorating the meetings and inspiring others with his gentleness and kindness.
However, this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not imply that the bicycle will become the only means of transport in the future or we can only refresh ourselves with one compartment.
The mayor and the police chief of Totana due to an alleged involvement in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the popular politician José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo. In addition, the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor's office and a hotel contractor have been arrested for the alleged suspicion of urban construction violations, it said from investigators today.
The city council was arrested at its place of residence, from where it was taken to the municipal office and located in its premises to the present time, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the municipal administration and the municipal construction manager Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are related to the discoveries that have already taken place in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid last Monday, where it turned out that more than 2 million hectares of unexplored building land for urban construction projects under the leadership of Galician construction company Nuaria should be remodeled, which should build 4,000 apartments on the property after the local administration gave it illegal commissions during the last legislative period.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested directly, but were subjected to an investigation initiated and conducted by Totona's first court.
The first six people arrested were presented to the judge today.
According to investigators, it is also being investigated against the former mayor of Totana and current independent PP MP Juan Morales.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current girlfriend residing in Murcia, are suspected.
The chairman and owner of the group Nuaria, the Vigo-based lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A., was arrested in the village of Nigr<0xC3><0xA1>n (Pontevedra), as well as the managing director of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company is said to have been part of Nuaria and received the lubrication money.
The investigations are carried out by the Municipal Authority against urban offences, under the supervision of the Central Unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven further searches, most of them in companies directly related to the arrests that took place in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At this time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry industry, who is said to have acted as a middleman.
The Nuaria sub-assembly was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in the Murcia area, which should include more than 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired more than 2.2 million square kilometres of land in Totana, which was to be converted, with the aim of realising a construction project that would raise the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates in Vigo the parking spaces of the streets of Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, Venezuela and that of Plaza Fernando el Cat<0xC3><0xB3>lico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the direct marketing sector and Preconiza, specializing in the promotion, sale and installation of components.
Things that can happen
1.
If you agree, we will turn away from the term book of the month and instead try to invent a price designation of other names with appropriate competencies.
I already have a proposal.
People, life means change.
Of course, you are welcome to make your suggestions.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the comment published yesterday in the most important Finnish newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat (Finland, by the way, is at the forefront of the PISA study), which refers to the comment published in the same newspaper, on 18 November; incidentally, on the day of its issue, the criticism of the book Blackburns contained.
The content of the subject philosophy has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy surrounding the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the gruesome murders is a high school student who quoted Plato's and Nietzsche's works in his news.
In an interview with Helsingin Sanomat, the chair of the Education Council for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, asked the teachers to take a more critical position towards Plato and suggested that Plato’s teaching be removed from the lower-level curriculum for philosophy in high school.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading a song would be a breach of law that would be dealt with six months in prison.
However, if you rob a music business below a value of 400 euros again, this is only considered a simple violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the business up to a value of 1000 euros, the theft will be classified as a criminal offence, but the penalty is less than in the case of a download (Article 234 Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it forty hours later, the penalty is still lower than with a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less difficult to participate in a beat than in a music data exchange.
Participating in a rebel dispute will result in a prison sentence of three to 12 months (Article 154 Criminal Code), while the data exchange will result in a six-month to two-year detention period.
(Article 270 Criminal Code).
According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment in the workplace is considered to be less bad than downloading a DVD movie from the Internet.
F. whereas trade in copyrighted films, whose authorship has not taken place, is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186);
Well, so if my colleague should be right, then someone has screwed up his demands quite nicely.

My family doctor gives me one of his long, strange research articles entitled: Money leads to activation of certain brain areas, especially when the others get more of it.
So the feelings arising from the monthly salary payment depend on the salary of the colleagues.
The study was prepared using a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the last issue of the Science journal.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonn Brain Research Center Life&Brain, activation was strongest when the participant gave correct answers and his co-player failed.
The researchers were able to see that brain activity was always very moderate when both participants were correct with their response and thus also received the same salary; but if one of them received the double, there was also a stronger brain activity.
I am not entirely sure whether it actually takes so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
The prosecutor from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been searching relentlessly for the criminals of the Balkan wars for eight years. Her office is located in the prosecutor's office of the criminal court of the former Yugoslavia, located in La Haya.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a weeping and a laughing eye, as the main responsible of the Srebrenica massacre – in which eight thousand Bosnian Muslims were killed – is the ex-General Ratko Mladic and the former Serbian-Bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic still on the loose.
Their names are on the list of Swiss-born director Marcel Schüpbach as a template for the title of his documentary films La Liste de Carla (2006, not yet launched in Spain); a film that, with the pace of a political thriller, pursues the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York in its plan to track down the escaped criminals and thus pressurize the respective governments.
Which insurance is best for me?
Car insurance, which covers a possible damage caused by the driver, involves a high cost, the amount of which again depends on various factors, including age, gender, time of creation of the driver's license, marital status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Owning a car is just the beginning.
It is even more difficult to find the right car insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, you need to be clear about what we are dealing with here.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurer.
This agreement is recorded in writing by means of an insurance contract, which stipulates that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and in return is obliged to submit the corresponding compensation amount in case of damage.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance that is composed of several factors, including age, gender, time of creation of the driving licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
Insurance companies set their prices according to statistics, so that higher contribution payments are due in the event of a higher risk of accidents.
For this reason, both over 25-year-olds and women need to make less contribution payments, as statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate thanks to their caution.
The same applies to married persons, since, according to the statistical values and therefore also according to the conviction of the companies, these tend to be fewer accidents than single persons.
The benefits that are attributed to the vehicle affect the frequency of driving and therefore also the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
When setting up the premium, insurance companies must take into account a whole range of points.
For this reason, the driver must also study the situation thoroughly in order to select exactly the car insurance that best meets his personal needs.
At this point, we now list the most important points to consider when choosing an insurance policy in order to be able to make not only a performance, but also a price-oriented choice.
The under 25-year-olds encounter numerous obstacles when choosing cheap insurance, such as low driving practices and young driving licenses.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance cover to take out full-cost insurance, there are still cheaper alternatives.
The cautious drivers can choose a full-cost with self-participation, so that while the benefits of a full-cost insurance are covered, they are offered at a low price.
This type of contract implies that the customer has to pay part of the amount caused by the damage himself.
The amount is set before the conclusion of the contract and on the basis of the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher the lower the amount to be paid, explains Luis Noguera, Spain’s principal representative at First Europe, an online insurance intermediary.
Another option is extended insurance, which insures the customer against external accident damage, but not against the damage caused on their own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's some advice.
If you are under 25 years of age, it is up to you to reduce insurance costs; this is how your credit increases by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the basic rate at the relevant insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment includes an increase in said tariffs.
The amount of credits and penalties depends on the company and its income.
If the company has a profitable year behind it, it may allow itself to increase the bonus payments, Noguera explains.
As soon as the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to sign a contract, which is because with increasing driving practice, the accident rate decreases.
Thus, it is best to opt for a full-cost insurance with self-participation.
Normally, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving, explains the Spanish head of the European company, adding that the majority of the accidents occur in the second year of practice after the fear of the beginner is dropped.
Nevertheless, in the case of a married customer who does not have children, it is more advisable to take out full-time insurance; of course, only if it also allows the financial situation of the person concerned.
Insurers consider married couples with children to be customers with the lowest accident rate, and accordingly, their contribution payments are also low.
In this case, full insurance with self-involvement (with an amount of around 300 euros) would be the best option. In the event that you have received a high credit, an extended insurance policy is recommended, which only starts in the third year of the vehicle.
They drive more relaxed overall and have a greater purchasing power that allows them to set up a higher contribution payment, Luis Noguera states.
For pensioners, it is a good idea to take out a full-cost insurance with self-participation (with an amount of around 150 euros), or an extended insurance, which only starts with a sufficiently high credit.
In the end, you have to keep in mind that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver from possible accident damage, but also because it carries high costs that require a thorough selection to be made that corresponds to our personal situation.
Celtic Glasgow hopes to reach the eighth final in Milan
FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will fight for the point they are missing in San Siro next Tuesday to reach their respective goals even before the end of the Champions League preliminary round. The Italians need the point to get to the top of their group, while he decides on their participation with the Scots.
The Italian team already has five points and have already confirmed their participation in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow needs another with nine points to make sure that the FC Shakhtar with six points does not catch the Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two Group D games will take place one week before the end of the sixth round, as FC Milan will have to compete at the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, where he will fight for the first time to enter the final on the 13th in the semi-final, which will take place on the 16th.
So this group will be finished in front of everyone else and the tie at the Guiseppe Meazza Stadium to the expected result, even if both teams will try to win. The Italians will not want to speculate at home that the Celtics know that they would have a better starting position in the eighth final in case of a victory group starter and thus have a better starting position.
Gordon Strachan's team might even be able to defeat in a slump of FC Shakhtar to qualify, but he should not rely too much on such circumstances, because in nine points of equality the Ukrainians are allowed to participate; they had lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but were able to win in the second game (2-0).
So the Milanese will try to avoid the Scots in the evening, hoping for the second time in a row to reach the eighth final of the redesigned Champions League after they were defeated in the previous season in exactly the same round by a goal from Kaka in the replay time (1-0) and by a zero to zero draw on the playoffs.
While FC Shakhtar is waiting for the victory of the Rossoneri, the team will have to focus on their own game, as both reaching the eighth final and joining UEFA will depend on their victory and a defeat of Celtic Glasgow.
Benfica Lisbon, despite its lower table position and without the prospect of continuing to compete in the biggest European championship, could win third place by winning and thus play at UEFA.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
In Vancouver, Canada, the Spice Girls kicked off their first tour after the band broke up in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) y 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) announced shortly before the start of their concert at GM Place de Vancouver that the mood in the reunited band was excellent.
Around 20,000 people were able to experience the concert in the sold-out stadium, where a video about the band’s history, which had caused a stir at the end of the nineties, was shown.
The reunion and world tour overlap with the release of a new album, which includes its biggest hits and two more new songs, headlines and voodoo, and which will be released in Spain under EMI’s label.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore golden bracelets on stage, which the husband of Posh Spice, English footballer David Beckham, had previously given them.
The athlete was among the crowds in the audience that made GM Palace glow, although the nerves of his wife Victoria had forbidden him in the previous days.
During the preparations for the show, Victoria Beckham said that the British star has never seen our wardrobe, so I’m already curious to see what he will think of the performance.
Sporty Spice, whose departure from the group in 1998 due to internal disagreements two years later led to the dissolution of the group, expressed their nervousness two hours before the concert at a press conference.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world public had changed, that the feelings about the Spice Girls had changed.
And that's why I thought why not; so I'm glad to have made this decision, Chisholm commented on the separation of the band she had caused nine years ago.
The singer also said that the disputes had been resolved and that everyone now enjoys it again.
Nevertheless, many things have changed since the last joint appearance of the Spice Girls in 1998.
First of all, the group arrived in a special engine of Virgin Airlines in Vancouver, according to a report by the television station CTV.
Upon their arrival at the airport, the band was received by an army of nanny.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform next in California, San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
In Madrid, they will enter the stage on December 23.
New fears about natural gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute is brewing between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the risk that Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe will be affected.
The majority of Russian natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) are directed by Ukraine and any dispute between the two nations is closely observed.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will charge Russia higher transit fees.
An earlier conflict between the two states last year reduced deliveries to the EU states.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow happens at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-run gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine has to pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine needs to be calculated more, as the Group has agreed to pay up to 50% additional for natural gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for Gazprom imports.
“It’s important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in talks,” Ukraine’s economic minister Anatoli Kinakh told Reuters.
"The changing natural gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit fees [to Western Europe] over Ukraine."
In the last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom cut deliveries to Ukraine.
As a result, this led to a fall in exports to Western Europe, which dramatically increased prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union’s supply.
Russia has the world’s largest gas deposits, but much of them remain underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service must improve the controls of criminal records for workers from outside Europe, said a member of the control body.
The recommendation of the chief financial controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought along with the attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also expressed concerns that the Scottish state health service had no precise idea as to the number of its foreign employees.
But his report pointed out that other important controls were carried out correctly in a sample of five health authorities.
The chief financial controller investigated personnel recruited outside the European Economic Area countries as a result of the attack on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after an off-road car was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video broadcast at Old Bailey in October, and was charged in connection with the alleged car bomb attack in Britain.
It is expected that the State Health Service will carry out checks in advance of the employment of foreign employees to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorisations to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to verify criminal records, the agency does not have jurisdiction to obtain this information outside the UK.
The main auditor’s report now states, in addition to other recommendations, that the Executive Board should adopt guidelines of the criminal record extract that helps employers with checks in different countries.
"Although we have found evidence of these controls in some personnel records, they have not been routinely carried out," the report noted.
Black said the Scottish health authorities would follow their investigative guidelines to a high degree before hiring, but added, "Our report highlights areas where the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information about the number of foreign health care workers is available."
BMA Scotland Chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was “extremely unlikely” that investigations would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks in advance of hiring potential NHS employees.
"The report says that current pre-employment tests of the NHS Scotland are working well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will deliver," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number is likely to be higher, also because the boards had problems identifying those employees who are on leave indefinitely.
The investigation further noted that established control procedures by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian have been largely complied with.
These include passport, work permit, and qualification checks.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing its policies and guidelines for pre-employment checks for foreign personnel in the NHS.
Nicola Sturgeon, Secretary of Health, said: “It was my concern to carry out this work in the face of the Glasgow airport terrorist attack.”
She added that the Scottish government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices in updated guidelines on control investigations would be reflected in the pre-employment of all employees, including those from abroad, whose publication is scheduled for next month.
Joy Division dominates film award ceremony
Control, the film biography of the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, among others for the best film.
The awards were also given to lead actor Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before being cast for the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and supporting actor Toby Kebbell.
Dame Judi Dench has been named the best lead actress for the Thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond actor Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for bringing the British film to the world public.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division until his 1980 suicide at the age of 23.
The black-and-white film - on whose soundtrack The Killers, David Bowie and New Order can be found - was shot for just <0xC2><0xA3>3 million.
Nevertheless, he has won two awards to Dutch photographer Corbijn, best known so far for the iconic cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree – as the best director and the best directorial debut.
Rock music was the focus of another award winner at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about Clash singer Joe Strummer won the award for best documentary.
The award for Best Actor went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as driver of a Russian mob boss in David Cronenberg’s London-based thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, who stands in the reputation of playing hard guys, has picked up the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award, which was named in honor of the Camelot and Harry Potter stars Harris, who died in 2002.
“There were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me,” he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my type of person, a great actor of his time, I'm really honored."
The independent film awards, known as Bifas, are selected by a group that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia over terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it has arrested 208 militants for belonging to cells that had planned an imminent attack on an oil plant, as well as on clergy and security forces.
The world’s largest oil exporter’s state television said one of the cells had planned to smuggle in missiles.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, as a result of the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the TV report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000-strong rapid intervention force to protect facilities after a failed Al Quaida attack on the world’s largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to an interior ministerial statement, says that 18 of the detainees were part of a cell led by a "missile expert" who illegally immigrated to the country.
He reports that the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom.
Another 22 of the detainees were reportedly planning to kill clerics and security forces.
The government has warned clerics to do more to stop Saudis seeking to join forces with Al Qaeda militias seeking to fight Allied forces and the U.S.-backed Shiite Muslim government deemed heretical by the hardliners among the Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaeda militias view many clerics in Saudi Arabia as cooperating with the authorities in supporting the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militias – accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born Al Qaeda leader to target the pro-Western Saudi government – have targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings, and energy sector facilities.
"This has been a very big effort by the security forces over the last... five months," a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior told state television.
The arrests also concerned a “media cell” of 16 from Medina, which aimed to promote “takfiri thinking” – the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims supporting violence against Muslims branded as infidels and apostates.
Among those arrested, 32 people were also accused of providing financial support to the militias.
The climate on Venus could give a glimpse of the future of Earth
Venus was perhaps once a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spaceship on a orbit show that the planet resembles a distant twin of the Earth even more than it was previously aware.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
The two worlds are about the same size and have similar planetary orbits, but the Venus of the Sun is a bit closer.
Billions of years ago, conditions on Venus would have been very similar to those on Earth and could even have been habitable, scientists believe today.
But because of the unbraked carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation and a slower rate of rotation, Venus took a completely different course of development.
Today, the planet is deprived of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency’s Venus Express spacecraft, which examined the plants for a year, provide a sobering look at how the Earth could develop in the face of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Physics Department at Oxford University, one of the leaders of the Venus Express Mission, said, "It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that of Earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar."
"Our new data allows us to construct a scenario in which Venus began billions of years ago like Earth, possibly with a habitable environment."
"Enriched uranium" seized by police
A kilo of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and that the material was being tested.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
Everything is still open
Mitt Romey said he does not consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the presidency ultimately agreed to take up a debate on YouTube, where normal voters take questions on video and submit them to send them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday evening, November 28 were as ridiculous as the snowman who questioned Democrats about global warming in the other party’s YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time accurately reflected the state of the Republican Party that is breaking up in the next year’s elections.
It is not known, just like the producers of CNN who supported the debate with the YouTube clips to be shown to prospective candidates.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, the longest one devoted to a single topic, immigration was the focus.
The theme is one of the most powerful themes for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of undecided voters to use a dial when they heard things they liked: The television station noticed peaks of approval as the candidates spoke strictly across borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Romney, who pushed forward in the crucial polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tries to shake off the call that he had been lenient about illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in which he accused the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants for work at his home.
The two were particularly fiercely questioning whether one of the candidates would support an “amnesty” (which would give illegals a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Substantial candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, managed to catch up on this issue.
None of the two men have any serious chances in the nomination, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they used to rush on the immigration dent earlier and harder than others.
At least in the area of immigration, the candidates broadly share the same views: sharper borders, intolerance towards illegal migrants.
This topic, along with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic when other issues were raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he supported weapons restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the respondents asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
As a result, Giuliani took the view that although the Bible is his favorite book, he may not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee – now in first place against all expectations in a recent survey conducted in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism – said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When asked if Jesus would support them, he laughed at it and said Jesus was too intelligent to apply for a political office.
The race remains exceptionally wide open.
Huckabee’s rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul’s recent donation successes and his applause storms in Wednesday’s debate.
These two have been shot out of nowhere because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the more well-known and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate has joined the party from the beginning and convincingly with a victorious message about the size of America and a wink on both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered another pit to fall in; his way out of it remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly sloppy.
No titles of nobility seem to have been sold, no politicians in Paris paid hotel bills, no extramarital toes have been extinguished.
But the discovery that a wealthy businessman has veiled donations for the British ruling Labour Party over more than <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 ($1.3 million) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this, is something that the struggling Gordon Brown would have done well without.
When, two months ago, the Prime Minister had evaded the demand for an election, demeaningly insulting the intelligence of the British by claiming that opinion polls had not influenced this decision, there was hope that he would provide a robust, efficient government.
Instead, like Vince Cable, the increasingly keen representative of the Liberal Democrats, expressed it, the once feared Brown from Stalin has evolved into Mr. Bean.
Northern Rock’s unskilled rescue, a battered bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Poorly thought-out proposals to change tax laws have brought corporate associations against the government.
The tax-exempt loss of personal data of 25 million people showed unimaginable administrative hoaxes.
A trio of retired generals started an uprising in the upper house in protest of cuts in military spending: being a minister of the armed forces, they claimed, was a part-time job.
Now there are the diverse donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour’s Secretary-General (and her former fulfillment manager) has already resigned.
None of this means that Brown is irrevocably breaking up in the direction of resignation.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point where they find it impossible to govern.
Neither do people like or trust politicians, but they usually hold back their skepticism when a new force takes office.
Once it is clear that a prime minister is unlikely to improve the situation, and he does not even need to be around for long, this postponement is over: the public service is beginning to become leaky; the cabinet ministers are beginning to chat; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is becoming defensive and aimless.
In a way, Brown’s position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new broom.
As much as he wanted to deny Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant colonel.
The problems with Northern Rock and tax jurisdiction records, for example, are related to decisions made by Brown as Chancellor of the Treasury.
And even if he wasn’t directly involved in Blair’s mishap — as with the long “money for nobility” investigation of political party funding — voters may assume he was.
Still, Brown's situation isn't quite as bad as it looks
The failures are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
As with Mr. Bean, no one has died, or has been completely swindled.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown’s naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new witness to political donations is a good example.
The Garboesque Abraham, who compares his donations to his charitable gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his goodwill.
That may be the case, but the decision on it did not allow him.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
Watt, who says he knew of Abraham’s agreement, but not that it is illegal, will of course have to ask himself some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour’s main financier, who was told about the strange donations in October.
However, Brown is not involved so far: there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these confusions, although most of the payments were made after his takeover in June.
So far, the prime minister has done half of the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he diluted this determination by grasping for a well-known instrument, an investigative committee on the subject – led to the completion of the measure, by a bishop in retirement and a judge.
In this case, the "teachings to be drawn from" are not very complicated.
If the law was broken, it's a matter for the police.
Apart from that, there are other things Mr Brown has to do to find a permanent chairman of the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has been vacant for six months, and to move forward with a sweeping reform of political party funding.
This would require the hardliners of the Labour Party to cooperate with the Conservatives and possibly give up the special financial relationship with the unions - bitter pills for a party mate like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partisan facts.
Conservatives now have a clear lead in opinion polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can achieve victory is through undisputed justice and solid competence.
Map sharks
Is the credit crisis affecting America’s credit card market?
When blood is in the water, it is only natural that back fins swirl excitedly around.
Now that America’s real estate market is crumbling, predators are targeting the country’s credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts estimate that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the risk of underfunded credit spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both the severance payments and the default rates, which measure the proportion of loans that are in each case ineligible or are more than 30 days late.
HSBC has announced last month that it has taken a $1.4 billion fee hike from its U.S. consumer financing, in part due to the weakness of credit card holders.
It’s too early to panic.
Losses and losses are still low.
According to the rating agency Moody, the third-quarter seam rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
A change in the U.S. Private Insolvency Laws in 2005 resulted in an abrupt case of bankruptcy filings, which in turn account for a large part of the Kedit card losses; the number of filings (and thus severance fees) would rise again, whether the general conditions for borrowers deteriorate or not.
Industry also reports solid payment rates showing how much of its debt consumers pay off each month
and confidence in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the stagnation in other corners of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup, a research company, expects spending volumes for 2007 to ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
Direct channels of infection between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: it is more likely that consumers will absorb credit card debt, now that home loans are drying out.
However, card issuers look at the cash flow rather than capital values, so falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the borrower’s creditworthiness.
They can even be beneficial for card issuers.
Incentives for consumers who continue to pay mortgage rates fall when real estate is less valuable than the value of the loan; as a result, card debt among repayment priorities becomes more important.
Card issuers can also respond much faster and more flexibly than lenders to the stormier conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid revaluation of assets.
“We’re not going to wake up one day and re-evaluate the loans completely,” says Gary Perlin, Capital One’s main financial advisor.
Even if a sudden undercover crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustainable downturn are significantly more real.
When lower house prices and a credit reduction push America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a grimer future.
Keep an eye out for these shark fins.
British bankers plead guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who were to be tried for their role in the fraudulent system with Enron’s former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, changed their appeals to guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally pleaded innocently for seven cases of fraud using telecommunications funds for allegedly conspiring with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure was scheduled for January.
But during a hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone pleaded guilty to a case of fraud using telecommunication means.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, were announced in the UK in the course of extradition proceedings that lasted two years.
In the United States, her case is a loose end to an investigation that started after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The allegations originally filed against them in 2002 drew Fastow's attention to the fact that he was the target of an investigation by the government in connection with the Enron decline.
The indictment against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claims they had come to Houston in 2000 to hedge a fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top adviser Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a partnership of Enron controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron companies that helped tear the company into the bankruptcy strudel.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated the value of its participation in the subsidiary to be zero, but the three British men knew that it was in fact of considerable value.
A company under Kopper’s control acquired the bank’s shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely told Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others slashed about $12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty in two counts of conspiracy for his role in the Enrons Pleite.
The British trio were arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year prison sentence in the Federal Prison of Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a three-year and one-month sentence in a Texarkana facility.
Each of the three men was free on the basis of a $1 million bail, which required them to live in the United States pending trial.
Enron, once the nation’s seventh-largest company, crumbled in bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks could no longer conceal billions of debts or make debilitating businesses appear profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value, and more than two billion dollars of retirement plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year for their roles in the Enron collapse.
Skilling is punishable by more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud, and other charges became null and void after he died last year of heart disease.
Not at the bottom of Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least $54 million.
But that’s small money for some of the rich Russians.
“It can accommodate up to 18 passengers,” said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
“But none of you ask for so many seats because it’s for a private family or a corporate president.”
Firer was at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the millionaire exhibition, a four-day orgy of consumer displayed in a nested exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury vendors had built exhibition stands, hoping to interest newly-funded Russians in everything from mahogany-lined yachts to diamond-lined car grilles that would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Firer carefully targeted a shiny orange Porsche next to the booth.
“This is a nice car, but it’s small cash compared to us,” he said.
“According to the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft.”
Fueled by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems so flooded with money like Dallas at its heyday.
“We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to gigantic wealth and went to Europe in crowds where they were considered materialistic,” said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arabian overflyers of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians emerge as the most visible free-lanced money-publishers in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the gold rush.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, a conference of luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH, has attracted ideas on how to sell high-priced goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, which is owned by the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires who own a total of 282 billion dollars, according to Forbes’ list of richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, worth a total of $670 billion, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts from the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, an expert panel here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005 15.8 percent of Russians lived below the subsistence minimum.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow — that’s why we’re all here,” said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweler.
She had visited the fair for the first time together with the Russian retailer of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
“The women are all well-groomed and the men are all worth a fortune.”
As they move through the halls on Sunday night in evening clothes, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, call themselves and their clients millionaires.
"I looked at the cars and I tried to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she was wearing, like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The fair seemed to be aimed primarily at the new realms, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to spend several hours in a jam to visit a sprawling warehouse, which flawlessly puts Cadillac Escalades, pocket knives made of platinum, Mövenpick ice cream, custom-made billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund Teddy Bear next to each other.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
“The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best,” said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a fair stand of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a Rembrandt image made of hand-painted blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in Klimper-Klimper."
In fact, traders here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old according to Russian standards) have already moved from large-scale logos to the kind of sober brands with limited quantities that would not market at a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millionaires, envoys of millionaires or simply tourists pushed through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil Betten here, said he had sold two $70,000 mattress sets, made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with sewn-in gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, told a company providing high-end cars with high-end alarm systems that his company had sold the bright orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for $170,000.
Until Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that adapts luxury cars to customer needs, said he had sold three car cooler grilles for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, the same chain bracelets, for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter a car tire designed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes he had covered with colored Swarovski crystals, making it look like a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for a four-replacement.
“The Russian millionaire, who wants a ostrich leather wheel or a picture of his wife’s face from cubic zirconium, will not necessarily ride on these wheels,” Mr. Karapetian said.
"He'll keep it in his 30- or 40-car garage."
Even though many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian said the phrase "Russian millionaires" would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the rise in local real estate prices.
“If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they’re probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash,” he said.
“There are more of them than you think.”
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend they were rich at a stand run by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four British-style red telephone cells that were jammed with mountains of fake million dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing director, said his employees had printed 500,000 false banknotes for the millionaire trade fair.
Passersby stopped to throw around the piles of money, cell phone photos as they lean back in the middle of the spare wealth, let friends snap, or just to plug in a few million.
“Look, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire,” Mr. Karryev said.
Suspected operation suspected of death in New Jersey
It was the day before the Thanksgiving celebration when Ronald Livingston saw through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched as an ambulance stopped at the white Cape Cod two doors down on West Scott Avenue.
Soon after, there was a police car.
And then there was another.
“Then I saw the doctor’s bodyguard’s box car coming in,” Livingston, a restaurant supervisor, said on Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew someone had died."
The hearings learned that the dead woman Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine if she died due to a procedure carried out by an unauthorised cosmetic surgeon, who the police did not identify, and who worked in the house on West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet determined what caused Mrs. Arroyo's death, and are hopeful that toxicological investigations, whose results may not be available for weeks, will help to unravel a mysterious death that has sent a grief through the leadership of the Newark Police Department.
Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was well known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard-working, and persistent," Mr McCarthy said about Mrs. Arroyo in a telephonic interview on Wednesday.
"She was my pit bull.
She protected me.”
McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer working for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she left behind two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union County prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow, said investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorised surgical treatment.
“That’s one of the options,” Mrs. Walsh said.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
Authorities said they arrived at the house at about 3 a.m. in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on the spot.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have communicated little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't want to say if Mrs. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
The investigators are trying to determine whether a part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs. Castro's house, where a withered rose bush stands in the narrow front garden and a Dalmatian barks behind the house.
A blue barrel labeled "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - sat in the parking lot next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he arrived in Newark for the first time after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was invaluable and helped him navigate the provincial and hard political culture in his new city.
"She said, 'You have to pay attention to this or that,'" he said.
“She was always here when I got here and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing.”
Hopes that the central bank will lower interest rates lead to an increase in world stock markets
The shares jumped yesterday on both sides of the Atlantic after market hopes that the central bank will try to calm the credit markets by further interest rate cuts were bolstered by humiliating comments from the vice president of the US central bank.
Stock markets rose in London, New York, and across Europe after Donald Kahn, number 2 of Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the central bank, said policies must respond “flexibly and pragmatically” to the ongoing pressure on financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm thrifty markets, given signs of emerging credit tensions, Kohn said the recent turbulences had “partially reversed some of the improvements in market functions from late September and October.”
Should the increased turbulence persist, it would increase the possibility of further tightening of financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken up by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to intervene and to stabilise credit conditions with new capital injections into the US markets and possible further interest rate cuts.
The statements also helped calm Wall Street, given further bad news from the U.S. economy, now that sales of U.S. real estate reached a new record low in October.
The consequences of financial turbulence have been highlighted by Bear Stearns, the investment bank, announcing that it will eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of its global workers, in a cost reduction measure to offset heavy losses from their lost bets in the U.S. mortgage lending sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these jobs will disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the wider-scale S&P 500 Index rose by 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6,306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds to the value of UK standard values.
Germany’s Dax index rose by 2.6 percent and France’s CAC40 rose by 2.3 percent.
Previously, the resurgence of credit pressures on the markets had been underlined after strong demand for a three-month European Central Bank guarantee auction granted to the European Commercial Banks was conspicuously given 4.7 percent, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England, the U.S. Central Bank and the European Central Bank to follow suit, and to feed further capital into the money markets in London, increased as credit tensions saw the three-month “Libor” rates of borrowing between UK banks rise by 6.59 percent to their highest since late September, after a continuous increase since November 21.
England faced with decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each of them almost as difficult as the other.
Who will be the number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the election chairman, is calling for at least this special title, here to help the head coach Peter Moore and captain Michael Vaughan to decide, and because the table of High Morries, the English managing director, is gradually filling itself with applications for national electorates, if not for some part-time.
Whoever doesn’t get the sixth racket position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and the sport is undoubtedly.
It’s never easy to pinpoint exactly what allows a person to reach the top of his profession, while someone else never gets beyond the lowest rank, sometimes for lack of happiness rather than ability.
It is not only in cricket where the selection is difficult, where judgments are necessary, which are always subjective in the end.
Is it the right time to go to Bopara?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same may also be asked in another area, for example, whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young executives with good degrees who know the business well, should be promoted.
Who can say what the right class is for a cricketer unless he is given the opportunity to swim or go down.
Of course, numbers have a big impact on decisions, but chances also have this.
Within a team, a cricketer must catch the captain’s eye at the right time if he can take a wicket and a bat must get regular chances on the order if he wants to make an impression as a one-day cricketer.
Catching the eyes of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who were better in the last season than, for example, James Anderson, who will apparently play in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison declares himself healthy and how the wind cones into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets with 33 runs each to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hope for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays at Asgiriya Stadium can only be a question of view.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, still struggling to solidify himself, who made the breakthrough into a major test cricketer and who, although scoring a double hundred against Australia in Australia, may still be underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, following a further discussion during today’s network meeting at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and gut feeling for Shah’s greater experience of Bopara’s youthful enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable 88 Test debut innings speaks in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six from Bopara, who is seven years younger at the age of 22, and an excellent balance against turned balls.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the Test in Lord, his home arena as a Middlesex player, and this, plus his immediate rejection from the selectors as Vaughan was healthy to take back his position for the next game, seems to have taken the swing out of his blow, which was still evident in Bombay.
In contrast, the all-rounder from Essex has a lot of joy in life.
He is not impressed by anything on a cricket ground and his attitude was brought to the point when he had recently knocked over a four-wheel drive vehicle in an exhibition for England’s sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to pick out his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had observed this from a distance, and say with enthusiasm, "Have you seen this?"
Bopara is a much better field player, he cones his mid-tempo with some effect here on the playing fields, which seems to fit him and beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time another.
Perhaps this is the real art of selection.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which doesn’t mean that Shah might not stand well if, as the tea set from Ceylon suggests, he’s the one who’s going to play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work – and to fight Al-Quaida
The first busloads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced people whose funds or visas expired, and others hoping the city would return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the rebels they had driven out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operating with refugees from Syria and Jordan returning in private transport.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad,” said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on television and what I read in the newspaper, about what happened in Baghdad and how it would now be safe."
They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shiite militias of militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to be resettled at this time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the Iraqi regime was not allowed to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local U.S.-backed militia helped drive Al-Qaeda out of its bastion in the west of the capital, forcing him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been driven out of his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by an assault with hand grenades after he had asked his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started one of the anti-Al-Qaeda militias in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my boys.
That’s why I returned today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said that they had been lured by the increasing calm in the capital since the U.S. troop increase and the growth of local "groups of affected citizens" who had been armed and defending their neighborhoods in cooperation with the U.S. military.
But more spoke of being forced home by visa problems and slurping funds in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-time father, expressed the general suspicion among exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, had requested the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees in order to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have fled the sectarian death squads in the country.
"We went well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government urged the Iraqis not to give any more visas to force them to return to Iraq," the Sunni pensioner said.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the decline of violence is that Sunnis were driven out of Shiite residential areas and vice versa, which led to the creation of many places where tensions have subsided.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will reinvigorate sectarian tensions and there will be conflicts.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state is a leader in vocational education and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in an educational field does the Saar countries express the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I declared yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Saar country that we are not French" - this slogan posterizes the smallest federal state self-ironically for its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of the Saarland, which is ranked fifth in the educational monitor of the Institute of the German Economy Cologne (IW).
In this way, universities already cooperate closely with neighbouring countries from a tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple diploma.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is 15.6 percent.
But also the state children bring the Saarland in an above-average number to the universities - many of them without a degree at the gymnasium.
"In Saarland, the vocational education system is used," says Axel Plünnecke, an education expert at the IW.
More than one in five young people acquires their right to study at a vocational school, which means that the Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The combination of vocational and academic training is also comparatively well developed.
Based on the population, the equipment with dual degree programmes is the second best in Germany.
However, despite practical training and increasing demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
“In general education schools, after the first Pisa study, we initiated several reforms,” says a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
For example, the government introduced country-wide comparative tests.
In order for the children to start learning earlier, the last year of the Kita is free of charge - a model that now also copies other federal states.
Whether the performance of the students will improve sustainably will only show future comparative studies.
In Pisa 2003, the proportion of high-risk students decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
Overall, however, the Saarland did not increase as strongly as other federal states.
Bayern are better off.
And to the detriment of the Saar countries, foreign language skills at Pisa are not measured - otherwise you could score points in this area.
Because the language of the neighbors is compulsory in high schools - even if the Saar countries are not French.
Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez to change the clocks
In Venezuela, the clocks will soon be ticking differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez ordered the timepieces to be turned back in the South American country by half an hour.
In Spain, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez becomes a joke figure.
According to a new law, the clocks are set for the world time minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that is not available in any other country in the world.
The US-hostile Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez justified his decision, among other things, by the fact that the United States imposed on the world the division into time zones at full hours.
In addition, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez announced on Wednesday (local time) that a hostage affair would result in the cancellation of relations with neighboring Colombia.
The left nationalist said as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, he would not maintain relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
“I can’t do this because of my dignity,” said Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform that the citizens of the oil country have to vote on Sunday in a referendum.
With the reform, he would significantly expand his power in the country.
Uribes’ decision to withdraw Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez’s mandate to negotiate with Marxist rebels in Colombia was the cause of the dispute, which involved the release of hostages.
Uribe had "split Venezuela in the face" with his decision, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez had criticized on Sunday.
Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez is also spoken in Spain.
A new cell phone ringtone in the country makes a lot of noise: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you keep your mouth shut) is the phrase that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the Internet.
Spain’s King Juan Carlos spoke to him, who at the recent Ibero-America summit was annoyed by the left-wing populist’s constant calls and had driven him over his mouth.
German Threats 2007 Wage Minus
Despite the strong economic downturn, German workers are facing a real wage loss this year, according to a forecast.
Experts called a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler-Stiftung, employees in 2007 could expect less in the salary account in real terms than in the previous year.
“This is due to the modest wage development, the increase in value added tax and the price fluctuations in food and energy,” said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research of the Bild newspaper.
New burdens could also be placed on workers in unemployment insurance.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück said the "New Osnabrück newspaper" that the planned reduction in unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the turn of the year was correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the Federal Employment Agency should not be embarrassed again to ask the federal government for loans or grants, the SPD politician was quoted as saying.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the price explosion in food and mineral oil products drove the inflation rate to the highest level for 13 years.
Prices increased by 3.0 per cent year-on-year.
Venus is the Hellish Twin of the Earth
Venus, despite its hostile atmosphere, is more similar to Earth than before: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered flashes in the atmosphere and wind vortices on the poles, as they occur on Earth in winter.
For almost three decades, scientists have suspected that it is flashing on Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" has provided evidence - it detected electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: the flashes on Venus shoot at an altitude of around 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "Ursuppen theory", lightning has created life on Earth: thunderstorms are said to have stimulated reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: “If there ever was life there, it must have been in very early history,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there is hardly anything living on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
“Venus is perhaps the devil’s twin on Earth, but it’s a twin,” Russel said.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in mass and size, has made such a completely different development, is the fundamental question of the Esa mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, as since the early 1990s, no probe was specifically on the way to explore this planet.
The latest research results, which are now presented in several "Nature" articles, do not only underline the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system, according to the researchers.
"They also show that the similarities of our neighbor planet with the Earth are greater than initially assumed," Esa said.
In addition to the already known whirlwind at the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud strudel at the South Pole, which rotates much faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in the terrestrial winter hemisphere, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second-tenth planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is almost the same size with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.
The planet, also known as the morning or evening star, orbits the sun in just 225 days.
But it is much slower: a Venus Day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus barely recalls Earth at surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, scientists assume that both planets were formed under very similar conditions.
Both gathered water, which remained on Earth in oceans, but on which Venus was lost to space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on Earth in carbonate rocks, it makes up the majority of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler called for an end to the party dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama in the chancellor's office.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPD for its attacks on the chancellor after the September meeting.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about the reputation of Germany and has called on the great coalition to end the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue," Köhler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler signaled his understanding of the reception of the Dalai Lama by German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
“Human rights have universal validity for me, even if I have respect for the diversity of cultures,” Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany must maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, the Federal President stressed, but took Merkel into protection from the accusation that she is pursuing a new China policy.
"The Federal Chancellor has not distanced herself from traditional one-China policy.
China knows that too,” Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed dismay at the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked by ranks of the Union.
Steinmeier had, among other things, complained about the Union's "window policy" in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery, there were severe irritations in the German-Chinese relationship.
For example, the Chinese leadership not only invited the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue of the Foreign Ministries of both countries, according to the SPIEGEL.
China’s head of government, Wen Jiabao, has now asked Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit the reception of the Dalai Lama as a mistake.
China rejects it when European politicians officially receive the Tibetan religious leader, Wen Jiabao reaffirmed the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama showed that he was trying to separate Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other present-day provinces, from China.
Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble warns of riots as in France
Street battles with police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble warns of riots like in France.
Everything must be done so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not lead to violence on the streets, the Federal Minister of the Interior said.
Barricades burned, randaliers shot at the police with shotguns: after the heavy youth riots in France, Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
“We need to make sure that we don’t build up social explosives and discharge them into violence.
We have to take this seriously," he told the New Press, which appeared in Hanover.
Not every young person can cope with the rapid change in social reality.
The federal government, states and municipalities were already working hard to reduce problems, Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble said.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
“From the integration summit to the Islam conference, this is already showing its first successes.”
However, it is too early for a warning.
Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble pointed out at the same time that there are no urban and sociological problems in German suburbs like in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, youths had been carrying police in the past nights in serious street battles.
Also in Toulouse, cars and public buildings burned.
However, the chairman of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat, called for greater integration efforts by the German government.
In the face of the riots in France, Kolat warned of "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany is not as sharp as in France.
But there is still a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people with a migration background under 25 years of age is "above average".
In particular, more training places must be provided.
Kolat stressed: "We need to give young people a perspective."
The chairman of the Turkish community added, however, that in Germany more than in France "social control takes place in the families".
Many young people with a migrant background did not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat warned, "But we still have to be careful."
The young people must be given the opportunity to participate in work and education "as quickly as possible".
Meanwhile, it remained largely quiet at night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police were in service, a helicopter flew over the area with headlights.
The competent authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning trash cans and cars.
Since the day before, a bid of around 1000 security forces has provided peace and quiet.
The police will go through as long as necessary, interior minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburbs.
At night on Tuesday, about 80 police officers were injured at riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The following night, the riots took over Toulouse.
The riots ignited a traffic accident in which two young people were killed on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the prosecutor's office, the police are not to blame for the death of the young people.
In the Kingdom of Angela Wolke
The chancellor’s remote appearance documents the fact that the coalition is at the end of its content – and that nothing can be expected of herself anymore.
In which country does this Chancellor actually live?
After her tireless appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was fierce and low in content, one has to say: not here - not in the country that would finally have to be ruled by her.
The accusation that they focus too much on foreign policy has been rejected by Angela Merkel with a rather overbearing sentence.
That was provincial, she said, and first showed that she does not want to understand what the critics are about.
In the Bundestag, it has clearly documented to everyone how much their accusation is true.
There was no concrete interest or even a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke: an uplifted politician who flees into foreign policy and remains in jeopardy even there.
For example, climate protection: It praises itself for the decisions of Heiligendamm, but does not say how the climate goals are to be achieved in this country.
At all, the self-loathing - so much inequity the CDU chief would have failed two years ago.
Now she clings to the floss that the upswing is coming to the people.
In doing so, she damages her image as a pragmatist, which solves problems rather than speaking the world beautifully.
But in the realm of Angela Wolke, domestic political problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the worries of low earners?
She has a few extras left for it.
It is significant how often she promises to do so when it comes to child support.
Merkel needs three approaches to bring out a half straight sentence.
It stumbles like on a foreign terrain when it becomes concrete.
Department of Attacks
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favourites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are making a hard change – and now have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already unleashed on the first topic.
He has made New York a “place of refuge for illegal immigrants,” Mitt Romney accuses his counterpart Rudy Giuliani.
"I would say his own house was a haven for illegals," Giuliani replied, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of employing private immigrants without papers.
The candidates blow to the attack: because the Republican base continues to have no clear favorites, the eight presidential candidates use the debate on CNN above all to discredit their opponents.
The self-made 30-second videos that Internet users have submitted via YouTube are hardly more than keywords.
"With this kind of isolationism, we have brought Hitler to power," John McCain accuses his counterpart Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round demanding an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Also, Romney is strongly read by Vietnam veterans as he refuses to condemn the so-called "waterboarding", a method of interrogation where drowning is simulated as torture.
However, the fact that the important topics of the campaign are now beyond Iraq war and torture debates shows the reaction of the audience in St. Petersburg, Florida.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected, applause flares up in the auditorium.
Once again, it shows where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney explains, squandering and abetting in front of base and television audiences that he was still one of the abortion advocates in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, comes into slinger when he is asked about his opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civilian life
One day after his resignation as army commander, Pakistani leader Musharraf was sworn in as president.
This will end eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan’s President Pervez Musharraf has been sworn in for another five-year term on Thursday.
Pakistani television broadcasted the ceremony live in the Presidential Palace of Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the Constitution and act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had handed over his position as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, thus bowing to international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after his seizure of power in a bloodless military coup, the former general now rules for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With his resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a core demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is an end to the state of emergency imposed by Musharraf on November 3.
Soon after his abdication, Musharraf will, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, lift the state of emergency and thus fulfill another Western demand.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied with him after the imposition of the state of emergency at the beginning of November, had rejected all objections to the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four others injured in an attack on a military convoy in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The Fathers of Krautrock Return
Germany’s supergroup of the seventies is playing again: The three band members of Harmonia re-imagined their consoles at a concert in Berlin.
A recording from her great time "Live 1974" appears for the revival.
Even then, they were much more famous abroad.
The intended sensation then occurs in the form of three set gentlemen at the evening table.
Everyone has their box in front of them, their cables and, above all, their buttons.
Dieter Moebius sits in a flower-white shirt with 63 years in the middle.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years old and owned by laptop and guitar.
On the right, from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, focuses on the console.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally adds up to a traditional piece of music.
This does not seem to bother the men themselves very much.
The fact that the band is playing Harmonia again has caused some excitement among Krautrock lovers.
One can reveal here: Targeted requests revealed that while the name was swirling through collective pop memory, it was by no means so sustainable to miss this band painfully for 32 years.
But why shouldn’t the German be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the seventies?
In particular, what is misleadingly called Krautrock was always considered more in England and America than in one’s own country.
When the music industry awarded the Kölner Group Can 2003 Echo Prize for Life’s Work to the survivors, German pop faces were seen in the hall.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the Laudatio, the surprise knew no bounds.
Michael Rother later sat on stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old pal.
The problem of ignorance at home and the explanation in the stranger is the one.
The memory is already overburdened with Harmonia, because the trio only existed for two years and during this time also developed a far lower power of action than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously performed under the promising name Cluster with the artist Conrad Schnitzler.
At first they played in the basement under the Berliner Schaubühne.
After that in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label maintained by the church.
Rother had briefly helped out at Kraftwerk and subsequently gained a reputation as a guitarist at Neu!, the then perhaps most radical German group.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the cluster musicians into exile forst in the Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a ruin from the 16th century, they lived as city-volunteer Communards.
Less ideologically than in the Commune I, where Roedelius was allowed to torment himself as a nanny.
Rather in an artistic way.
A pennant of the vocal association Harmonia Ottenstein and a name for art was also reportedly found in the garbage.
Some held Harmonia by it.
The first album was called "Music of Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
Because as quiet and modest as the music sounded, the band suffered material distress.
The gathering of rice did not serve solely to find oneself.
The now released CD "Live 1974" was co-cut at a concert in Griessem, in front of a nearly 50-headed record-setting setting, which someone believes to be reminiscent of.
From Rother came the desire to force harmonies and practice them occasionally.
For Roedelius and Moebius an unspeakable demand.
The band declared their separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the Esoteric-Spherical and secured his existence with albums such as "Flaming Hearts".
Cluster was revived in the 1980s and has been more successful since then than Harmonia had ever been.
The Griessemer live album is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its record company Greenland has set itself the goal of maintaining the Krautrock as its own German contribution to live music.
New! has already been excavated as Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is there, the British, Altpunk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the love parade inventor Dr. Motte.
With which the entire range of influences of the Krautrock would be outlined on the subsequent pop music.
Harmonia fills the empty space of the supergroup.
Brian Eno’s sentence floats with the most unique sounds in the hall: “The only true music, you belong to the future.”
There are pictures showing the producers with Harmonia in the Bauernstube.
Legend formation is used to project further black and white photos of wired devices.
Before that, the three veterans are again engaged in improvisation.
No longer by attaching microphones to the organ and to the drums to unheard of sounds from the instruments via self-basketed effects devices.
Today electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in-depth technical fanciers.
The choir of the house does not change that either.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgensterns is coughed and whispered under sound clouds and sung in a beautiful place with emphase "Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never rock.
The roots were sought less in the blues than in music colleges (Can), technologies (power plant) or on the run from artistic and social conventions (clusters).
Whoever calls here "'68!" is not entirely wrong, and Harmonia cannot be taken away from it even now.
The most obvious thing is that the stage is thoroughly covered.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can rob you of your nerves or give you fleeting moments of great happiness.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Murderian Peace", two films deal with the Balkan War.
But both do not convince.
Either the concepts rely too much on action and balls or they are too moving.
Richard Gere in The Hunting Party can't help either.
The good news first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the Balkans mountains, but only there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian war, actor Richard Gere has now been found.
We had recently lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, because all too many net-important roles in women’s well-being films and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism exude a desire to see.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at "The Hunting Party - When the Hunter Becomes the Hunted" (Why do film titles have to be as long and tangled as locomotive fare contracts today?) perhaps.
He gives a wonderfully eye-catching presentation: in essence, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have become of Gere if fate and the film industry were not so gracious: a man who has long been behind his very best times, but who himself, as a ruinous monument to his demise, still preserved considerable remnants of the former charm.
But despite this Trump campaign, "The Hunting Party" along with German production "Murderian Peace", which also starts this week, continues only the endless series of failed Balkan war films.
The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who rescue a Serb from Kosovar snipers, and the one promptly falls in love with her.
Although it is welcome that once the Serbs are not portrayed as the sole root of all evils, the TV-flat film is all too quickly lost in balls and action.
It remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but with war for it.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" is an example of why there has never been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who set out to track down the Serbian war criminal "the fox" could perhaps have become a new "apocalypse now" with another director and another screenwriter (both in personal union Richard Shepard) at another time.
Because the stories are similar: both times small teams go into the woods to accomplish something the military can’t do and both times it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that you don't just let Simon Hunt be the downed cynic with heart when he is introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also enunciate a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian.
"The Hunting Party" finally goes down the stream when within the last five minutes of the time-lapse process, the reporters succeed in what NATO, CIA and all bounty hunters in the world have failed in five years: catch the war criminal and leave the Muslim Bosnians for just revenge.
This is so bad that you want to call the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against the Kinologik.
The film has a profoundly humane concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still running around freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they should exceptionally agree) not to pursue the persecution too intensively due to secret political agreements.
But the well-intentioned and the evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's desk: "Compassionately I see the swollen foreheads, indicating how exhausting it is to be evil".
Movies like "The Hunting Party" have exactly those thresholds, but they suggest how exhausting it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of Balkan war film.
Recently, it has been reported in this newspaper that all Iraq movies were Hollywood’s big flops.
You can add: There has never been a good South Africa movie.
Almost always, when a star moves around the world’s crisis herds or minefields, something like “Rangoon” comes out with Patricia Arquette, “Beyond All Borders” with Angelina Jolie or “Blood Diamonds” with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Perhaps all the conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, decades had to pass before Hollywood could make a good movie about the Holocaust with Schindler’s list.
Some films will probably mature - the now classic Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" have by no means been hailed as masterpieces at the time.
But maybe today we know where every mass murder comes home in real time on two screens, too much about the conflicts of the world.
And that robs the screenwriters of the carelessness it takes to tell good stories.
After all, "being or not being" or "The Great Dictator" has also become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
You may not want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Perhaps you need to have the sarcasticly distanced artist look of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about parallels between his historical novel "Lempri<0xC3><0xA8>re's Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "This is only because some things never change.
Large cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be cruelly murdered and war will always reign in Yugoslavia."
Beust picks up criticism for Olympic cancellation
The resignation of the mayor of Hamburg from the application for the Summer Olympics has come to severe criticism in politics and business.
Many want to continue fighting for the games on the water.
But from Beust, realism encourages the assessment of opportunities.
The chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described a resignation on Wednesday as "not good for the business location".
No other project has recently developed as large motivational forces in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, the sport-political momentum would not be maintained to the same extent."
Schmidt-Trenz urged the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach to it, "which is based on a changed time ray."
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday with earlier statements that the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic at least until 2028.
"Not Hamburg decides on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," said Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sportbund expected for the beginning of December on an application from Munich for the 2018 Winter Games.
"For us, this preference means that we will not have any realistic opportunities in the period we have been thinking about until 2028."
However, the dream was not dreamt out for all time, said von Beust.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) regretted the statements made by Beusts.
This gives the impression that Hamburg will no longer apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
“It’s too early to take a chance by burying the plans at this point,” HSB President Günter Pl<0xC3><0xB3>s said on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application is also in contradiction with the Senate chief’s statement on the occasion of a reception to the General Assembly of the German University Sports Association.
There, Beust called Hamburg's application for the 2015 Universiade "not as a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Hochschulsportverband had only nominated Hamburg as an applicant city last week.
The SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion accused the Senate of not using valuable time for housing in Hamburg.
"The development of Little Grassbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it has put on the map Olympia and knocked out the housing construction," said SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for Kleine Grasbrook always called for an integrated planning for Olympia and a later use of housing, the CDU put on the "event factor" on one side.
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg had sparked great enthusiasm at the time.
However, Hamburg failed at Leipzig.
These are not Warhol's boxes.
Anyone who combines the terms Sweden and wooden box thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, in Sweden, fabricated wooden boxes cast dark shadows on Warhol's work directory.
Most of the forty-four Brillo boxes of the "type Stockholm" listed there are forgeries.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago raised doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes in 1968, internal research at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm now comes to a sobering conclusion: The six "Brillo boxes", which the former museum director Pontus Hultén has sold to the Moderna Museet in 1995 as a gift.
The prehistory is nested, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo Boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the paperboard cartons of the "Brillo" soap powder.
An exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968 exhibited - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: these were not from Warhol (for cost reasons) but were delivered directly from the Brillo Cartonagenfabrik.
These were not works of art, but their role models, mere exhibits.
At the same time, Warhol probably gave permission in 1968 to produce a few Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, but they were not exhibited in the Moderna Museet.
Contemporary witnesses now speak of around fifteen boxes, which at the time were rightly incorporated into the history of art and auctions as authorized original Andy Warhol Brillo boxes with the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have made more than $100,000 in auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that around a hundred wooden boxes were produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, Hultén’s 105 boxes were only produced in 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By that time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief conservator at the Moderna Museet, in addition to the six museum-owned Brillo-Boxes, has also investigated three privately owned Swedish companies, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their press-span plates were first grounded and smeared, and then white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The structure of the copies from 1990, on the other hand, reveals that the paint with a painting roller without primer was applied directly to the press clamping plate - moreover, it is not oil, but acrylic paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes," says the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve, "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to a different conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition materials."
As early as July, the Authentication Board has announced that it will investigate the “heavy allegations” made in the matter of soap powder boxes.
But since then, you have been hiding in unrelenting silence.
Rebel soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who had been hiding in a hotel in Manila demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He could not be responsible for bloodshed, said the leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and electoral fraud, reporters at the hotel.
Government-sponsored soldiers had previously stormed the hotel under tear gas use.
The approximately two dozen soldiers had been hiding in the building for hours.
Around half of them were in court on Thursday for a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly settle down with around 30 sympathizers.
The military police officers, who were supposed to guard him, apparently had run over to him and joined his mutiny.
They invaded the Peninsula hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government forces shut down the district around the prestigious hotel.
The president called an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National security adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
“People have enough,” Trillanes said.
“We call on people to join us.”
General Danilo Lim, who used to command the elite unit of the Scout Rangers, said other army units wanted to join the march soon.
Government critics have called for large demonstrations against the president for Friday.
Their government has been overshadowed by corruption allegations for months.
Manila’s financial district was already the main scene of the attempted mutiny of around 200 military members against Arroyo in 2003.
The insurgency failed after almost 24 hours in refusing to join the army.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder at Versatel
United Internet has secured a stake of more than 20 percent in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as the company announced on Wednesday evening.
They now hold 20.05 percent of the share capital.
An acquisition had previously been speculated.
The option to increase the share of versatel is kept open.
The move aims to advance the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet said.
Earlier on Wednesday, assumptions about an entry had already emerged after Berenberg Bank increased its participation in the Düsseldorf network operator by a further 5 percent to 15.1%.
The money house considers the shares only for a third party, it said in the financial market.
The previous day, United Internet had already participated in the mobile phone company Drillisch with just under 10 percent.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch has placed 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros.
5.15 million shares of which United bought the Internet for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies have recorded discussions about marketing cooperations for DSL and mobile products.
“We are strengthening our partnership,” a United Internet spokesperson said.
The two companies founded the joint venture MSP to acquire the competitor Freenet.
For the time being, the two companies want to satisfy themselves with a share of well over ten percent in Freenet and not make use of their right to acquire another 18.49 percent in Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
However, the two companies remained open to all options, in particular to further increase their participation in Freenet AG.
Discussions between United Internet and Freenet about a strategic partnership had ended in mid-November.
The poker that has been around Freenet for months and is difficult to see is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
By the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million mobile contract customers and 1.27 million DSL and complete connection customers.
The holdings of United Internet and Drillisch have so far held directly 6.01% of Freenet shares.
Now it has been agreed that Drillisch will bring in another around four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas had already been agreed in August.
