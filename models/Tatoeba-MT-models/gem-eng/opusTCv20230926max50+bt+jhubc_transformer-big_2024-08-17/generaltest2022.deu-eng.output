The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I'm a #PRS_ORG# big customer and so it's not a problem for me.
All you need is a number or instruction that I should attach to the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs $179.
To be honest, I find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel and re-order the order for the better price or is there another way of crediting?
In principle, I also think that children should not be expected to take on a parent role for their little siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Let's take a look, let's help, let's bring the bottle, etc.
In this way they learn responsibility, help the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be enough children, I see no problem.
If your K1 is working alone for a short time and it’s OK for him, that’s good.
You can decide for yourself if this is right for your children.
It is not the case that he should wrap K2 and accompany it for hours while falling asleep.
Legally, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps so is the psychologist’s statement.
Because if something should actually happen like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is, of course, your discretion ;)
Please help me find the title of a book!
I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the whole story, but I don't want the title partout anymore.
The story was about fear and treating it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal caretaker commits suicide by pouring himself in food and going to his predatory cats in the enclosure.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a brief investigation at his therapist’s office, manages a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The Commissioner has a little niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There is more suicide and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go and document the location of the suicide and put the photos on the internet before each suicide.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist operates a kind of underground therapy group where the patient is transplanted a chip that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain and ultimately the patients face their anxiety in the most extreme way.
(One woman jumps out of the window another drives to death with intent)
This fear is referred to in the book as “the fight”.
In the end, there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
This is such a rough plot I am quite sure that the book was written in the original by a French author/author.
If this action is known to anyone or even someone can tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh, I don't have the password for Wlan.
I need to contact my husband first.
But that can take time.
What steps do I have to take after that?
Is it also possible to get the price difference back?
Child, 4 j., Splitter under the thumbnail
Child, four years old, has over the entire length wood splitter under the thumbnail (outside).
I tried to pull him with a tweezers.
Very hard to grasp.
It didn’t work and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
Tomorrow we go to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
By combining digital decoder and sound module on a printed circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x 15.5mm and can therefore be installed in almost any locomotive of track sizes H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with a 11x15mm large "sugar cube" speaker as well as sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
He has mastered the DCC data format as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In the DCC format, 14 to 128 driving stages are as natural as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoder registers at a suitable digital center fully automatically.
It controls all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom®, the CV values on the main track can be read out with matching centrals.
For central banks that can only program the CVs of 1-255, there are auxiliary registers.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 driving levels at 255 addresses.
Three additional Motorola® addresses enable the triggering of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also enables reprogramming with the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic registration to mfx®-compatible central units.
The LokSound 5 decoder detects the M<0xC3><0xA4>rklin® braking distances as well as ZIMO® HLU braking commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
It is also possible to brake with DCC brake blocks or with DC voltage.
In addition, it also stops at a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC pendulum train automatic allows automatic commuting between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analog DC and AC circuits.

Because of Omikron, Johnson wants to push for resuscitation
New Omikron cases are always bringing politics and science to the UK.
By New Year, therefore, all qualifying adults in England should receive a vaccination offer.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to move ahead even faster in the face of rapid rising Omikron numbers than previously intended.
Every adult in England should be given the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his compatriots.
So far, the target date was at the end of January.
The UK government will also provide support to speed up vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In the face of the Omikron variant, people face an emergency, which is why vaccination protection needs to be strengthened urgently, Johnson said.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third vaccine dose.
"Let's boost now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1,239 more Omikron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3,137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
I'm for everyone to introduce themselves to pronouns
I sent an application.
Today the invitation came to a conversation by email.
I want to reply to the e-mail.
But unfortunately, the name is not a "Peter", but a more complicated name.
I googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
** I'm a foreigner and I don't want an official to step over my feet.
Conclusion: Everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them.
Only the one I bought today is not possible.
Obviously, the chair had an unobtrusive lack of sales.
How can such a cushion damage occur after 9 months otherwise ?
First tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
But it has been working since ca.
No more 14 days.
So I always bought the last books from the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
However, there was no more.
Now they are available again and I want you to add 2 chairs to the order and charge me this.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content warning: I will write something in detail about domestic violence here.
I just have to write something about the soul.
I (21) are more likely to come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A topic that really sucks at me and unfortunately happens far too often is that many victims can’t help or think we couldn’t help them.
I know we can’t do everything and it’s not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than if I can do nothing in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even talking under four eyes, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I can’t reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of ripping the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, is partly very close to tears, all are worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don’t just have to accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
This will never be easier.
Please, always remember that you are worth living without violence, which is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What's the point of the series on "League of Legends"?
Many fantasy, many complicated names, a stunning presentation: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the two season already announced?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle of the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on Youngster Johannes Patrick was relying.
Again, nothing: For the second time in not even three months, the giants in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick had said to Hakro Merlins Crailsheim at the beginning of October, “We still have some anger in our stomach.”
However, she did not lie down after the game - but increased again in the face of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
More than the naked result, however, disappointed the way the performance was performed.
Representing this is called a statistic that expresses the entire dilemma: The three-way ratio was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all from young Johannes Patrick) when saying and writing 31 attempts - still questions?
John Patrick replied, “We just weren’t focused enough after the victory at Tenerife and didn’t implement what we trained.”
To move the ball.
His opponent Sebastian Gleim reacted quite differently: "To win a horny game for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the lucky coach.
"It felt like 10,000 people before".
Only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they came at their expense.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and steered his team’s game.
“The best player I’ve ever coached,” Gleim said.
While in Patrick’s team, even the performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15), the giants prevented a total debacle and came up to eight points after they had already returned 39:59.
In addition to John Patrick, Justin Simon scored 12 points.
Fortunately, there is not much time to fight.
Already on Wednesday (19:00) the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I registered a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have informed ourselves legally again and have therefore written them again.
We originally signed up half a year ago.
Always as peeled out of the egg: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to inspire his audience with reinterpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on the road with the program "Good day, good luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
In fact, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing of it will happen.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - "on official instructions" to contain the Corona virus.
Other performances planned during the Advent season also have to be cancelled, as the singer’s website, which is now 59, and his musician (www.palast-orchester.de) says.
Starting in January, the artists will then want to make their appointments as early as 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has already sung a lot as a teenager.
He studied operatic singing in Berlin, and in 1986 he founded the Palace Orchestra together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established itself with its repertoire of percussionists and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has been awarded many awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached second place in the charts, just like his successful album "For Women Is This No Problem" (2013).
He made it out of the niche into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair combed back strictly and focused on etiquette, Max Raabe is no longer to be thought away from the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Good day, good luck" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa

Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz: No new apartment is created by expropriation
The new Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as was demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"With a expropriation, not a single new apartment is created, it only changes the ownership structure," Geywitz said in an interview with the "day mirror" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
A colourful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is by the way the best protection against monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and Left Party wants to set up an expert commission on how to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not relax, Geywitz did not rule out discussions with the FDP in the Ampel coalition about further tightening of the rental law.
The coalition agreement provides for a lease price brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tense housing markets and the expansion of the rent level.
I will speak with the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market still does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," the SPD politician stressed.
Hello, I wanted to order something and after a few days I noticed that I forgot the last step in the payment.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do you know when it will be available again?
Or will it ever come again?

Then I set it up on my own with the new order.
Thank you for the quick clarification!
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long will it take to ship?

At least 100 dead from tornadoes in Kentucky
With a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have been pulled by the United States.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 people could be killed.
The pictures from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
On Saturday night, several tornadoes in the United States have caused severe devastation and possibly claimed up to a hundred deaths.
The storms leave behind an approximately 320-kilometer-long snow of devastation, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Its governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area, wherever the tornado went through, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just away.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He expects up to a hundred deaths in Kentucky alone, with official numbers rising every hour.
Hello, I just saw that she's sold out showcase #NAME#.
That's very bad.
Will it still be produced?
Or is it completely removed from the range?
Is it possible to order this display case in another country?
Until when do you sign up?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I understand that, only can I order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an article via the contact form or gave up a return and wanted to ask if this was arriving or being processed, since I have not yet received confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination premiums and change advertising slogans
While the German government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccine premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and offer their employees money premiums for vaccination.
They are thus in line with the social partners <0xC3><0x96>GB and Wirtschaftskammer, which today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - according to the German model - is also intended to increase the willingness to receive Corona vaccinations.
He switched to a company he was harassing.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously didn’t sew in his old place and was looking for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you at the time: no matter what.
He didn’t like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please record the cancellation.
This will be legally relevant.

Help with your first campaign
Boron to the Grave!
For a group of 4 friends, I’m currently leading the adventure About the Gripen Pass and want to lead my heroes seamlessly into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual files are designed and now I am about to write the entry adventure and stumble on my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to bring a vehicle with grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
This is where the further action should develop.
A few miles from the village, a group of Goblins are set to ambush the heroes.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: Convince, act, threaten, recognize the danger early, whatever happens to the players.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 armed with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabres
In the case of non-remarkables, the Goblins ambush the hero in a hollow path and flank three left and right bows each arming the vehicle while two with spears stop the vehicle.
If it comes to battle and the heroes are subject to it, I have two solutions
The heroes are all found unconscious and then healed by the son of the village school, a half-elf.
The cart is gone, of course.
Should a defeat be inevitable, this half-elf with two of his servants intervenes and comes to the aid of the hero in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you think Deus ex Machina of Solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much to embark on an adventure?
The group Goblins will play a decisive role later on, so it is not just cannon feed.
EDIT: wow, I didn’t expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I will be sure to listen to many of your ideas and now I have more confidence in my narratives.
I built the lamp again.
And put together again.
Unfortunately, it still does not work.
That's why I'd love to send her back anyway
If you can send the return notes then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

I'm annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hello F1 fans, over the season the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to get a little air with this post.
First of all, today, in the middle of the F2 race, the transfer was cancelled in order to start F1 pre-reporting on time.
Although due to the delayed start and the start of the schedule was far behind the planning, one could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!) .
It seems, however, that for legal reasons, F1 takes precedence and therefore has to restrict everything else, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK has finally passed the race.
Nevertheless, a little praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then in the F1 there was again rule ignorance with the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so they both did not know that under a red flag you can change the tires.
Although there was this situation in Imola, Baku and Silverstone already this year, they both came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to change the tyres when there were corresponding radio statements on this issue to Hamilton.
At Sky UK as well as RTL, both commentators immediately knew that there is this possibility for hiding.
I think such elementary rules should be easily known when commenting on the F1 on a pay-TV channel.
It is also not the first puzzle rate, which is now possible or prescribed according to the rules, both simply have constant uncertainties on the subject of rules.
In general, Roos doesn’t like the artful comment style, but admit that it’s a matter of taste.
But I really like Heiko water from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant obscenities, both of which simply make them look unprofessional, such as ordering coffee at the (also unsuspecting) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
The latter brings a great deal of unrest in the comment, which he apparently does not take it seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the run-out round Sky is the only channel that goes into the advertising, as you can listen to at F1TV because only the German soundtrack without comment has to come out immediately after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do.
Also, these two channels in the trainings make less advertising than Sky, and that as a free TV channel.
You have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of Sky Sport F1 is also very poor and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking station to transmit the F1.
Unironically, RTL is doing a better job in the four races except for advertising, which they are still allowed to transfer.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than would be possible with a reasonable transmitter.
I would be interested in your opinion.
On the here: #PRS_ORG# pendant light, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that should be delivered last week and that still isn't being delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and nothing so far.
The First Lady told me it was sent on Monday, the second Lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an email and she never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already had a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I'm asking for support.
Fan pumps are excellent for supplying an aquarium with oxygen in addition.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifter.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
At the end of the offer, look at the table.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate entire systems with them.
If you own a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outputs are suitable for connecting multiple outflows.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, depending on the model fan pump, but also offer to set an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (find us at the shop) or with a decor that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure trove, mussel or something like that.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected by means of an air hose 4/6 mm to an out-flower or the like... and it can start already.
The fan pump should be the same, or higher than the water level and be mounted on the outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be set in between.
Simply cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent once water would run backwards, running the water out of the basin through the pump...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, you should, like other air pumps, be covered and protected from moisture
MK series pumps are pure power packs that consume little energy
Even if we specify the processing time with 3 days here in ebay, the packages are packed daily and the packages are also picked up daily here.
Everything goes well on the way, it goes very fast.
We just want to prevent a little so that no one is mistaken just because it took a little longer.
It would be like that, not everyone has an understanding of all the employees who also work in freight forwarding... of course here does not stop Corona.
Please do not rate the same bad just because the delivery is delayed, this is solely due to the parcel services.
Of course you like to complain about these services, even if we say at the moment... they have it damn hard
This is also very different regionally.
Don’t be evil to anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take the yellows to order with and without armrests?
Can you order your legs in light?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and presenter into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers have made a short trip to space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The take-off and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the U.S. state of Texas.
Under bright blue skies, Bezos personally welcomed the newly-chosen astronauts after their return.
“Welcome back,” Bezos said, dressed in a blue spacesuit as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers gradually climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were on the road for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard, who flew into space in 1961 as NASA astronauts (1923-1998), after whom the Blue Origin missile system is named, and the 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: aerospace engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur.
How much they paid for their ticket, Blue Origin did not tell.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father’s mission after the short flight.
He worked hard in his operations and had to do everything himself.
She just flew along like that, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan was also impressed.
He would like to return to space again, the moderator said.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers in height
The New Shepard missile system is largely automated.
The capsule separated from the rocket during the flight reached a height of about 100 kilometers above the Earth, sometimes with weightlessness, before the reusable object landed again, slowed down by large parachutes.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts view 100 kilometers above the Earth as a boundary with space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned all-out of Blue Origin: the first in July was Amazon founder Bezos himself on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second in October was the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world-famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and deputy chief of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of driving the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard to the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and find the subject in itself quite exciting and also standing in the laboratory does not bother me (have already the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
Of course, I also informed myself before studying about career prospects thought at the time, but also at the time, which I definitely want to study and will be until the doctorate.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially distressing the professional prospects.
On the one hand (study check, etc.) you always hear great career opportunities and the profession is totally wanted, on the other hand you always hear from unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
I would be really interested in this:
1) What are you currently working on?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/content?
3) What did you study/What training did you do?
4) Would you do it all over again?
Thank you for your reply!
I am currently really unsure and may consider canceling my studies in 2022 and making an education as a specialist computer scientist.
If you have any experience, you might also like to write it :)
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
This topic came up to me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why a post is about it now.
Not only before great holidays, such as the Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our operations.
As it seems, there are those even before holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Ascension of Mary, which is called "uphill" in Switzerland.
On Friday, the vast majority of people and businesses make a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
There was a long 4-day weekend in the house last week.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
Loud e-mails, which absolutely had to be out before the driveway, order here order there, all *unconditional* before the long weekend.
Because... yeah because?
Because "next week then" sounds after so much time and that can't be?
Or because people want to do all the serious stuff in a shortened week as much as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also greatly stimulated.
What does this self-isolation mean for holidays?
Why do we still have holidays if we can’t afford them properly?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all quite independent.
My question is simple: are we the only ones, the Swiss?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but has no gifts at all.
"The beautiful thing, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, then you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will agree to the feast by baking and crafting cookies with her son.
“I love that,” Catterfeld said.
Until the contemplative days, however, she still has a lot to do: "For the first time I don't have any presents yet, I have to start now".
NEKTON-Bio supports the smooth running of the mouse and the regeneration of the feather.
NEKTON-Bio contains all vital vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 <0xCE><0xBC>g of biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of feather damage that occurs in bird keeping is due exclusively to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage consists of protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a perfect spring dress.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Much of the animal loss that occurs during the mouse is due to a lack of or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON bio, the unfavorable ratio of the amino acids in most plant feed is explicitly considered and balanced.
During the use of NEKTON-Bio, no further vitamin preparation should be administered.
NEKTON-Bio is cold water-soluble and can easily be administered via drinking water or via soft food.
Thank you, I found it
Unfortunately, it still does not work
Klein-Handwerksmodell Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was also used in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway ME issue 11/1968, used with tracks and missing parts see photos, function good, the series E 95 is a heavy goods train electric locomotive of the German ReichsGrokomotive
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we are operationally reworked
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned the AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could carry 2,200 tonne coal trains and 530 tonne passenger trains at 45 km/h travel speed on this route.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG decided on the delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with Tatzlager drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the company numbers E 95 01–06.
They all survived the Second World War and then found themselves in the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives arrived in the Soviet Union as repair goods.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the Reichsbahnbehörtungswerk Dessau, the workability of all six locomotives was established.
[4] With the progressive re-electrification of the Central German network, there was an increasing demand for locomotives for heavy goods train service, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were worked up in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts dispensers.
The E 04, E 44 and E 94 which are present in larger quantities were first preferably constructed.
Only when it was foreseeable at E 94 that the work-up number could not be further increased did the E 95 move into the point of view of the work-up.
[4] Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway station.
They came to the Halle P railway station in 1960.
They were mostly used in a separate circulation plan in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complicated control of the locomotives proved problematic with increasing age.
Thus, it was often the case that shooters remained stuck during switching operations.
Then the Beimann, who was constantly driving along on this locomotive, with a hammer and a wooden wedge, had to solve the shooters again during the ride.
Damage to the driving engines was common and resulted in months of failure at the locomotive.
[5] Since there were enough new construction locomotives at the end of the 1960s, and a significant expansion of the electric operation was not planned at the time, the Reichsbahn was able to dispense with old locomotives and most of the splitter genres, leaving the E 95 out of service.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to occupy electric locomotives only one-man, which would have caused a problem in train operation due to the mentioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility conditions of the driver’s position.
[5] After the closure of E 95 02 and E 95 03 in mid-1969, they were the last to follow E 95 01, which quit the service on 5 October 1970.
The new designation 255 001 was thus never used.
Except for the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a switch heating system at Halle Central Station.
It took some time for those in charge of the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 was worthy of preservation as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the first external reprocessing of the locomotive began with the aim of being able to present it to a vehicle show at RAW Dessau.
[5] It has since belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operating museum locomotive.
In 1986, the internal completion of the locomotives was carried out.
At the DB Museum Halle (Saale) the locomotive museum is supervised.
Since 1995, employees of the traditional community Bw Halle P have been working on the operational reprocessing of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time for an exhibition at the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new interior and exterior paintwork, with the transformers being checked and five driving motors operational.
-The locomotives were in use on the Silesian mountain railway and the branching side sections until 1945, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and the low maintenance effort.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig to become the Central German network.
The main area of operation was initially Silesia
Handwork model H0 in OVP, function good, optical rework at the locomotive is necessary in own work, dusted, with traces of play, cellar smell !!!, very rare handwork model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging can have labels and traces of storage.
Yes, the F-parts are
I got a bed from you.
However, there were problems with a part.
The middle beam is held by two feet.. Unfortunately, these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I can't build the bed.
The center bar is held by two feet, these are unfortunately incorrectly produced.
The center bar does not fit into the intended holder.
So I get new ones sent.
When will they be sent off?
No, not flat.
These are, according to the assembly instructions, the right of the shape, they were only too narrow
But it doesn't matter.
The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose.
With me they are not flat
Could I get these sent?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
Residential fire with two light-damaged and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro area was caused, as the police said on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residence in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech County).
Two residents were hospitalized on Sunday with mild smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not assume a deliberate fire.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigation.
But it will come much later.
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To refute fake news - Biontech CEO releases vaccine photo
U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin published on the social network "LinkedIn" a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021
Biontech chief U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin had not yet publicly expressed his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his corona vaccination.
A friend’s illness moved him, <0xC5><0x9E>ahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz company Biontech, U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin, has published a photo showing how he receives a vaccine against the coronavirus.
On social media, there was false information that I was allegedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," <0xC5><0x9E>ahin wrote in a post on the network "LinkedIn".
"For a few months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of me on which I am being vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far, he has refused because communication should not revolve around him.
But a call last week changed his mind: “I was deeply saddened when I learned that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He fights a severe Covid-19 disease and has been hanging on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, <0xC5><0x9E>ahin continued.
He did not ask for the reasons.
"However, the most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear can be difficult to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
On the Internet, an interview with Deutsche Welle circulates, in which U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin says he was not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"I am currently not legally allowed to get the vaccine myself," <0xC5><0x9E>ahin said at the time.
There is a prioritization in Germany in the vaccination of the vaccine.
In the meantime, priority has been lifted for a long time – and the Biontech boss has been vaccinated three times, according to their own data.
Fire in substation: tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia the light went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases no heating.
A fire had paralyzed a substation.
After a fire with severe damage in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia have had to live without electricity for around 24 hours.
On Friday evening, 41,000 affected residents in several communities went out of their lights.
The supplier Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency power units had been in operation until the large-scale disturbance could finally be completely fixed in the late evening.
Firefighters and helpers of the THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered care places in schools and called for neighborhood help.
The provider thanked the victims for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigades and the THW for their tireless use,” said Florian Witt, head of the primary technology division, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few more days, as the Westnetz-Monteurs were initially only able to put some lines back into operation on a provisional basis, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire, according to company data.
Electricity is flowing again
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out on Friday at around 7:15 p.m. severely damaged parts of the 10,000 volt switchgear at the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
It requires extensive cleaning and repair work.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000 volt voltage level was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday 6 p.m., more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth would have had electricity again.
A further 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually switched on from 9.30 p.m. onwards.
Since 11.15 p.m., the last electricity affected by the failure was also available.
More than 80 installers from Westnetz and partner companies were in operation.
After the construction of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities had also called for neighbourhood assistance.
"It is important now that citizens take care of elderly or single people in their neighborhood and report to the local fire department buildings when help is needed," said Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
The focus was on setting up and operating emergency power units, especially the residents of Altenheimen.
In addition, according to authorities, temporary care places were set up in schools for those people who were unable to take care of themselves or who need power-dependent medical devices or who are dependent on medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay them in Euros?
It is the daily blanket #PRS_ORG# in blue green.
I hope you have a nice day too and please stay healthy <0xE2><0x99><0xA1>
But I can't mount the base on the table top.
This is Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of this.
We wanted those with table tops diameter of #NUMBER#
we got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't push it into one another and thus shorten it.
Can you help me further?
Otherwise I would have to send her back, because otherwise she is not suitable for the purpose.
I would be happy to receive a feedback
Yes, this is really easier!
Then we'll do it like that!
Will you send me the return note by e-mail?
The repair is now complete.
I tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do this now?
I find such a low credit almost inconceivable.
We do not agree with this

When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we have both made new s and use the version 4.5...
You may have heard of problems many times.
I bought directly with my #PRS_ORG#, a book it seems to be on too.
As soon as I want to open it comes the message, ups!
This document could not be opened.
File may be incorrectly reported to customer service.
As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can they help me?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I also have to work in the meantime!
To make the paint application even and clean, clean the components with some soapy water from dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry.
Before putting the brush on the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later invisible inside of the components or on a yoghurt cup.
The first line on the component
Pull the brush evenly next to the stroke.
Light overlap of the color layers later ensures a uniform surface.
Avoid wiping quickly back and forth with the brush.
This creates unrealistically effective surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
Otherwise, the dark ones might shine through later on.
Metal tones and metallic colors come to the end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can lead to unsightly metal slips when mixed with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before mooring them.
The models achieve true-to-life appearance through the decals or decals.
From emblems on airplanes to ship names to trims and car models: the decals give the model the final touch.
Place the decals in the correct order as long as the components are still easy to reach.
An aircraft cockpit can be glued or more easily before it is installed in the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tool such as scissors, tweezers and toothpicks are when pasting time, patience and a quiet hand.
Cut each required decal individually and put it right for you.
Decals are also called water slide pictures because you briefly moisten their back with water until the carrier paper gets dark through the wet.
Then you just slide the picture a small piece of paper and place the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you also moistened before).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, pull the carrier paper away laterally.
Attention: Always check whether the image is sitting correctly before you slide it completely off the paper so that it does not stick to the finger, crease or even tear.
Extract excess water with a household cloth.
Not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book for a short time as soon as I look for something else then I no longer read the book and have to unsubscribe and log in and reload the book and look for the place to where I have read.
I have already communicated with you on Saturday.
Can I get it by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
The lamp came to me in three packages.
ok but thank you very much!
Then I will buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
Can I get it back without any problems?
PKV / What is a "Insurance Case"?
Hello together,
we were in childcare for some time, now when it comes to billing with the PKV, this suddenly turns across.
In the series:
We had applied for the children's railway in advance at the PKV and received the promise of 3 attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and birth and was settled with the PKV.
Some time later we tried to have a second child, and carried out 2 (successless) attempts, but these did not yet calculate with the PKV.
We again applied for the cost takeover at the PKV and received 3 further attempts.
After a few further attempts (we have done more trials than promised, logically the most expensive ones are calculated with the PKV) we submitted the invoices to the PKV and got the bad surprise: instead of 5 trials (2+3) the PKV wants to refund only 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first commitment expire.
The second child's wish is a new insurance case.
However, according to the General Terms and Conditions, "The insurance case begins with the treatment, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is entitled here to refund the PKV (only 3 attempts) or we (there are 5 attempts to refund)?
* Would the PKV have had to point out to us in the promises that with one birth the further attempts would have expired?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (due to closed fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give your opinion.
Thank you so much for your help!
Please send me the three variants by email and tell me how to reach them again
All right.
We won't order anything from you anymore.
If they add the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they have obviously lost good customer.
You are welcome to pass this on to your manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, the colleague told me that the repayment was initiated and now tell me that I have to send the thing back.
I don't think I can do anything to make the dresser come to me completely disturbed.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague has written
It is clear that the refund has been initiated and I still have not received a refund via #PRS_ORG#
You can adjust to your manager that you have now lost two regular customers.
My friend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We will no longer do that.
No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they may not sell it as an office chair.
Regardless of this, the warranty of 24 months applies.
No, it is not possible for me to purchase a different type of packaging.
I will be able to dismantle the cabinet and make it available to the transport company in this way.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional stools to be purchased, but unfortunately we can not find them with you.
Can they help?
Topic of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
What exactly a low-budget film is, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the net you can find plenty of lists of low-budget movies, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What are you excited about?
And what do you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of you, have already set up 2 apartments complete with your furniture.
Wanted to ask for the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is it now also reliable?
Thank you!
With kind regards
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30min is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes about the waiting position...I'll give up again soon because it just doesn't work here.
Hello!
Half victory against Belarus linked to high costs for the EU
The EU, in conflict with the Belarusian regime, can, according to political expert Raphael Bossong, announce a "half victory".
The costs, however, were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at Belarus’ border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not resolved the confrontation sustainably, the researcher of the Berlin Science and Politics Foundation (SWP) explained.
This state of gravity - Belarus does not admit very little, but the EU feels like a winner - is likely to go on for a while.
Dealing with people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
Apparently there is an “increasing normalization of pushbacks” by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole does not resolutely oppose this, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
At the same time, this development weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It seems that it cannot prevail if a Member State sets out to do its thing," Poland said, which does not even allow access to the border by the EU Border Protection Agency Frontex.
In addition, the EU is paying another price for its policy at the border with Belarus, Bossong says: A basic agreement on asylum policy will be made more difficult, as the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Another attempt at crossing the border
According to Poland’s border guards, migrants have once again tried to reach Poland via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested at night on Sunday and returned to the border, a spokeswoman for the agency said on Sunday.
The Polish officials were stone-thrown in the incident near the town of Czeremsza by the migrants.
According to reports, a soldier was hit on the face and had to be medically cared for by a military doctor.
In total, the border guard 52 registered attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko as a powerhouse in Minsk of attracting them with the prospect of entering the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania cancelled border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines bringing migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners travelled to people’s countries of origin to prevent departures there.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on airlines, Bossong said.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with harsh bans and extraterritorial sanctions".
Minsk must also take into account domestic policy costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the security apparatus to regularly drag thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes Protests After Controversial Formula 1 Final
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen has committed two rule breaks during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale of Abu Dhabi, Mercedes filed an objection.
The silver arrows suggest two breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to an alleged violation of Max Verstappen in the Red Bull during the last safety car phase, when he is said to have been irregularly overtaken.
A second opposition was filed against the score at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and was in his first Formula 1 title.
The manoeuvre took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, in which the Dutchman had overtaken driving cars in front of him.
I'll check it out.
I'll talk to the bank and get back to you
thanks for the support
Free entry for members: Europa-Park organises SC-Freiburg-Fantag
The Europa-Park, the name given to the Europa-Park stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fantag.
As the park announces, members and permanent cardholders of the sports club from Breisgau as well as members of the fan community were allowed to visit the Europa-Park free of charge on this day.
In addition, there were also vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster trains lit red and white through the jerseys that day.
Foxes, Ed Euromaus and many red-and-white balloons created the perfect backdrop," the park said.
Since the early 1990s, there has been a cooperation between the Bundesligisten and the amusement park located in Rust, 40 kilometres north of Freiburg.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in Europa-Park, we have once again shown how well the partnership fits.
Seeing brilliant fans having fun together in the roller coaster confirms this,” says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is it €#number# and not as originally €1699?
Stages in the career of the new world champion Verstappen
The Dutchman Max Verstappen is the new world champion of Formula 1.
Max Verstappen did it.
The Dutchman wins his first World Cup title at the Red Bull in his seventh year in Formula 1.
His way to the top of the King's class:
Abu Dhabi - 2012, Italy: Passing away after a crash in Sarno plays the Kart World Championship.
Father Jos Verstappen leaves him on his return journey angry at a gas station.
His mother Sophie Kumpen picks up the teenager in the car.
2014, England: Red Bull’s junior team gets promising offspring in disguise.
The 16-year-old is walking in the footsteps of Sebastian Vettel and Daniel Ricciardo.
At the time, he continued in European Formula 3.
2015, Australia: Verstappen starts at the age of 17 and 166 days as the youngest pilot in history in a Grand Prix.
Due to a defect, he must abandon his Toro Rosso in Melbourne prematurely.
2015, Malaysia: At the age of 17 and 180 days, the then Toro Rosso pilot Verstappen is also the youngest racer to score 1 points in Formula One.
Verstappen occupies seventh place in Sepang at the Grand Prix of Malaysia.
2016, Spain: In his first race for Red Bull, Verstappen wins the same.
At the age of 18 and 228 days in Barcelona, he will be sensationally the youngest Grand Prix winner in Formula 1 history.
2019, Hungary: Verstappen celebrates his pole premiere in Budapest - he is not the youngest.
At the age of 21, he leaves Valtteri Bottas and his Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton behind.
2021, Abu Dhabi: The summit has been reached.
At the age of 24, Verstappen celebrates his first World Cup title at the Formula 1 final in Abu Dhabi – with an overtaking maneuver against Hamilton in the final round.
I already had a huge trouble with you when I ordered the #PRS_ORG# dresser.
Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord", author Judith Hermann read on Friday in the sold-out Blue Note from her current novel "Daheim" and also acted as a presenter.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the nightly noises at her front door.
I gave up the contact form yesterday to return an article, but did not receive an email confirmation or the like.
My question is whether my question has been answered.
It doesn’t have everyone the time for your clumsy chat and misdelivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake, which you fix and not all of our household.
Contact Ms. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day
We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs #NAME# will receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a new order of the #PRS_ORG# bedside table and a return label.
This e-mail has not yet arrived.
The package still wants to get to #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me
With kind regards

I'm sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
That's like saying an eagle has nothing against foreigners.
Both of you will not admit it.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces any anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself then you should just leave it complete.
You are not as serious as your colleague.
Those who seriously question evolution in principle are simply completely lost.
For my part, a God has set all things in motion.
But once you are a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and science is only squandering nonsense.
And with that, you are an enemy of science and no longer to take seriously as a colleague
In order to obtain an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be approached as close to the eye as possible.
The specially aplanatically-achromatically designed lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass in a practically index-free and colour-free way up to the edge zone.
Lups are often marked with magnification information.
However, this information only applies to precisely defined conditions, which rarely meet the conditions of use.
In order to make the most of your magnifying glass, please note the instructions in the "Technical data" table (see instructions for use in the packaging).
On the lens surfaces of all optical devices – i.e. even in the case of impact loops – light reflections arise.
An anti-reflective coating significantly reduces these reflections.
In compliance with optimal conditions of use - magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less perceptible.
Further information can be found in the enclosed instructions for use (available in German and English).

Tannenverkauf in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women are looking for Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced so many curious situations in the sale of fir trees.
Once a man was even driven home without his partner, because they both couldn’t agree.
Every year he plants more than 2,000 pieces.
The 56-year-old has already experienced so many curious situations.
That always makes the pre-Christmas season a little fun, he says.
What about the voucher??
Have I left as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need to have discussions here about the better court, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating skewer.
Both have their names.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "driver", which by far doesn't sound so delicious.
Problems with fiberglass + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have trouble building a stable wifi network.
Previously I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and broadcast 50 Mbit perfectly until a few failures.
The new fiber optic connector sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, also arrives.
However, on the other DLan module, which emits the Wifi, the more the full 500 does not arrive, but the further I remove myself in the house with the module, the less arrives (i.e. use a socket that is located 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
As a result, the internet with the new fiber optic connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (<0x5C><0x7E>45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
Although this was slightly better than the DLan, there were similarly large losses here as well.
Could someone explain to me why using fiberglass is "lost" so much internet speed over the power line?
Is LAN really the solution?
It would be extremely expensive to install LAN cables in the house.
I’m really confused as to why I created an account here.
That is why I would be even more pleased with an answer.
When it's time to change the checking account
Who would have thought that now would be the first time rest with the giro accounts, is mistaken.
While many banks have used autumn to get their customers to confirm the fees increases of the past with all sorts of tricks, the free amounts for negative interest continue to fall.
For example, Deutsche Bank, with a limit of 100,000 euros, was considered relatively generous for a long time.
Now she has just halved the allowance and even quartered for the daily allowance.
In a first step, the limit was reduced only for customers of the Postbank Group division – to 50,000 euros for giro and investment accounts and to 25 .000 euros for daily money accounts.
However, these lower set-offs now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed on request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
Commerzbank had previously gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as well as at ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the free amounts in two stages, initially to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, more than 100 banks now have an exemption of 25,000 euros or less, according to figures from the internet portal Verivox.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: however, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which in the first instance before the Landgericht Berlin have even got right against this regulation.
Now it is already being discussed in the banks whether the institutions should form provisions - in the event that the upper authorities also declare the negative interest rates in principle inadmissible and many millions have to be repaid to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
Their lives are like a mountain and a valley.
Jennifer Aniston, 52, was voted the most influential woman of the year by the Hollywood Reporter.
For those who made a big impact in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
An entire army of assistants, stylists and trainers takes care of their appearance.
After all, according to Aniston, she gives herself a chip a day (yes, correctly read: a UNIQUE chip from the bag).
The fact that you still fly the hearts of the female and male fans alike is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she's just having bad luck with happiness - and still looking for great love.
And removed the baby's wish from the list.
Before that, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what is going on with me personally, medically, why I can’t.
It was really hurtful.
Let us hope that success and fame will also make us happy.
Unworthy end of a career: R<0xC3><0xA4>ikkönen must give up
Kimi R<0xC3><0xA4>ikkönen’s departure from Formula One went even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn pulled out his gloves and wiped his sweat off his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight tire contact, R<0xC3><0xA4>ikkönen had to cancel his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after not even half of the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ending his career in the motorsport royal class.
His wife Minttu and the two children had also travelled to the United Arab Emirates.
R<0xC3><0xA4>ikkönen’s biggest success was winning the 2007 World Championship at Ferrari.
He scored 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from the pole and came on the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup - Nolte wins in the doubles - Sport
The brand of Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bob pilot.
“I figured this out, I would have to win nine and a half victories per season, then I could make it to Cortina in 2026,” said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberb<0xC3><0xA4>renburg, who recorded two successes in two days at the Winterberg races.
First, on Saturday, he repelled Johannes Lochner's attack by five hundredths, in which he drove from rank three to one.
Then he changed something at the material setting and made a bigger head start on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberb<0xC3><0xA4>renburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he prevailed in front of the British Brad Hall.
The third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We have gone higher risk today and have been rewarded," said Friedrich, who also introduced his 22nd victory in series.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who was driving for Stuttgart, came in fifth place after second place this time before.
Christoph Hafer of BC Bad Feilnbach finished eighth in the first race after fourth place.
“If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it that way,” Lochner said.
Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamanka
With the women, Laura Nolte won the third season in the doubles on her home track.
After only reaching fourth place in the monobob the day before, she raced for the World Cup victory at the German triple victory with pusher Deborah Levi on Sunday.
Two-time Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia came second with Germany’s fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she booked the first podium spot this winter.
The Wiesbaden woman Kim Kalicki landed in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was super cool, first podium in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama takes me with her.
I am super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," Burghardt said, emphasizing: "It is not only pushing, but there is also a lot to do about it".
Jamanka was a little annoyed by the not-so-perfect rides, but said, "It's going in the right direction".
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I just didn’t get it and therefore can’t redeem why I finally asked.
Due to Corona I had quite different problems last year and never time for it.
And now it was said that he had expired, which upset me very much.
Look at the chat it was about the Asare seat.
I would like to return it and then order again, as it is just reduced :)
Why is the shipment only started on 16.3.?
There was nothing of such a long delivery time on your website
No until I tap on it comes an extra field with the message
She was taken from her colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today
I also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged
And don't cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello dear great girls and girls and women,
I have a lot of things I just want to write and maybe it's one or the other...
I am 24, I have kPTBS, full-time student and dog mom - sometimes apart from my dog not screaming or going to kindergarten he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is ill, has gotten a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we have had a lot of cuddled and it was nice.
I helped him with the shower (because hand is in the bandage wg burning).
He is also cooled and we are currently seeing less (1-2x week) which makes me very much create with my needs for affection and love.
My dog child just has stomach ache, I cooked for him and now he lies in his cuddle blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and caressing for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just gone for a month.
Now we also have housework, which we naturally divide up.
But even cooking is just a lot of work for me...
My PTSD disease is just quite well adjusted, I am halfway well treated and come to terms with it.
Not good, but I'm almost symptom-free.
My university just demands a lot (for me), tomorrow at 15h I have a written test for which I have not done anything yet and the day after tomorrow anatomy class for which I should at least prepare something.
And next week I have an oral exam right on Tuesday, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no place anymore.
So my week goes like this: Only until the day after tomorrow, then is the weekend.
But then the whole thing goes on?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holiday.
Only until the weekend.
Thank you for...
And so it continues forever.
I think I’m just so stressed out that I need these mental clues because otherwise I’ll pack that ned.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but otherwise I can't do it...
Is that how you are?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Thank you so much, I can’t put that into words.
I don’t know if I would have survived my kptbs.
I think this also has a lot to do with Mental Load of women and that's why I thought I'd find companions here...
I wish you a restful evening, the week is almost over!
I got my order today unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has imprint.
At the first delivery, the color was exactly like on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now I get a different color or how?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
For the rest, twice.
But it was not confirmed.
I found at school that many religious teachers do not believe in God and it is just another subject for them, such as math or earth science.
For me it was always a bit strange, maybe also because I was raised Christian and so I always believed somehow.
How do you feel about that?
You may also be able to tell about work and/or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But it is also strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes you want to teach religion if you don’t believe it?
True culture or something?
I hope the question is not too private.
Can't change it or not?Please write English that I understand well
It's been a long time, then I'd refrain from
It's good, thank you.
I expect a response early next week, no later than the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film Search Please help
Hello, dear people,
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it was a movie for young people.
In the film there are two timelines (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I can’t describe it in more detail in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from the curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and an action takes place.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm in order to live for herself, I mean.
The transition is also the soldier’s grave.
In the end, I believe both soldiers are fighting each other.
If that says anything to you, I am grateful for every answer.
Our little one slept only on his stomach from week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
Such a child lasts much more than you think.
Make sure everything is right, no cuddle animals, go in more times and watch, but no minutes of monitoring.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Achso and ours did not have a sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Watch your child when he sleeps.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Is it possible to get something out of your stomach?
Or is it with the face in front of the mattress?
You can tell if everything is okay.
We all grew up, and when my husband came into the world, it was eg gang and there was that you put the kids on your stomach to sleep.
In addition, we are already "customer" with you and have already bought a lot of products
But why do you offer me only 20EUR?
Hello, I wrote yesterday with a colleague of yours and so far no feedback.
It's about my wardrobe, which arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the closet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is currently not to be used.
To say it clearly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know, not everything can be kept.
And I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
Only it is simply that the policy of this broadcaster is now under the control of all.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It has been said that you are an “independent” Internet broadcaster.
Quote Arno: You don't want to be "a running litfa<0xC3><0x9F>spille".
What are you doing now?
An 0815 advertising channel that tries to bring its BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then there's Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Of course, they apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can still offend people.
A Krogman who lacks empathy completely and tries to make ashes at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms.
How do you feel about all this?
Great if you like it, I think it's terrible.
I ask for a call back as my delivered wooden table has been delivered defective.

Whether as a comforter for stomach ache or just for cuddling – My little warmth friend can be used in a variety of ways.
Cherry seeds cushions are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry seeds can absorb heat very well and release it in a dosed manner.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant for the little ones to feel comfortable, even if they are not doing well.
The Kirschkern pillow with cover is suitable as a heat application only for the following application areas:
Before heating the pillow, check for unusual odor, stick or fire stains and immediately dispose of them if present.
Please take the inner cushion out of the cover before warming it up!
Heat in the microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (note the microwave manufacturer's information!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the cushion by shaking!
Then place the inner cushion in the cover.
In the first heats, a slight moisture formation can occur on the surface, but it disappears in repeated applications.
Be sure to adhere to the heating instructions provided, as longer periods or higher energy outputs can lead to damage (inflammation and combustion hazard!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that a heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions for use.
After the heated inner cushion has been put back into the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion for baby's suitability (max. 43 °C) at your elbow!
Do not use the pillow in acute and chronic, inflammatory or fever-like conditions, circulatory problems, fresh hematomas, bruising and open wounds, as well as in people with reduced pain.
For existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumor diseases as well as pregnancy, please contact a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose cores are released, dispose of the product and the loose cores immediately and inaccessible to children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year of age, the temperature of the child should be checked regularly during the application to exclude overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product shall be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and washable at 30°C in the machine.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt after Hinserie Zweiter - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf

Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged through my power supply.
I bought this again about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the power supply alone was enough to operate.
The battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite plugged in power supply.
Then I removed the battery, but there is nothing going on here.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in network mode?
Is something else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
I don't know how high the seat is...
Often on tour and still a lot of equipment?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design no problem!
20 litres of capacity also swallow larger photo equipment without problems, which can be safely stored using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And what else you need in everyday objects, thanks to practical accesses in the individually configurable interior, remains well organized and separable from the photo equipment.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design has it all in itself - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing access to photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two options: once conventionally via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven itself with the Messenger Bags.
In this case, there is a metal closure hook in the closure flap with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered various "fill levels": there are 4 anchor bars, stably riveted, into which the hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, just take the top bar, it is rather empty, a deeper one.
The flap closure and hooks are also magnetic.
Thus, the backpack can also be reliably closed without snapping the hook.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from above - you don't have to worry about the content anymore!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the everyday suitability of the backpack enormously: if you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can configure the interior individually (more below) to store both of them separately without any problems - and access them independently through the two side openings.
So you can also pull the backpack from the right side in front of the body, for example, to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday things stay safe in the left backpack half and do not get in between.
Comfortable, easy-to-adjust carrying straps help with this.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the content remains dry even if it is to go to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I am waiting in vain for the email from her support.
#NAME# gave me an email yesterday from confirmation for the commission of the
Contact by the forwarder announced to pick up the incorrectly delivered table.
So far I have not received any messages.
I'm asking for immediate settlement.
I am already writing with the third support employee, with no one I came beyond the promise that I will receive an email as confirmation.
It is the return of the wrongly delivered Custom #NAME#
It is worth noting when the cabinet could be delivered again?
Keeping it that way is not an option for me...
It works.
Thank you very much for the help

Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was supplied with a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher to me, I will immediately place a larger order, but after all I have kept the damaged piece of furniture and not sent it back.
And that the past year was different than I thought, I couldn’t guess and just couldn’t redeem it in time and clarify it.
But I have the damage as a customer and I do not accept that.
Rotinger brake discs are designed to meet the demands of the dynamic driver, who appreciates reliability and safety when braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of cast and then mechanically machined (drilled and cut).
All tinted discs are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are suitable for specific discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which depends on the properties of the original assembly with the balancing of the disk.
The tinted discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
Additionally created openings increase the efficiency of cooling the disc, with the cut-outs improving the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic properties of our tinted discs underline the character of each car through attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man at the southern fork of the American River discovered glowing chunks in the water.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called California Gold Rush of ’49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest-growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were fenced off, tents pitched, and saloons and hotels emerged almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country’s wealth.
For many, it was called "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)!
In this game you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You will look for gold, recruit workers, drive horses together and build businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjoining areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to surpass your pioneer colleagues so as not to mess with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
You simultaneously choose your actions, have to keep your resources at home and build a tableau that is more and more "working" for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, receive additional actions or apply rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playing style with fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which the gold was discovered in Coloma), over 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) until 1850 (the year in which California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly select a location on the game plan where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a site has the most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This disables one-half of the site - reducing the possible actions there.
Then players alternate actions, such as winning resources, moving cars, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning gun heroes.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
At the beginning of each round, the claimant turns to a new location and thus changes the available actions.
This continues until the claimant has moved five times, so each location has once been covered and the year ends.
There is a shooting in which players have to defend Coloma from an assault of angry bandits.
If players have contributed enough gun heroes and are numerically superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive lower rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final score is taken.
The player with the most points wins!

"Why children are not tyrants" Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I just watched it.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff likes to be seen in talk shows and gives lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why our children become tyrants" (2008), he sparked a fierce educational debate.
Former patients: women and legal guardians now make serious accusations against him.
Please be careful, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Our parents and other responsible persons must never, ever, ever go for power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child free space for his development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is sensible and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.

At their next meeting, the health ministers of the countries want to decide on a nationwide waiver of the test obligation for three-fold vaccines.
"We countries urgently need clarity as to whether and when vaccinations can be dispensed with for three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Minister's Conference, the "Image on Sunday".
The elimination of 2G plus for triple vaccines is "not only medically meaningful, but also provides an additional vaccine incentive," Holetschek said.
Federal Minister of Health Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised that "he will make a proposal to the Health Minister's Conference on this as early as next Tuesday".
So I want to send the lamp back
What do I do best?
Hello, I like the #PRS_ORG# chair, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer make purchases through my #PRS_ORG#.
Display: Ups, an error has occurred.
Shopping via the #PRS_ORG# page at the computer.
I have updated my account details.
What could this be?
What you describe is called *Awareness*, i.e. sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 to 1000.
Most often it comes to hearing sounds/voices, less often to see pictures and, most rarely, to perceive pain.
For this topic relevant: cesarean sections are operations that are associated with an increased rate of awareness, since a very deep anesthesia is avoided to protect the child until the anaesthesia.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned in the anesthetics preliminary discussion.
Certain anesthesia procedures, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Love everyone, this comment from me describes Awareness correctly, but** u/Nitemarex **by definition had none.
I misread your comment.
The chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the $20 won’t help either.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be that they take back the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also the standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check again if you are at least taking back the defective chair.
We then sell the second chair privately.
We also lose a lot of money.
I already sent you an email that you did not reply to.
Again the question.
In the order and on the invoice it is stated that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The forwarder is company #NAME#.
I called right there.
I was told that they only deliver on the doorstep - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order, as I do not know a person who can carry the heavy furniture on the first floor.
Am I not called?
I had formulated a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle died at the age of 97
He has profiled himself as a theatre critic and as an intendant.
He later wrote a monumental theatre story.
Günther Rühle died on Friday at the age of 97.
There's the new book on the table, press-fresh: "An old man is getting older".
The shocking diarium of a slow farewell to the world that the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle led until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book is, "I've already witnessed my life's thanks here."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are European pallets, standardized wooden pallets, which are mainly used as cargo carriers in Europe.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
In 2020, more than ten million pallets were produced in Austria, according to statistics from Austria.
The production value stood at just over EUR 79 million.
How many pallets are imported to Austria annually is not collected
New York to win MLS Championship for the first time
New York City FC won the title in Major League Soccer for the first time.
After the 1:1 in the regular season against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference decided the final in penalty shootout with 4:2.
In the Eastern Conference final, New York had prevailed against Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I got a lot of great tips for the perfect gulasch a week ago.
It was Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
Thanks again for that :)
Now I’ve come to the taste and want to cook roulades for the first time at New Year’s Eve.
Tomorrow I will start a cattle fund.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I do not have an oven, but only a large pot.
What's going on?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not so good anymore, but I get it
IIt's about a refund of €#Number#
I was already informed by email on 18.01. that the refund was made.
So far, the money has not been received by me.
Would you please check there.
Where there are still Christmas roasts in the Lübeck area
For many people, goose or duck is one of the Christmas days such as the fir tree and the gifts.
You haven't got any poultry yet?
Now time is running out.
We will tell you where you can get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube end stage contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controller, you can set the desired level on the one hand and on the other hand the zerr content of your sounds on the other.
Furthermore, the VT+ Series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller that allows you to reduce the sound level without changing anything on the "gain" and distortion.
The POWER LEVEL controller even allows you to float a power reserve when it goes unashamedly loud.
Thanks to POWER LEVEL controllers, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal applied here is processed with a box simulation, so that you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression even when using a headphone or during direct recordings.
The AUX jack can be connected to a CD or MP3 player, so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you do not need a separate tuner.
If you also donate a VFS5 foot button, you can also comfortably call the sounds by foot, turn on/off the effect blocks and "tap" the tempo of the corresponding compatible effects.
For the live bet, this is actually indispensable.
With its new power packs, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But I had seen it that way with others.
Is it possible to send the lamp back?
Because it's too low for over a dining table?
So I'd like to send her back.
Can you help me with this?
What about the dresser?
Will we receive an update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If it is not possible, I would also be satisfied with a discount or voucher.
I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods that I don’t need is a lot.
I just received my delivery and would have liked to know if screws were intended as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the provided hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time is not worth it.
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in nuclear deal negotiations
The negotiations on a revival of the international nuclear agreement show progress, according to Iranian figures.
"Both sides are about to agree on the issues to be on the agenda," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri said on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development", because at first there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on the revitalization of the agreement had continued after barely a week of interruption.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia will take part in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also on site in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now federal state with highest corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
As the only federal state, the value is above the 1000 mark.
Thuringia is the only federal state to have over 1000 marks at the Corona Incidence on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had last always shown the highest incidence nationwide, this value was on Sunday at 990.5.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had decreased slightly, but had also exceeded the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections were reported within one day with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 other deaths associated with an infection.
200 people with COVID-19 were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
On weekends, there may be delays.
In addition, the health offices have been overloaded for weeks and hardly come after with the detection of new cases.
I understand that.
Since delivery only takes place at the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print this out and stick it to the package and post it to the post office, wasn't it?
I don't have to click/enter/fill in anything else?
This is exactly what I want to avoid, which is why I am writing to you.
I would like to accept the return at my own expense.
8 euros return fee is a rudeness in my eyes.
It's time for change
##MBundesdag I'm very happy, I'm u/StratorDE in the plenary room in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
What's the post here?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the Monday, you can see one thing: it is not existing.
We got into a winter star and extended the summer hole to a few months.
#Where is the problem?
Yeah, what did it lie about?
For the most part, this should simply be related to dissatisfaction, how some things have ended here and how we generally stand.
In the last few days, the impression has become increasingly clear that many people here still have Bock on the Mmundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundesdag is in demand, who wants to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in the last few days and has found a, simply put, shear pile.
After some writing back and forth, several people from the community have found themselves wanting to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to expressly call on everyone to participate, only in this way can this project continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server, on which we can exchange each other, as well as work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How will the Mmundestag work in the future?
* Which existing orders need to be changed/adapted/removed?
* How should we act outside in the future?
* How to apply for new members?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I’m pretty sure I’ve forgotten a lot, but that’s not bad, so we’ll end up with the discord.
If you have pleasure and time, come to the Discord, work with us and let us decide democratically about the future.
I ordered a lampshade from you that will still be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too large/column for this and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered a different suspension from you.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: the daily ceiling #PRS_ORG#, are there also in excess size, so in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet will be picked up in a timely manner.
And I'm asking you to do that now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but will remove the cabinet as far as possible for the collection - they have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can work then.
#PRS_ORG# may contact me at any time by phone to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there a guide for assembly?
How long would I have time to get them or decide to return them?
How do you answer the question of why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself has lived vegetarian for a while, currently also eats meat very rarely.
I myself was a vegetarian a few years ago.
When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan and vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
And that I thought for a long time that as a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that I would ultimately also support animal cruelty.
So I decided to become a vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that she felt disgust on her part, she then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and was reduced to animal suffering as a vegetarian.
Now I wonder if my answer was “plimp”?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that you as a vegan are quickly put into a corner and conflicts arise without putting it on.
It greets a harmony-loving vegan (;
It is clearly not an exception under <0xC2><0xA7> 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# will not release you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am on the assigned date on which #PRS_ORG# does not pick up my returns on site.
Since I can't be on site because of a funeral, unfortunately this can't be changed.
Can I be assigned an alternative pick-up date?
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I am constantly coming back.
Lahnsteiner Wehr prepared for water rescue: 45,000 euros grant from the country
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate interior minister Roger Lewentz presented a grant of 45,000 euros for the new equipment car Water rescue of the volunteer fire brigade Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte at the Lahnstein City Hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate supports us in this,” says Lahnstein’s mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment car is used by the diving staff Lahnstein, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Over and under water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein you can expect to see a steady increase in operations: The boom of hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read at 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I have followed their recommendations but have synced, removed and reloaded the app NOTHING has worked.
I'm a bit frustrated because the whole action has already taken me a lot of time and now I'm hoping for help.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection from #PRS_ORG# to June.
Can I enter an appointment during the order process?

Thank you for standing here for the whole thing, I also spent almost a decade in state service in a similar activity, that is, we were also weapons carriers in the executive, I do not want to go into that!
I always find the question of the right and the left to be very simplified.
In principle, however, one should say that of course the public servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum rather than from the revolutionary left, that should be clear to everyone.
That, of course, even in a special uniform and weapon bearer, people to the right of conservative magic should also be clear to everyone that I can then naturally save you from the living reality is of course also clear, because you have, of course, besides the average white, now many Germans with a migration background, women and also homosexuals (and thus I don't have to leave them to an exaggerated feminine stereotype but rather to the men who are in the executive).
But these marginal groups also represent, even if it sounds strange to my experience for a conservative attitude, i.e. they are proud of Germany and feel less picked up by exaggerated left-wing politics, even though these policies supposedly work for them or think they have to do it right, they simply want to be treated as normal.
Back to the right, since of course the police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme rights there, but they can openly say their opinion there or even openly make any state-threatening plans is mediaally completely exaggerated and also angers me.
Of course, it happens that even police officers and soldiers who were often employed abroad often start to flatulate due to negative experiences and also sometimes say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also happens that certain right-wing connoisseurs meet who are engaged in a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, I think that this is a good fight and is also countered with political education and education!
Germany is so intertwined internationally, and I think that’s a good thing that we couldn’t afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
Yes, which I do not understand, I also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why would this come from England?
When I ordered it, it wasn't sold out.
I ordered it in November.
but it was so confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It is still about my order, which is no longer available.
I've chatted with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, you could deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in black to Germany or this basket is available in Germany somewhere.
I always find you as a partner company.
But at the top of the wooden part are two deep notches filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
More orderly by child?
Hi, me (w32) has been busy for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work, (I am self-employed, very little free time), but all my life I get it more bad than right to keep my household permanently clean and tidy.
There are always phases in which everything remains, and then and when it grabs me and I clean up and clean up.
But it’s never like this: “Someone could come to visit spontaneously.”
My husband is (unfortunately) no better either, although it bothers me somewhere but most of the time the household simply loses against work and discontent.
The kitchen is still cleaned the most regularly as we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to get more organized with your child?
We don’t have one yet, but we’ve been working on it for quite some time now.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just doesn’t bother me so much as long as no visit comes and for example there is always fresh clothes and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a bigger incentive with a child or do you stay sloppy?
I look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, high-quality and anatomically shaped cut, offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit and thus allows for almost unlimited freedom of movement.

Career in social work - as someone with a self-insecure personality disorder?
I have been training in software development and have been studying for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I am increasingly noticing that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been thinking about starting again for a long time and studying social work.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or fearfully avoidable) personality disorder (EVPS).
This means roughly that I have no self-esteem and am accordingly shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a professional level, but I find it very difficult to have casual conversations and I have been told many times that I seem unattainable (which I think has already improved).
Can I become a social worker?
I do not want to work as a street worker or in the open youth meeting, but rather in, for example, addiction counseling or family help.
But I don’t know if the specific everyday work is really the way I imagine it, and it’s hard to find anything on the Internet.
The <0xC3><0x84>VPS is already leading to problems in my job (for me, emotionally) because it pulls me down every time there is something to complain about my code ("even the simplest things seem to happen again") and I find it difficult to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should now really know for myself how to do this"/"I'm keeping him off work with my stupid questions"/"he really thinks I'm a bit underweight).
I will probably have the problems in every profession but I wanted to mention it in the place.
Did you get the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation of that either.
I'm waiting for an appointment for pick-up
What do you mean to give back, please?
If I downloaded a book on the #PRS_ORG#, the message Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book
Are there any problems?
I was in chat with #PRS_ORG# who asked me if I got a delivery confirmation for my closet.
The protein (protein) absorbed with the feed divides the bird in its gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein building materials (amino acids) and builds from these in turn its own body proteins, which it also needs for feathering.
The formation of feathers in the nestling and the formation of feathers in the mausoleum are extremely complex processes and associated with a particularly high stress for the overall organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, as otherwise there may be disturbances in the course of breeding.
Following this curative administration of NEKTON-Bio, NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be re-administered for daily vitamin supply.

1 g of NEKTON bio on 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/feed daily.
One coated measuring spoon (inside) corresponds to 1 g of NEKTON bio.
In the event of severe feather damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning until the approach to feather regeneration is visible.
Thereafter, the normal dose is reached until the regeneration of the plumage is complete.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sun exposure, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse them, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an e-mail on Monday to tell you that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this e-mail?
Statement by a community employee in opposition to the statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
So a case application has been made to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the fall of fruit trees and thus also the walnut is not part of the statute.
In the statutes, however, the walnut is explicitly stated as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the employee’s statement or not?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your reply
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I didn't receive a message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What were more expensive?
Yes, I think that’s just the question of whether I can pay in euros and have the ceiling delivered to Germany.
Can you check that?
Emergency report: Heavy traffic accident at Selb

Ah, okay, understand.
Thank you again for making it so easy!
Advice and ideas for further professional life
Merry Christmas to you for the first time!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is moderately good, because my dear head is just slashing everything you can think of.
Before I get out here .. in short: I need advice and best of people who somehow know my situation - that is, of you.
I'm just doing the ref as a cross starter.
Originally I studied something else and worked there in an area (to stay at least a little anonymous, I don’t call anything more specific here).
The whole thing was too boring for me and I was looking for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
At some point, I ended up at the teacher’s office and I was sure that it was – even though the framework conditions are much more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn’t care.
I have now arrived at the third "I Google other job postings".
And it's only half a year around.
In the paintings before that I have always decided to continue and at least finish the ref, after which I can still swing around.
But right now I'm absolutely done.
I had so little free time last month that I was completely exhausted.
Now it’s a holiday, but there’s still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but there was also my weekend and my evening of work.
I was free.
And the stress at work didn’t matter in the moments.
Now the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are those rigid structures that additionally bother me.
Basically, it is fun and from the outside the ref also runs well, as far as the feedback and so on.
But I’m completely leached out and wonder how much stress my body will endure before it completely shuts down — if it doesn’t already.
I wonder if I would like to have that for the rest of my working life - especially if I read some of your contributions here - or if I should not go back to the old area, since where I was valued, I could take free time when I needed it, and the work was somehow boring, but was paid for it appropriately and together in a team that has worked out mostly as a single fighter like that.
But then I wonder if in a year I didn’t get back to the same place as now and I’m dissatisfied.
You see, it's all kind of confusing, but maybe as an outsider you've got advice or ideas like me out of this situation that I'm completely done and almost at the slightest thought of crying.
I’m not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, which probably leads to nothing good.
But maybe your views help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel – or to enjoy Christmas, that’s enough for me for the first time.
Thank you for reading and apologize for the crying undertone of me.
I hope my situation has at least become a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series of VOX has been constantly evolving, which has led to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps we present a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely up-to-date in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET (Virtual Element Technology) technology, which is based on the analysis of the components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers have an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances only sprout like this.
With VOX’s “Tone Room” software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound the way you’ve always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology presented in 2001.
Of course, it has since been refined several times to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 has once again led to a boost in performance of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics as well as more numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series was also designed in such a way that all guitarists looking for a maximum sound variety will find here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a bold sound, a nuanced playing dynamics and a string stop, as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the power stage primarily determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly captures the behavior, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic loses at Clippers
The Losing Series of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but to win against the Los Angeles Clippers it is not enough.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven counts from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placeable and foldable velcro dividers, it depends on the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame mirror reflex cameras.
What ultimately fits into the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible fitting would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a plug-in flash.
Larger DSLR cameras such as the different models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for further lenses.
You can also store a lot of accessories.
And if you have a small DSLR camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) you can use the backpack for its equipment and for photo-foreign things.
The Everyday Backpack 20L is also the ideal choice for drone pilots, as the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcano eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the almost three months since the outbreak, lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is there an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the well-known history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday.
So far, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic Island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still nameless volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists still dared not predict when it might end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the President of the Island Council, Mariano Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez Zapata, the state-run TV channel RTVE.
Damages in millions
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, the more than 1000-degree hot lava has destroyed nearly 2,900 homes and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Nearly 1,200 hectares were covered by a layer of lava.
This corresponds to almost 1,700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, the damage estimated at more than 900 million euros.
In front of the coast, two new landings with a total size of about 50 hectares were created by cold lava.
It was particularly affected by the enormously important banana cultivation for the island, of which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, other areas severely affected, the newspaper "El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s" wrote.
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is on the doorstep and especially the children will hardly be able to wait for the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension something seductive in itself.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss had been a peace-making "social contract of natural peoples", can escape the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Nicholas became the child of Christ
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants, through whom the Christmas days were closely linked with the giving.
Previously, gifts were presented on St. Nicholas’ Day in one way or another.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw three women into their windows one night in order to save them another life in sin.
From this unconventional way of giving, the custom popular in Germany emerged to fill the boots with gifts, especially the children.
Protestants met with this custom because they reject mediators between God and man as “sacred worship.”
For these reasons, they defend themselves against the institution.
Martin Luther made Nikolaus the child of Christ and thus founded a new line of tradition.
The focus of the gift thus shifted to the Christmas Eve.
However, since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions so closely, it only upsets the few that the custom of St. Nicholas is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas period, much like the Martin custom with Martinssingen and Martinswing.
Today you can find everything your heart desires in boots at the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Diversity of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources prove a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of bestowal shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian countries, however, there is a cheerful pillow bag about the question of who will bring the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region, whether the Christ child appears on the Holy Evening or the Santa Claus, who is basically a kind of Nicholas, to whom some peculiarities have been assigned over time.
These include, for example, his white moustache, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sled, which is pulled by retirees and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain the Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana, who is said to have shown them the way to the Child Jesus.
In Scandinavia, fairytales sometimes bring the gifts, while in Russia, it brought some glory to Father Frost.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sled as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the course of the Hussite wars, the Christian child is responsible for the handover of the gifts.

Police shoot alleged bank robbers near the Royal Palace
Near Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot by police on Saturday.
Police said callers had reported a man who allegedly went to a bank with a gun and the business of a bookmaker.
The man fled, according to authorities, in a vehicle that could be stopped a little later by officials.
The gun was shot and the man was hit.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police did not start from a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.

Pill problem
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I hope I do everything right here, after a year of reddit is actually my first post.
To my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had so incredibly bad pain during the period and shit PMS before the period.
Now I would like to keep it because I already have to take enough medication due to chronic diseases that I can’t choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had gotten from 0 to 100 explosive pimples on my last about two years break and these everywhere.
So far so superficial, but it really put a lot of strain on me and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two-year break, the whole thing has never really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid that this time.
Perfume-free and without tinting is my cosmetics already, but maybe there's what someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the doctor did not take me so seriously and the dermatologist's appointment is yet to come.
Thank you to everyone who read the novel!
Yes, the sweet skin is such a thing.
Pre-bupertary had severe neurodermitis, then a time of rest, then large-area nodules and the acne issue.
I also tried everything possible in the course of chr. illness and I have stayed on down sugar, milk and low meat mixed food, because nothing else worked so well.
It may also be good that Hormonal is simply the worm in it, but if you like me everywhere you want to go you don’t want to go looking for something else that is still going wrong.
I already had everything of her colleague Semina o.e.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was answered to my request.
I always have to work in between and on the phone and suddenly everything was gone...
What is there to check if the money was there, I would have seen it

110kV earth cable will be rebuilt in 2022
The approval for the installation of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is valid.
The planning decision of the Government of Lower Bavaria paves the way for construction, which is scheduled to begin in 2022.
This was announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven kilometres long earth cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected near the village of Edermanning near Reut to a mast of the overhead line.
Good morning,
my order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has so far only arrived in parts with us.
The blue bet number: #PRS_ORG# with the shipment number #NUMBER# has been returned by #PRS_ORG# with the entry "Not possible delivery".
All three other packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next step is?
A great start to the week!
You can forget that, I already explained this several times yesterday!!
This is a chest of drawers made of glass and the entire sides are popped up, so is everywhere glass and the carton is broken
The dresser is standing in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come to the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG# provisions
This means that the dresser cannot be picked up because no one can enter my apartment
Thanks for the message
Why only $20?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it's all books, which is why the request for #PRS_ORG# is probably a general problem
Ref: Planning lessons (EC)
Dear colleagues,
I have been in the Ref since summer, teaching is fun, but I still have big problems at the moment to plan my lessons in the field of earth science in a time-efficient way.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so in principle I can only use the board, the textbook and an OHP as a medium.
In school I can also only copy b/w for free (which is annoying for earth science).
I just need a long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently doing the topic of geofactors and with me actually stands every hour for itself.
In principle, the methods always repeat themselves, but on the other hand I do not want to invest excessively much time for simple lessons (which I also need for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build this up (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn’t have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
Therefore, the worksheets as well.
Maybe I can be a geography teacher on how to work with the book in a timely manner.
I'd be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #Number#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to process the return as soon as possible.
Trade fears for the 2G regulation about Christmas business.
In most shops, only those who are vaccinated or cured are allowed.
Trade thinks this is unnecessary and complains about revenue cuts.
He also has a possible solution ready.
The 2G regulations spoil the important Christmas business from the point of view of the Handelsverband Deutschland (HDE).
When dealing with items of non-daily need, sales losses could be lamented, HDE chief executive Stefan Genth criticized.
According to a recent HDE survey of 1,100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies looked negatively at the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
“What should actually be the positive highlight of the year is now often a hole without ground,” Genth said.
Traders with 2G access restrictions lost nearly a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
It only works well in food retail and online.
The association called for consequences from dramatic development.
Purchasing with a mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, the chief executive said.
"2G in shopping does not take us further in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations deterred customers and required high staffing.
The tape regulation must be approved nationwide, he demanded.
After that, each customer must only be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or cured) and would have access to all stores with the ribbon received on that day.
In addition, in the retail sector - as already in public transport under the 3G rule (vaccinated, cured or tested) - sampling checks should be sufficient.
The real estate group Deutsche Euroshop, which specialises in shopping centres, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last without 2G at a good 75 percent of the pre-Corona level, sales at about 90 percent.
These figures will now fall safely in the middle of such an important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high staff and administrative effort, the Centers are trying to find solutions and get approved.
This includes the so-called ribbon solution, in which "the visitors can, for example, provide their 2G proof at a central point in the center and afterwards - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - can enter all shops without interruption". dpa
I recently ordered and delivered the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and on the frame is also an error that was tried to be covered with a yellow filler.
That looks unbeautiful.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and glued it on.
How do I proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color reproduction.
For adjusting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp, a modern microprocessor provides exceptional possibilities.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and store the color temperature in the range from 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in Flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is simple and intuitive to use.
The light produces a very light stream with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The 120 degree beam angle that allows you to illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance is excellent.
By the way, even in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness virtually without changing the color temperature.
It’s a great tool to work both on the movie set or in the studio.
The optionally available DMX512 controller allows remote control of the luminaire in TV studios or when the luminaire is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, it consists of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the memory slots, one of the memory keys is simply occupied and finished by longer pressing.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when switching off, so that the known situation is again in the case of new switching on - Very practical in the studio work when, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality results from the possibility of operating with cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and camera men (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester equal to built-in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply power to the headlamp via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
You have to attach a 16mm sleeve as a connection, so you can directly to your photo stand.
The inclination must be reliably adjusted by means of fixing devices on both sides.
It has been taken care that the mechanical components are also extremely high-quality and, as a result, are also designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, a tilt joint is included in the delivery.
Great is that included in the delivery also a bag.
So you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you might want to buy without any problems.
Sorry, I got it and it's too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw away": Frankfurt celebrates after a furious comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last twice in a series of victorious Hessen were supposedly on their way to the next Bundesliga podium.
But then the SGE turned up, shot the frustration over a full season start from the soul within a good hour, and triumphed furiously with 5:2. "It's madness what the boys did today," coach Oliver Glasner cheered at DAZN and said a "paushal-lob, to every single one who was with it".
At first, it looked like a new damper for the Frankfurters still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick led the Leverkusen with 2-0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE coach.
“How the players came back and showed a fantastic performance,” Glasner continued.
I am incredibly happy with the performance we have shown and of course also with the result.
Also defensive player Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the ground for the first time since the fourth day of the game and his overcome muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
“I think our mentality is incredibly big,” said the 27-year-old, looking forward to the result especially for the viewers.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
Glasner wants to keep the focus on the tasks ahead, but he also sees himself well positioned in terms of the personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that we all have players fit in December that all players are physically in a top constitution.
It is top work in our medical department, but also the players live highly professional.
Now one wants to "step forward and remain modest" and "get through" the tasks at this level by the turn of the year.
Next on Wednesday in the course of the English week, an away game with Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 o’clock, Sky) is on the programme.
Grade I get the mail that my package comes back to you due to an error on my part.
I tried to call at #PRS_ORG# and let it redirect, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money has been returned and re-ordered?
For me, unfortunately, this means that I will not order again because it has taken a long time.
Have they ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Damper for handball women before quarter-finals against Spain
After the humiliation against Denmark, Germany’s handball women shuddered with hanging heads and empty eyes from the parquet.
At the end of the World Cup main round, the DHB selection at 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers scored a rough defeat and now has to run against host Spain in the quarter-finals.
“We were far too scared and had too much respect for the opponent,” Federal coach Henk Groener said.
We have to act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a pity we couldn't take the flow with us.
This was a bad game for all of us to delete,” said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for entry into the semi-finals, a significant increase must be made against the World Cup second of 2019 next Tuesday to keep the delicate dream of the first medal alive since 2007.
Best German pitcher in the duel with the three-time Olympic winner Denmark was back-room player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We just weren't there - neither in the attack nor in the defense," admitted backroom player Xenia Smits, demanding, "We need to look forward quickly now."
From front to back not at the height
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not at the top.
Mistakes and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a quick 0-4 gap after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately up to operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The first goal was achieved by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counter-strike.
However, the expected initial ignition was not.
Against the aggressive cover of the Danes, the German women could hardly get on the scene - and if so, they mostly failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of the Scandinavians.
So the game had run early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since backroom player Mia Zschocke saw red just a little later because of a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarter-finals, however, she is allowed to play again.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection get a little better into the game and until the break at least five goals.
The hope for a catch-up after the change was already gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Groener supporters sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-placed opponent, who is one of the medal candidates at the final round.
As a result, the German team could no longer stand up for a performance increase and went off the parquet as a clear loser.

The title states that I am a vaccine doctor in mobile vaccine teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated in nursing homes.
Since these are soon to be finished in large part, it will then be continued in vaccination centers for me.
I would like to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, if these are not related to one personally (e.g. "I take medicine X, this is compatible with vaccination.").
In my area of responsibility, the education for the vaccination, the indication position (person is entitled to a vaccination according to the Corona vaccination regulations and no reasons that speak against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care in case of allergic reactions (I have never done so).
Vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical professionals.
In vaccine teams, however, we often do not have any, but "only" (for God's sake, not a lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for vaccine preparation, but they can't carry out any vaccinations (doesn't they?), so I also carry out most vaccinations there myself.
Heavy "Huidler" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "Huidler"?
With this dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, the BR TV show "We in Bavaria" has been made for intense reflection.
But unlike many previous days, the term in the series "Host me?" remained unanticipated by the callers this time.
No, it wasn't a "man who's nervous."
And no one has to “get it all done fast.”
That, people heard from the TV presenter, was completely wrong.
On which the man from Amberg communicated the solution and thus probably also caused surprise for many upper Palatinates.
"The skinner," the audience heard, "is a rag with which someone wipes out the oven."
Dialectist Antony Rowley, an expert on Bavarian television for years, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more well-known word "parents".
With which an educational gap was closed - probably also for some who have lived in the area of Amberg for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books in two weeks.
There is always the following error message after confirmation: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I restarted the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, connected to the PC, synchronized and repaired.
Nothing helped.

This morning I woke up full of enthusiasm, because I wanted to train at least a little in preparation for my bike tour next week.
Said, done and I drove with my road bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then what happened in every city center (this time: Thank you Krefeld!) happened.
Glass splitter on the track.
Zack, loud squeezing and my rear tire didn’t want to take part in the rest of the track anymore.
As I had no real chance to get a replacement coat and hose due to the day of the week, I had to turn around again with a half bad mood and take the first train home.
It wasn’t that bad in terms of launcing, maybe it’s better if I do it again before the bike tour with the tyre change.
Now I have a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance over several days ahead of me, I would be extremely reluctant to get this problem more often.
Now it was really not bad, because the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, on the day I picked up the bike by 2 p.m. 120km!) and who had already described it as suboptimal, because he has been on a roll with them for several years.
But if I think I still have to make a tire change while driving after 80-90kms, then I think I’m really in a bad mood :D
Now I met an older man at the platform who asked me why I didn’t have the Marathon Plus tyres; they should be unflattering.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are they really that incapacitated?
I don’t feel like spending $40/slips now, just to be disappointed.
I also wonder: I currently have 25x622 on the road bike.
They are also available (apparently?) on the Marathon Plus tyres, but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally advise me on other tyres in a road bike?
The Schwalbe page seems to be my absolute one! Lay knowledge rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thanks in advance for the help and greetings!
Car tossing against tree: driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had collided on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for an unexplained reason against a central island and then got on the counter-road, police said.
There was a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old’s car was then thrown against a tree and the man was trapped in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old co-driver were seriously injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.

After the release of our new high-end wideband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would also have offspring again.
SOLO 15 is the new sprössling and is visually reminiscent of the big models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this proposal includes an appropriately designed foot directly to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
Due to the principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for persons where the maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but is to be achieved in an exceptionally high sound level.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not able to produce such large sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she appears significantly adult and for her size extremely impressive and accurate.
Tonal, the SOLO 15 was matched with a slight high-tone rise.
This is common in broadband in order to optimize the too high frequency banding.
Precisely oriented to the listening area, the SOLO 15 convinces with very clear and fine sound.
The high-tone range can be slightly rotated to the outside and thus the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor sharp and surprisingly precise.
The reference-suspecting extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure a fine dynamic that looks the same.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but extends it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to start by thinking about the final appearance of the speaker in order to plan for corresponding changes in construction.
If, for example, the housings are to be veneered, the reduction of the loudspeaker must be adjusted accordingly, since the veneer again applies material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. in the construction market), you should first drill an 8 mm hole into the bottom plate at the appropriate location in order to be able to carry out the cable there later without any problems.
With the help of a top milling machine, the loudspeaker opening now follows in the front, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used flush later.
On the back side, this opening should be provided with a 45° phase in order to make the opening surface of the loudspeaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screwing points of the B 100 - 6 OHM receive an interruption in the phase, as shown in the picture "Detail Phase".
Then you start with the actual structure of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The rear wall, the lid, the front and the floor are now glued onto these.
The three reinforcements should also be used and glued.
If necessary, the reinforcements themselves can vary in material thickness, provided, for example, you want to use finished strips from the construction market instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side is attached.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
By means of a suitable hole circular saw or a forest drill, the mounting of the openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connection terminal on the rear wall, is facilitated.
Then you use a round cutter to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the base plate can also be rounded.
Subsequently, the base plate is firmly glued to the base of the housing and additionally screwed with long wooden screws.
The following is the marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the connection points of the loudspeaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (suction / blow-out), you start laying the cable.
This is most easily achieved by the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the rear wall.
In doing so, you push the entire and unshortened cable piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot to the terminal opening and let it stand out there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the case, the cable is led to the speaker opening and also let it hang out there loosely.
In the following, the frequency switch is prepared and used.
The construction plan of the frequency switch, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be found in the following document:
If the frequency switch is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box is followed, which is not yet completely closed.
Due to the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, hot glue can be dripped onto the opening and thus closed.
Through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp one can check the seal accordingly.
Now the damping follows according to the description.
The B 100-6 OHM is then connected and screwed with the corresponding screws.
The polarity plays an important role in this, so that the plus line (marked cable) must be soldered to the plus pole of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and plugged in.
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and distributed loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
Hello to everyone,
> Finally, we can announce that we are hosting the OSCAST again this year!
> Unfortunately, for known reasons, it is not possible to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-term duration of the announcement.
ATTENTION: There will be at least three people by switch, so we’ll be tracking the 2021 Oscars with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it’s still a pandemic – yet we will give everything to accompany the Oscars as entertainingly as possible.
> It will start around 0:30.
Have a cold drink, plan good food and get ready for a long, but very interesting night.
