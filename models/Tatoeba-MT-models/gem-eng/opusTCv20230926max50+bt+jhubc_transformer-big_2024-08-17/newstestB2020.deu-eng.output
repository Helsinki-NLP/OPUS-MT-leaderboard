Fire extinguished in French chemical plant
The big fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen has been extinguished. This was reported by the prefecture of Normandy on Friday. The fire broke out on Thursday night. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in operation with around 200 fire trucks.
The fire could be stopped.
Residents were called upon not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 metres were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday. Additives for lubricants are produced in the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine River. The factory is part of the Lubrizol company of US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive of the EU, which imposes particularly strict safety regulations.
Around 400 people work in the plant. The chemical factory has already made headlines in the past - for example, when in 2013 a leak caused the gas to escape methanol and the environment to smell far-reaching amounts of rotten eggs. In 2015 about 2,000 liters of mineral oil flowed into the city's wastewater system after an operating accident.
Woman quits her job to search 57 days for her missing dog
For two months, a woman from Washington searched for her missing dog - and announced her job. The seven-year-old Border Collie had left the hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. 57 days were missing from the dog every trace - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I got sick," said Carole King to "Daily Inter Lake." She and her husband had left dog Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie disappeared. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Donner had put the dog in a panic
In the hope that Katie could still stay somewhere in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says, 'She left about four, four and a half hours ago'," Carole King recalls to "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie immediately ran out. Presumably a loud thunder had left the dog in panic.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings searched for their beloved dog. But from days were weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," Carole King told the Daily Inter Lake, who quit her job as a mailman to continue her search for Katie.
"The tears flowed"
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King got a call: A man called and said that Katie was in his yard. But when King arrived, Katie had already disappeared again. She searched the neighborhood and suddenly her bitch was under a tree. "I just thought she was hugging. I didn't want to let her go," King recalled, "The tears flowed to her vehicle."
Losses in the Bundeswehr: Machine guns disappear without a trace
Friday, 27 September 2019
Six machine guns of type MG3 are still missing.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost many weapons and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition, including three machine guns. In most cases, the stay is unclear. The opposition speaks of a "intimidating" extent.
In the Bundeswehr, weapons and ammunition are constantly disappearing - many of them so far without a trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the troop has booked the loss of 39 weapons, 39 pieces of weapons and almost 20,000 rounds of ammunition. This is based on a list of the Federal Ministry of Defence, which the editorial network Germany reports on.
According to the paper from the Office of Defense Secretary Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one weapon part and 3474 rounds of ammunition have so far reappeared. The weapons and weapon parts that have still disappeared are, among other things, six machine guns of type MG3, eleven G3 rifles, four G36 rifles, six signal guns and two M3 pistols.
The extent of gun and munitions losses in the Bundeswehr was "fearful," said the German-backed A-Municipalist, Martina Renner. This was all the more true, since little was found in the course of the investigation. The left-wing politician spoke of a "difficult balance sheet". Renner also criticized the fact that under the listing was not recognizable.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after its capture by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As ship observation data from Refinitive showed, the tanker set in motion and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was indicated as the destination port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had already been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but it initially remained in Iranian waters. The shipping company said it wanted to wait for an official message from Tehran.
The Stena Impero was charged with violating security rules by Iranian Revolutionary Guards on the Strait of Hormuz on 19 July, but it was suspected that Iran was responding to the controversial temporary arrest of an Iranian oil tanker in front of the UK-based Gibraltar.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important waterways in the world, connecting the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the global oil exports are being shipped through the straits. Tensions in the region have intensified in recent months. Commercial shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the US and Iran. There have been several incidents involving tankers and drones.
Merkel Appreciates People's Courage in the Peaceful Revolution
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has praised the commitment of the people of the GDR, who went on the streets 30 years ago during the Peaceful Revolution. In the fall of 1989, courageous citizens had shaken the then GDR regime, Merkel said at a ceremony of the Thuringian CDU faction on the upcoming day of German unity in Erfurt.
Musk is aiming for an extradition record
Tesla’s quarter may hold a record, but despite the delivery boom, there have been recent losses at the electric car company.
New York.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car group a strong boost with the prospect of new record numbers on the stock exchange. “We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries,” Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog Electrek.
The demand was strong, so Tesla could book 110000 orders, it continued in Musk’s circular. The challenge is to quickly bring the cars to the customer base, and Tesla must provide as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla’s shares went out of business with an increase of over 6%. The price has not increased for nearly four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered a good 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers need to be produced in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
Solved puzzles: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the cerebellum prevents people from being able to tickle themselves. This was found by scientists at Humboldt University in Berlin with the help of experiments on rats, as they announced on Thursday evening. Progress has also been made on the question of why children so violently fight tickling, only to demand more.
Finally, it has also been shown why the approach of a tickling hand alone triggers laughter even before the touch, which lies on a deep layer in the cerebellum, which already triggers laughter when the tickling is expected.
According to the data, earlier research showed that rats react with "laughing" in the ultrasound range when tickled by humans. This "laughing" is mediated by the part of the cerebral cortex that serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughing is suppressed during self-touching
So far it has been assumed that the brain can distinguish between self-contact and touch by others - that is why people cannot tickle themselves. But the Berlin researchers now found in the experiments on the rats that the laughter as well as the activity of the relevant area of the cerebral cortex were suppressed during a self-contact. But this was also the case when the living beings themselves clean themselves. During the alien, the laughter was suppressed by a self-contact.
But if self-contact and touch by others at the same time, laughter is also suppressed. This suggests that the rat’s brain cannot distinguish between self-contact and touch by others. The new findings suggested that people cannot tickle themselves because self-contact activates a brake in the cerebellum.
In addition, the rats were trained to tickle themselves. They sometimes prematurely discontinued this initiation in the experiment, showed escape behavior or horror. This ambivalence equals the behavior of the children. The ambivalence of tickling is a behavioral reaction that is the same in rats and humans.
Disaster Averted: French chemical plant extinguished large-scale fire
The Great Fire in a particularly dangerous chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen has been extinguished. This was reported by the Normandy prefecture of the AFP news agency on Friday. The fire broke out on Thursday night.
According to the authorities, no hazardous substances should have been released. The samples taken do not give any cause for concern, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in operation with around 200 fire trucks.
Schools and kindergartens closed
Residents were called not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday.

Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister
The Prime Minister’s sister commented on Boris Johnson’s speech at Parliament’s first meeting after lifting the bailout on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister threatens to lead the country out of the EU on 31 October without agreement, should Brussels not respond to his demands for changes to the Brexit agreement. However, how he wants to achieve this is unclear.
Speaking about Cox, who had campaigned for Britain’s stay in the European Union, the Prime Minister said: “The best way to honor Jo Cox’s memory and rejoin this country would be to carry out the EU’s exit.” Cox had been murdered by a right-wing extremist during the 2016 referendum campaign.
Memorial to the attacks of Oslo and Utöya is revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 dead, a memorial to the victims is unveiled in Norway on Saturday. The monument "Jernrosene" (German: the Iron Roses) consists of about 1,000 iron rose replicas. They recall the roses that thousands of people had taken in the days and weeks after the attacks in front of the cathedral in Oslo.
In the same place, the project of artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud will be unveiled - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and victims. For the opening, Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit are expected.
On 22 July 2011, right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik first set fire to a car bomb in Oslo’s government district and subsequently shot dozens of participants in a holiday camp of the youth organization of the Social Democratic Workers’ Party, killing 77 people in the attacks.
Iran Releases British Tankers
The UN general debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict, but now there is one less problem. The Iran-held British oil tanker "Stena Impero" could re-enter the sea. It could be a puzzle piece in the Iranian President Ruhani's peace plan.
The British oil tanker Stena Impero, which has been held in the Strait of Hormus in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters. After being released by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, according to the shipping company Stena Bulk.
The Stena Impero had left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew now travel to Dubai for medical investigations, among other things, said Erik H<0xC3><0xA5>nell, a shipping company. By midday, the ship had left the Iranian waters.
“This is part of a pattern of attempts to undermine the freedom of the seas, working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law,” the statement said.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had set the tanker on July 19 on the charge of failing to comply with Persian Gulf maritime law. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crew members are doing well in the circumstances, H<0xC3><0xA5>nell said. They would have been working together in the face of the difficult and extirpating situation of their families in the past ten weeks.
The British government, behind the Stena Impero, suspected a reaction to a similar incident in British Gibraltar: in early July, a supertanker with oil from Iran, which was said to have been destined for Syria, was put on the chain. The delivery allegedly violated EU sanctions against the war-torn country of Syria. The reference to the ship had been received by the British from the US.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Presumably, it was a trade deal to free the "Stena Impero", London vehemently rejected.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important waterways in the world, connecting the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world’s oil exports are being shipped through the straits. Tensions in the region have intensified in recent months. Commercial shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the US and Iran. There have been several incidents involving tankers and drones.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between the two countries. The Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. In 2018, the US unilaterally withdrew from the international nuclear agreement, which would prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb and at the same time end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has expanded its leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions.
Because of the dispute over the "Stena Impero" and other incidents involving tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, the United States is working on a coalition for the military protection of merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani presented a plan for security and peace in the Straits of Hormuz at the UN General Assembly in New York. With the initiative "Coalition of Hope" for the Persian Gulf, Iran, together with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign protection powers, wants to ensure the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would actually be predestined as a "war winner". In view of the punitive tariffs that the US President Donald Trump imposes on Chinese producers, the US government has created a large-scale trade union with the US. In a survey conducted by the UBS, it is clear that this is not one of the preferred alternatives for foreign producers in the People's Republic of China.
But now India itself has become the focus of Trump’s attention. Describing the haudegen in the White House as a “Kingdom of Tariffs”, America has withdrawn trade concessions for 2,000 products to the emerging world in early June. The US accuses India of prohibitively high tariffs and calls for better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
Of course, on the world map of trade wars, the frictions with India are just a side-show. In addition, America also looks at the world’s largest democracy through the security glasses. Delhi and Washington combine the concern about China’s power claims in the South Indian Ocean. Against this backdrop, a salvo of American punitive tariffs against India is unlikely to take place, and India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just taken office in the second time.
The problem, however, lies in another place: the empirically hardened thesis that open markets seem to accelerate economic development, has a difficult standing in the socialist Republic of India. Also under modes. Its reform zeal mainly aims at the bureaucratic madness that has suffocated any entrepreneurial spirit in the multi-country state for too long. Companies now get faster building permits for construction.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. In India, from an economic point of view, much has turned for the better in the first five months of the year. But this is not the case in trade policy. This inspires to protect internationally low-competitive companies from foreign suppliers, the national conservative government even created new barriers.
In the West, Modi adheres to the nimbus of the energetic reformer, who is politically radical in his country. This impression is due not least to the fact that the charismatic prime minister only knows too well which vocabulary Western managers like. At its core, the "India First" lawyer never deviated from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced into a protectionist economic policy.
Completion of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
Former French President Jacques Chirac is expected to be buried in Paris next week. The former head of state will be buried at the Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the French capital on Monday, the news agency AFP reported citing the Chirac family. The funeral will take place in the close family circle. For Sunday, a public funeral was scheduled in Paris's Invalidendom.
Competitors: Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Athletics Championship
The top of the world was already in the finish line when the half-shattered scenes in the cooled Khalifa International Stadium stopped in the middle of the final finish line. In the first run of the men over 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby from Aruba started to swing dangerously. He could barely keep himself on his feet about 300 meters before the finish, ran in an unhealthy bent position when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same thing," Dabo said after the race in Mixed Zone, when he was unable to start the country completely unexpectedly, to attract the attention of the assembled journalists. At first, he was shy, did not want to talk about his heroic act at all. After all, he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he realized that this would be difficult, he just wanted to help out without suffering.
He did this with great emphasis on the evening - and much more intense than he would have thought. Because this heroic act will be remembered. Especially because Dabo even left his competitor Busby in the finish line and voluntarily took the last place - by the way, well five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this lead. In the end, it was not used by the end of the finish line.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies there in Lisbon, started to set up a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, this was achieved with 18:10.87 minutes, he himself was still disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. I was already under 18 minutes". However, only in training, as best times do not count.
Egypt’s Millions of Masks Prepare for Wild Protest Day
In Egypt, security measures have been stepped up in the run-up to possible government-critical protests. In the center of Cairo, an increased police presence was observed on Friday. Several metro stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir Square were closed.
In recent days, the police had reinforced their street controls and searched pedestrians’ phones partly for news and photos related to the protests, hundreds of them being arrested, according to two non-governmental organizations.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, it had come in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura to protest with hundreds of participants, but they did not call up the central ambassador to the army. "They were targeting the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, accusing the critic of corruption and mismanagement. Such an open protest against the political leadership had not occurred in Egypt for years. The Egyptian construction contractor and actor Mohammed Ali, who lives in Spanish exile, was the Egyptian construction contractor and actor.
The number of arrests in connection with the protests rose further, according to two groups of observers. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests by Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. These figures were not confirmed by the government at first.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people have been “indiscriminately arrested” “just because they were “in the wrong place at the wrong time,” HRW said, citing lawyers arrested. The allegations against the detainees range from “spreading false information” to membership in a “terrorist association,” but also in Cairo, Alexandria, and other cities.
HRW also criticized the censorship in the North African country, according to which the government is blocking websites and online services in Cairo to stop further protests against Sisi.
Online Merchants: Shipping Merchants Can Make Returns Easier
For online retailers, many returned parcels are lost goods. Around 20 million returns end up on the garbage. However, there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online retailers like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products rather than destroy them.
While the companies could not be exempted from the VAT on donations, the Ministry explained on a question of the Green Bundestag faction, about which the newspapers of the Funke media group reported on Friday, but the traders could set the market value of the unsaleable returns so low that they would have to pay no or only little VAT.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had determined that the German citizens would return one in six parcels for orders on the Internet. Around four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - subsequently landed in the garbage. They would donate the companies according to the current legal situation would additionally cost money, because the financial authorities evaluate donations as a turnover, which then generates sales tax.
Green Group leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify that companies cannot evaluate products that are sold and donate them free of charge to non-profit organizations. The companies would have to be able to rely on not to be punished for donating. This applies not only to online trading, but also to other stores from store to store.
Banksy art at auction: there was never a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of Streetart star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", will soon be auctioned.
For Branczik, Banksy’s work underscores “the return of the world’s oldest parliamentary democracy to the basic attitude of animals and tribes”. From Saturday, the painting will be exhibited at Sotheby’s in the British capital, until it is auctioned on 3 October. It is estimated to be 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Bristol Museum in southwestern Britain, where Banksy lives. This year, the artist had again exhibited the painting - at the same time as the original Brexit date on 29 March. On this occasion, the work, formerly called "Question Hour", was renamed "Devolved Parliament" ("Delegated Parliament").
The picture could change the owner for a million dollars.
Last Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson delivered a hard-hitting exchange with the opposition at the first meeting of the House of Commons following the lifting of a bailout imposed by Johnson by the Supreme Court. Johnson wants to carry out the Brexit already postponed twice on October 31 without agreement with the EU, if necessary.
It is not the first time Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has been involved in the Brexit debate. In Dover, in south-east England, he painted a picture depicting a man breaking a star of the European flag with a chisel. The work sees thousands of truck drivers and other visitors every day when entering the UK.
Brexit debate is like a "walk in the park"
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s fierce verbal attacks on Brexit opponents in parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred. Compared to the election campaign before the Brexit referendum in 2016, the current controversy is a “walk in the park,” Dominic Cummings said at a book presentation on Friday. “We will (from the EU) quit and we will win.
Johnson had attacked Brexit opponents in parliament in recent days and accused them of, among other things, "betrayal" of the people, alleging that he could put MPs at risk because they could become targets of murder threats, he dismissed as "humbug".
Cummings said the only way to calm down is if MPs would finally respect the decision of the British to leave the EU, and it is not surprising that people were upset that Britain had not left the EU three years after the referendum.
In the face of the charged mood, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint on Friday. "We should speak with respect," it said in a statement. "And we should also listen."
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan Calls for Uno Intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict on his first appearance before the UN General Assembly.
Otherwise, another war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said Friday at the U.N. General Debate in New York. "If this is going badly, one hopes for the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations would have a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented that."
India and Pakistan have waged three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them around the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers each dominate part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China. At the beginning of August, India had stripped the Indian Kashmir region of its autonomy and thus increased tensions in relation to Pakistan abruptly.
Not even a bottle of water
Protesters in Cairo are calling for the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government reacts with a hard hand. It shoots at the population with sharp ammunition, over 2,000 prisoners join the prisons of the 60,000 political prisoners who are already sitting there. Protesting in Egypt has never been dangerous. But since the takeover of power by General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state apparatus is doing everything it takes to avoid a scenario like the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the 2011 protests was the poor economic situation. Poverty, lack of perspective and the feeling of being suffocated by one’s own government pushed millions onto the streets. And this is a problem that even the regime of el-Sisi does not get to grips with, no matter how hard it goes against adversaries. The situation has even deteriorated.
Today, every third person in Egypt lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate has become a huge part of the population. If you want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket, you have to decide who it finances: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is responsible not only for the oppression but also for the largest economic actor in the world. The military has built roads, houses, soccer stadiums, more and more.
Tüv tests in the terminal: BER boss: no more "showstoppers" for capital airport
Two months have been checked to see if the complicated system mesh works in conjunction with the BER fire protection system. The operators are satisfied with the course, but the Tüv is not yet finished at the BER.
After large-scale tüv tests at the terminal of the future capital airport, operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year, which was certain, said Supervisory Board Chairman Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the control committee.
Airport manager Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successful completion of the test, but also said that there were still defects to be dealt with in the terminal. "We have many detailed topics, but we don't have a real showstopper". He assured that the schedule until commissioning still contained buffers.
However, there is evidence that the time reserve is no longer likely to be too large. The construction production announcement is now to be submitted to the construction office during the first quarter of 2020, at the beginning of the year this was planned for this autumn.
Hundreds of defects in power cables are still to be fixed; the Tüv wants to check them until February. "In order to create the conditions for taking up flight operations here, intensive work must continue to be carried out on the processing of the defects," said a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases there is a lack of evidence, less new cables. There is no release for all the dowels on which the cable roads hang. The airport manager expects this to be available by the end of the year.
In addition, the fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal is not yet satisfactory. The problems had already led the project into another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoke aprons that run down in the event of a fire like a canvas, so that the smoke does not spread. They drive too far down. 36 engines must therefore be replaced. Then there should be new experiments with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other building defects as well as planning errors have delayed the opening of the airport for years. Originally, it was scheduled to go into operation in 2011. Costs have increased from two billion euros to around 6.5 billion euros expected to be opened next year since the start of construction in 2006.
Since the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since then, those responsible are planning to expand the airport, which is why it is scheduled to take place in a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October, as the chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Chief Financial Officer Heike Fölster will switch to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, HR Manager Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She put the airport finances on firm feet.
Chemnitz: vending machines for drugs blasted - police arrest man
He needed money for drugs - and for this he chased several vending machines in the Chemnitz area of the city! Now the perpetrator is finally in jail!
Over the past two years, the number of extorted cigarette and parking ticket machines in Chemnitz and the region has risen sharply, resulting in a million damage!
After two detonations at the end of May, the police seized a 33-year-old German on the Bürgerstra<0xC3><0x9F>e and on the Further Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigation for causing explosives explosions in fact with a particularly severe case of theft led by the Chemnitz criminal police, not only this suspicion against the 33-year-old confirmed".
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now confessed a total of eight acts.
The police spokesman: "With the loot he apparently financed his addiction to narcotics". The bomber alone had blasted parking machines on the Bürgerstra<0xC3><0x9F>e four times between 20 August 2018 and 31 May 2019.
The resulting total damage amounts to at least 60,000 euros!
The automaten-bomber is now in custody and the police investigation against him continues.
It is conceivable that he was also responsible for further machine blasts in Chemnitz and neighbouring counties.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
Lufthansa Group is revamping its strategy for Vienna Airport. In the midst of the price struggle with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, Lufthansa subsidiary AUA takes over "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights departing from Vienna", a Austrian Airlines spokesman told APA on Friday. Earlier, "AviationNetOnline" reported on this.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa low-cost airline Eurowings will thus be de facto dissolved. Of the currently seven Eurowings aircraft, four will remain in Vienna. This will take over the AUA from January 2020 in the "Wetlese", i.e. including Eurowings personnel. In Salzburg, three Eurowings jets will be stationed in the future, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter machines to holiday destinations. Routes from Vienna to Germany will be taken from Eurowings Germany via Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and the network planning, the spokesman explained. The flight times will be adjusted to connecting flights. The aim is to strengthen the hub in Vienna and, on the other hand, to expand the decentralized traffic from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, this Eurowings in Vienna is only a "Production Company" for the Group sister AUA. Among other things, Barcelona and Rome would be served with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings device. Although the on-board product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, the pilots and flight attendants come from the terminal as well as from Eurowings. The Eurowings 1 will not start under AUA flight number.
A price battle broke out at Vienna Airport after the Niki-Pleite. The Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion only announced on Thursday that the fleet in Vienna would be increased to 16 aircraft next summer. The Irish low-cost airliner sends four Ryanair machines and crews to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetlease", which the union criticized as a bypass construct to the collective agreement.
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary's campaign statement that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years, said AUA CEO Andreas Otto on Friday: "We remain the number one at the site, in five, six or ten years".
Queen-Einkelin Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children, the cousins were the best friends. Now the last of the four marries. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: In Italy holidays earlier this month, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) is said to have stopped around the hand of his girlfriend Princess Beatrice (31).
“We are thrilled to announce our engagement, and we are both so excited to begin this adventure together and can’t wait to actually be married,” the couple, who have been together since October 2018, said in the official announcement.
“We share so many similar interests and values and we know that in the years to come this will help us a lot, full of love and happiness.”
Sister Eugenie snapped the pictures
The official engagement photos have taken her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and also immediately published on her Instagram account.
A royal feast
The wedding will take place in 2020, and more information about the date, place and everything else will be announced in the coming months.
However, it is certain that the marriage of the number nine of the British succession to the throne and the real estate mogul will be a similar big celebration to the marriage of Eugenie on 12 October 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on Causes of Heart Diseases
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. But what really triggers a heart failure or an infarction? Hamburg researchers now want to look closely at the genetics of 9,000 healthy and sick people.
Through the analysis of the genetic material of 9,000 people, Hamburg and Swiss scientists want to identify the causes of cardiovascular diseases in more detail.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking region, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation supports the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland, the High Mountain Clinic Davos, which belongs to the Foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich are involved.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy diets are among the main risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is only insufficiently known, it said. Now the scientists want to compare the complete genome of 8,000 healthy people with that of 1,000 former patients of the University Heart and Vascular Center at the UKE.
Currently, more than 4,000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes are known to potentially cause disease-causing changes in DNA - so-called mutations -, the hospital said, and about 200 are added each year.
The aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, heart weakness and heart attacks. The data could also be useful in the study of other folk diseases, says Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University Heart and Vascular Center. New findings on the interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidney are possible.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), was very grateful. He also stressed that there is a firm will to use the data also for the research of other diseases. The clinic of the Foundation in Davos so far deals mainly with allergies. Now, a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine should be created on the local medical campus and a professorship for bioinformatics life in Switzerland said.
The bio-samples of the healthy participants come from Hamburgers, who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 subjects, this is the largest local health study in the world, according to the hospital. In the genetic decoding, strict attention is paid to the protection of the anonymized data, the scientists assured. It is about a petabyte (1000 terabytes) of data, said Holgers of data.
According to the UKE, a human genome can now be decoded within 24 hours. The mere material costs for this are at 1300 euros. The first gene sequencing worldwide, whose results were published in 2001, has cost several hundred million euros. The study is scheduled to start on 1 October, all 9000 samples are expected to be analyzed by the end of 2020. In the following year, first results are expected.
Nigerian police free hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, police have released more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koranic school. According to residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the still-underage victims, as police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said. "The victims were abused. Some of them said to have been raped by their teachers."
The boys had been detained under the pretext of being taught and "improved" in the Qur'an. In fact, the protégés had been detained by their teachers under "the most degrading and inhumane conditions," Sabo said. About one hundred students, including children aged nine, had been chained in a small room.
According to the Koran School, the Quran School has been in existence for about ten years. Residents had alerted the authorities to repeated irregularities in the establishment. The parents showed themselves shocked when they were informed about the conditions in the Quran School, Sabo said. They had no idea about the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested, according to police.
In the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria, there are many private Koran schools, replacing the often deficient state facilities. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN refugee agency, therefore, in the past ten months, more than 40,000 people have flown across the border into the neighbouring state of Niger.
Nigerian police to release 400 children from school
“Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries suggesting torture,” said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in the city of Kaduna.
There, the children were discovered on Thursday after a note in an Islamic school. The conditions there were "humane". The officials arrested the headmaster and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, were held at their school like slaves and put on chains. Some were sexually abused. Television images showed poor and injured students in a recognizablely poor state of health.
World Footballer’s Choice: Further Accusations of Messis and Klopps Kür
Football "Signature not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a gala in Milan, the world football association Fifa is the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi, it is the sixth honour and thus a record.
After Nicaragua's captain declared that he had never voted in the World Footballer's election, accusations came from other countries to the FIFA. Egypt was not evaluated at all - with a curious justification.
A lot of things at Fifa have turned out to be shocking in recent years: the World Cup awards, dubious plans of its President Gianni Infantino, the general behavior of various corrupt officials. However, the Fifa World Footballer election has not yet been suspected of going unsavory - if one ignores the fact that the voting national coaches and national team are more likely to follow suit.
But after Nicaragua’s captain had already complained that he had not voted at all, further inconsistencies are now emerging: Egypt complains that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah have not been taken into account, in fact they do not appear in the official and publicly visible voting overview.
Fifa apologizes in the sense that "the signatures on the electoral forms were in capital letters and therefore not valid". The Egyptian Association has been contacted several times to clarify the situation - without an answer.
Sudan's coach is also surprised
There is also a shout out from Sudan regarding the election. While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese association states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was finally evaluated: with Lionel Messi in place one, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three. However, according to Fifa, the vote was just as official and signed with the stipulations of the s.
Nicaragua’s captain Juan Barrera also made accusations: “Didn’t vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All the information about my vote is wrong, thank you,” he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguan Football Association simply voted in his name.
On Friday, the association reported: True, but of course there was no intention. The completed list of voting documents was "misguided" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, it was said in a message from the association. However, you have actually chosen the second captain Manuel Rosas. "We have taken responsibility for the administrative error".
The other cases are now being investigated by Fifa, but emphasises that the election process has been supervised externally by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. So long Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the World Footballer’s Election – and Jürgen Klopp’s World Coach of the Year.
Ukraine affair: high-ranking Republicans call for official investigation
“I think the investigation is important,” said the Republican governor of the state of Vermont, Phil Scott. “Where that leads from here is determined by the facts that are being determined.” He wanted to know more about the whistleblower affair before taking action.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations. These had shown that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj in a phone call to investigate the activities of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. Scott said Trump has been watching Biden "for years".
Republicans have so far withheld criticism of Trump for the whistleblower affair, but few have shown any discomfort about it. Scott’s statements are now a first sign of this in Trump’s party. The moderate governor of Virginia had already repeatedly opposed Trump’s policies, such as the loosening of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
As another high-ranking Republican, Charlie Baker, governor of Massachusetts, also spoke out for the investigation. “It’s a deeply disturbing situation,” Baker said. “The right course of action and responsibility for Congress is now to investigate the matter and go to the bottom of it.”
Scott and Baker, as governors of U.S. states, formally have no voice in the lawsuit against Trump, which is decided in Congress. Their statements are therefore especially symbolically important. Nevertheless, first senators of the republicans have also expressed themselves critically about the situation. Mitt Romney, for example, who represents the state of Utah in the second chamber of parliament, said the case is "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing to the U.S.
The affair could lead to the initiation of an impeachment procedure against Trump, the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation into this, accusing him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the impeachment procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, Democrats could make an impeachment effort. However, the decision on an actual impeachment was made in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success of such a procedure are therefore low. So far, no US president has been removed by an impeachment procedure of the office.
Were torturers on the board of Racketes "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily and allegedly raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
German captain Carola Rackete (31) had been arrested in June after she had illegally boarded the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees. After fierce protests and international criticism - also by Austria's Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted again after a few days by an Italian judge.
New serious allegations against Rackete are now being made. Thus, three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived with the "Sea-Watch 3" in Italy. The suspects were caught in a reception camp in Messina (Sicily) after migrants had "recognized their tormentors in Italy", but "We can't rule this out ourselves".
Police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had been raped, tortured and even murdered. It was about Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and exposed to atrocities - by repeated and constant physical violence at the time," he said.
NGOs and aid organisations now point out that they cannot know exactly who is coming on the ships. "We cannot scan who the people are. They come without passports," Neugebauer said. Torture is one of the main reasons why people flee Libya. It is therefore quite likely that perpetrators are also on the ships. "It is therefore very important that this is followed up."
Italy’s Justice Minister Matteo Salvini immediately demanded an apology from Rackete, who is still being investigated in Italy for aiding illegal immigration.
Musk is aiming for Tesla's delivery record
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car group a strong boost to the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers.
“We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries,” Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog Electrek.
The demand was strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it continued in Musk’s circular. The challenge is to quickly bring the cars to the customer base, and Tesla must provide as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla’s shares went out of business with an increase of over 6%. The price has not increased for nearly four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well over 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers need to be produced in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
U.S. Budget Struggle: Just a Bridge Funding Again
The new fiscal year will begin in the United States on October 1 without a proper budget. The Senate has followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has decided on transitional funding until November 21.
Although the U.S. Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to increase spending limits for the 2020 and 2021 financial years, the United States once again has no spending plans before the new fiscal year starting on October 1st. The Senate has followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has decided on a transitional funding (Continuing Resolution, CR) until November 21st. Without such a resolution, it would have to come to a federal shutdown on Monday.
Shutdown turned off
For the time being, the federal administration is now being funded at the level and according to the priorities of the spending plans for the financial year 2019 to end on Monday. This is because Congress has not been able to agree on the 12 spending laws that allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities. Therefore, the federal administration cannot profit from the spending framework extended for the new financial year from 1.3 bio. to 1.4 bio. $ for the time being.
Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority, but the spending laws reflect the priorities of Democrats who have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate. Conversely, the Senate also has ten of the twelve spending plans more or less ready, which are hardly capable of majority voting.
In the Senate, Republicans are apparently trying to force $12 billion for wall construction, one of President Trump’s major priorities. Democrats are interfering with the wall construction plans and their funding, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over the wall construction had already been resolved in December 2018.
At the wall construction, the ghosts separate
It is currently unclear how the parties want to get closer to this issue. More likely than an agreement on all twelve spending laws in the next seven weeks, an extension of the transitional financing is beyond 21 November. A shutdown is also not excluded at that time.
Against the background of the Congress’ continuing inability to agree on the twelve spending laws in time, and the associated danger of a shutdown, ideas for automating the process are gaining in popularity. Template S. 1877 to avoid shutdowns, the federal administration’s financing would each automatically continue at the previous year’s level, preventing the travel activities of the parliamentarians from spending plans and withholding their wages annually.
France allows artificial fertilization for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertilization will also be open to single women and lesbians in the future: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority for a government bill that allows all women to use in vitro fertilization, which is expected to significantly increase demand for anonymous seed donations.
The proposal still needs the approval of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right-wing camp had warned that in the future numerous "children without a father" could grow up. The French Bishops' Conference is also against the innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law, which Health Minister Agn<0xC3><0xA8>s Buzyn defended as a "opportunity" for society. It depicts the modern family, in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to their imagination, the costs of artificial fertilization for all women are to be borne by social insurance.
Insemination with sperm from dead husband continues to be banned
By a narrow majority, the National Assembly, on the other hand, rejected an amendment that would give widows access to the sperm of their dead husband for artificial fertilization. In Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom, artificial fertilization is allowed "post-mortem". In Germany, there have been cases in the past in which women complained in vain of the release of the sperm of a deceased child then a grave argument was allowed. The opponents of the advance in Paris, so , so , so , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
On the other hand, many MPs of the ruling party La République en Marche (The Republic in Motion, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and MPs of the opposition had expressed their support for artificial fertilization with the sperm of the deceased partner.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair that a widow can be fertilized in the future with the sperm of an unknown, but not with that of her own partner.
Until now, artificial fertilization in France is only allowed to heterosexual couples who cannot bear children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that surrogacy will continue to be prohibited.
In Germany, artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women – however, it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Compensation for climate: calls for tuition for universities are getting louder
A lot is flown at the universities. That is why the country wants to have a climate tax levied there in the future. The principals say they have no money for it. But now they are also under internal pressure.
The universities should also limit themselves to flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschulte
The discussion of a climate levy on flights from universities and universities that was originally delayed before the summer break is still planned to take place, because there is a need for a debate on the issue of the issue. After the state-rectors' conference reacted skeptically to a corresponding push from the green-black coalition, the plans now receive support from the universities. In a joint statement, the doctoral students from six Baden-Württemberg universities and a pedagogical university are pleading for a compologiety.
Russia arrests North Korean fishermen again
According to the FSB, the detainees were illegally fishing in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. At the time, there was a gunfight between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and one North Korean were injured, the fisherman later succumbed to his serious injuries. However, this time there were no casualties, it was said.
Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages, and North Korean fishermen were traveling in Russian territorial waters, where Russia’s Coast Guard, according to its own data, patrols to protect its marine biological resources.
30,000 octopus fish confiscated
During the re-checking, 30,000 squid were discovered and confiscated on the boats, as well as three fishing boats and two motor boats were seized and taken to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
Russia’s fishing authorities had not issued fishing licences to North Koreans even after complaints from local entrepreneurs this year. Thousands of North Korean fishermen have been arrested there for some time, according to media reports.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently also complained about high ecological damage caused by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with tightly meshed synthetic nets banned in Russia. These would also bring small creatures out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would take 200 years to decompose.
In the future, only 18,000 will be left: U.S. lowers asylum upper limit
The "greatest nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country in the world is shooting at protection seekers: as the State Department in Washington confirms, the upper limit for the legal influx of refugees is being lowered further. In the future, especially threatened believers and Iraqis will receive asylum.
The U.S. government wants to lower the already historically low border for the reception of new refugees again. In the 2020 financial year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people are to be allowed into the country, as the U.S. State Department said. In the almost past financial year, the limit is still 30,000 people.
President Donald Trump’s government has drastically reduced the willingness to accept protection seekers from all over the world in recent years, and under Barack Obama’s previous government, it had far higher acceptance limits.
The proposed ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the U.S. refugee program in 1980, yet the U.S. State Department described the U.S. as "the most merciful and generous nation in history", a formulation that strongly recalls the language of the incumbent U.S. president.
A “responsible approach” to refugees aims at allowing refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild their homes, Trump explained. For his hard course in migration policy, he gets a lot of support from supporters, but there is also massive criticism.
A major issue is the border with Mexico that Trump wants to lock down. In order to be able to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the national emergency. Whether there is a temporal link between the current measure and current domestic policy developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selensky affair and a potentially threatening impeachment procedure.
The U.S. government wants to focus on the admission of two groups of refugees, according to the Foreign Office: people who are being persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are at risk as a result, according to the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, while from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be admitted.
The United States wants people from this "northern triangle" of Central America to apply for asylum in other countries. Against this background, the United States has only signed with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras migration agreements to curb immigration at the U.S. southern border to Mexico.
Court orders release of orangutan from zoo
An orangutan female has been transferred from the former Buenos Aires Zoo to a detention centre for human monkeys in the United States at the request of the Argentine judiciary. The "Sandra" born in 1986 at the Rostock Zoo was granted the rights of a "non-human person", so her release was mandatory. The animal was declared a fugitive on Thursday evening, but not as a passenger, but as a freighter.
Since the 53-kilogram human affin is unable to adapt to life in the wild, it is expected to live in the open-air enclosure of the Center for Great Apes in Florida in the future. There are already 21 other orangutans and 31 chimpanzees housed, among them "Bubbles", formerly a pet of pop star Michael Jackson's pet in the Florida suburb.
"Sandra" spent several years in the former Ruhr-Zoo in Gelsenkirchen after her birth in Rostock, before moving to Buenos Aires in 1995. The process of "Sandra's" fundamental rights, which was strained by animal conservationists in 2014, helped transform the zoo from Buenos Aires into an eco-park, where a research and education centre is to be built until 2023 to preserve biodiversity.
Record for Swiss extreme climbers: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extreme mountaineer Dani Arnold has succeeded in a new Husaren ride on the almost 3000-metre-high Great Tin in the Italian Alps.
Without net, double ground or other tools, the Swiss defeated the 550-meter-high north wall of the Great Tin in a new record time.
Dressed with jeans, T-shirt and only supported by absolute freedom of vertigo, Arnold took 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the ascent, thus undermining the old mark by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now a record holder in the Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important European north walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
Despite the trade conflict with China, U.S. sporting goods manufacturer Nike has posted a significant profit increase. Net profit rose to $1.4 billion in the past quarter (nearly 1.3 billion euros). That’s 25 percent more than in the previous year’s period, as the Group announced on Tuesday. This is mainly due to the new marketing strategy “Nike Direct”, with which the Adidas competitor is directly addressing its customers online.
Sales rose to $10.7 billion in the three-month period to the end of August, with Nike sales up 22 percent in China, benefiting Beaverton, Oregon, from its approach to addressing consumers directly via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Chief Financial Officer Andy Campion announced that with strategic investments, Nike will continue to drive the “digital transformation” of the sporting goods manufacturer and thus expand its competitive advantage. Investors were pleased with the quarterly figures – the shares of the sporting goods manufacturer increased by more than five percent.
Lifelong stadium ban on racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about football pro Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the association from the Italian capital has imposed a lifelong stadium ban against a fan. The Brazilian defender Jesus had been insulted by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and urged his club to take action. "@officialasroma should be writing to his fan in 2016, what you already know about this one.
The club responded late Thursday. He reported the fan's account to Instagram and the police. In addition, the Roma supporters were never allowed to visit a game of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Italian fans regularly chant racist insults against black players of rival teams. "We can't have racism in society or in sports. In Italy, the situation hasn't improved, and that's very serious. You have to identify those responsible and throw out the stadiums," FIFA President Gianni Infantino said at the weekend.
But there were also discussions about the supporters of Juventus Turin. The Italian authorities now have 38 randaling fans of record champion Juventus Turin with stadium bans. Four of them are no longer allowed to enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police said. For the rest, therefore, bans of four to seven years apply.
The fans are in connection with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra-fan groups around Juventus. The twelve are accused of heavy extortion, money laundering and private violence. The club had launched the investigation with an advertisement last year.
According to Italian media reports, the ultra leaders are said to be behind the black trade with tickets, they have "militaryly controlled" the ticket trade for the fan curve, and they are said to have blackmailed Juventus employees to get cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, Generation Z is political - whole vintages are considered with catchy names. If you look more closely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the respective lifestyle of young people?
"The crabs are coming!" With this reputation officially launched on 21 September the crab catch at Gucheng Lake in Gaochun, which also inaugurated the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee's Public Relations Department.
Gaochun, which forms the southern foothills of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is also the Chinese seat of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has ecologically ideal conditions with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields". The great natural environment of Gaoch offers its inhabitants a rich natural environment.
The people of Gaochun have already started crab farming in the early 1990s. Over time, the crab industry has developed into a formative industry that provided high incomes and became an important part of the economic development of Gaochun. In recent years, Gaochun has been actively involved in a large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crab farming and a technology-based crab farming.
In recent years, Gaochun has brought forward a reform to "distribution of power, optimization of administration and government services" and has carefully established the service network for "authorizations under one roof, a team for law enforcement, a network for services, a platform for lending" in order to comprehensively optimize the environment for permits, services and development.
Gaochun takes full advantage of the local advantages through its connection to the southern Jiangsu and the southern Anhui area of high-quality tourism to promote the cultural area of the region, which has been fully promoted by the cultural and health sector, and uses the development zone and its position as an international "slow city" as a signpost to intelligent high-end production companies, biomedical and medical technology companies, energy storage and environmental protection, from the cultural and health sector,3 as well as well as companies for ecological agriculture.
Iran-US conflict: Ruhani talks about end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani, after returning from the UN General Assembly, spoke of an alleged offer by the United States to lift sanctions. The United States, in return for talks with Tehran’s leadership, had put an end to all sanctions, Ruhani said on his official website.
US President Donald Trump, however, contradicted Iran’s counterpart via Twitter: “Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed against him so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no.”
Ruhani describes the event as follows: Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and would have urged a meeting to take place. "And America says I lift the sanctions," Ruhani added. The kind of sanctions that should have been put to an end have clearly been up for debate. "And they've been up for debate.
However, this move was not made in an acceptable manner, Ruhani criticized, and given the current sanctions and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure", no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Ruhani in New York. Background was the hope of Europeans to save the nuclear deal with Iran negotiated with Russia and China. This is to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France’s President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel on the margins of the UN General Assembly, expressed the hope that Ruhani will meet with US President Donald Trump.
Severe earthquake near Istanbul - Nearly 200 aftershocks
After Western Turkey was shaken by two earthquakes within a very short time, the fear of disaster is growing. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the quake the previous day, there have been almost 200 aftershocks, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday, thus growing the concern about disaster.
14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons, hundreds of buildings were damaged. The magnitude 5.8 earthquake on Thursday shook the Marmara region in front of Istanbul and sparked panic in the millions metropolis. Now the government wants to deploy a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for quakes, said Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is repeatedly ignored. Every year poorly built homes collapse - among other things, marred by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
City planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open spaces, which were registered as shelters in the center, have long been added. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük earthquake in August, the Istanbul Civil Engineering Chamber had warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake-proof.
The epicenter of the Thursday quake was located in the Marmara Sea in front of the district of Silivri and at about seven kilometers deep, as the Afad Civil Protection Agency reported. A minor aftershock caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said on Twitter that injuries or damage had not been reported at first. TRT showed people who ran out of houses in panic. Students were taken out of the buildings in the district of Silivri for security reasons. Some students were crying, as seen in pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly at risk of earthquakes. Under the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disturbance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian Plates. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the deadliest was the quake in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time more than 17,000 people died.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 to 7.4 could threaten, but when it comes to the earthquake, it is unclear. In the earthquake on Thursday, it hit the west of the country and Istanbul again.
Companies design emergency plans, private individuals have so-called go-bags packed with everything they need to stand next to front doors, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth shakes. When the next big quake comes, it’s unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered minor damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu tracked developments from the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Center (Akom), according to which two minarets of mosques crashed in Avcilar and Sariyer districts.
Warning for aftershocks in Istanbul
On social networks, many users report panic. Buildings were shaking. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines had been interrupted. It had been fiercer than Tuesday, writes a user. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Klinik, warned of aftershocks via Twitter. He called on people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
The time of the quake is reported to be 13:59 a.m. (local time), and just minutes after the first quake, according to CNN Turkey, there was an aftershock that was reported with a magnitude of 4.0 on the Richter scale.
It was not until Tuesday that an earthquake of magnitude 4.6 shook the Turkish Marmara region - it was felt until Istanbul. Its epicenter was also located in the Marmara Sea west of the million-metropole, the disaster protection authority Afad announced on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that caused headlines on Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later there could be a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually discharge - and will cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects that the earthquake is now a warning, and it has become more likely, he told CNN Türk. “These could be the signs of a larger earthquake,” Ersoy told the station.
There had already been an incident a few weeks ago - the quake caused great concern in Istanbul. In Albania, there had only been a severe earthquake a few days ago - there were 68 injured. Also on Lake Constance this year the earth had quaked.
Parliament: New fuel in Ukraine affair
Two explosive documents provide new fuel in the Ukraine affair for possible abuse of power by U.S. President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible impeachment procedure, the U.S. Democrats see themselves strengthened: the complaint filed by an anonymous whistleblower about Trump and its controversial telephone conversation with the Ukrainian President also raises important clues for investigation against the President.
United States: United Airlines passenger detained in toilet - plane diverted
Because a passenger was locked in the board toilet, a United Airlines flight was diverted, and the toilet door was blocked from Washington to San Francisco during the flight in 1554, the airline said.
At an out-of-scheduled stopover on Wednesday evening (local time) in Denver, the woman was finally able to be released from the tight cabin. About an hour she was locked in it, the US media wrote citing other passengers. For further flight to San Francisco, passengers had to change the machine.
In an online video, which is supposed to come from Flight 1554, according to the US media, you can see how several people are trying to free the woman. "We're currently working to open the door, Ma'am. We'll get you out soon, okay?" a man says in it. The airline apologized to all the passengers. Open was initially whether the woman would receive compensation.
The Cockroach: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it – and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka’s famous story “The Transformation,” British successful author Ian McEwan (71) has written a book about the Brexit chaos in the UK.
The novel "Die Kakerlake" (Original: "The Cockroach") will not be published in German on 27 November, the Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) announced. This is about the transformation of a man called "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his earlier life, but is now suddenly the most powerful man in Britain, and he sees it as his mission to keep the will of the people wild.
McEwan was quoted as saying: "If Parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, if ministers lie shamelessly like the Soviet leaders once, when Brexiteers in high positions almost plead the catastrophe of a no-deal - then a writer has to ask himself what he can do. There was only one answer to this: writing."
Kafka’s first published narrative in 1915 is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself “turned into an enormous insect,” is gradually excluded by family and society and eventually perishes. “Ian McEwan bows down to Kafka to describe a world that stands his head,” said Diogenes Verlag.
EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austria’s rail infrastructure
11,200 wagons in Austria and Hungary are given whisper brakes to reduce the noise pollution caused by freight trains, and sections of the train connections between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron are modernised and electrified.
According to the EU authorities, this is intended to make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions. The funds come from the EU infrastructure pot "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All travel cancelled until 31 October
German tour operator Thomas Cook cancelled all trips until 31 October 2019 one day after his insolvency application. Travel could not be started "for reasons of insolvency law", the company said on Thursday evening.
This also affects bookings made by the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, <0xC3><0x96>GER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which have already been paid or paid in full. As regards travel starting from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In coordination with insolvency insurance, the further procedure will be examined, it said.
Thomas Cook in Germany had fallen into the grip of the British parent company and filed for insolvency on Wednesday. The company, which includes Neckermann Reisen, <0xC3><0x96>ger Tours and Bucher Reisen, employs about 2,000 people in Germany.
Insurers now want to transfer money back to hotels
On the other hand, from this Friday, hotels abroad, which currently still host Thomas Cook vacationers, will receive money from the Zurich insurance. The payments to the hotels are linked to the condition that holidaymakers are no longer asked for extra payments.
Based on the booking information and without presenting separate invoices, the hotels in the resorts are now to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesperson for the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and on the condition that Thomas Cook travelers from these hotels are not immediately asked for individual payment of hotel invoices or otherwise required," said spokesman Bernd Engelien.
The insurance company responded to reports from hotel guests who had been forced to pay their own accommodation on the spot, some of whom had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had sharply criticized this.
How many hotels are affected will be matched with the insolvent travel provider on Friday, the insurance spokesman said. According to Thursday, 70,000 Thomas Cook package holidaymakers from Germany were on the way. Zurich Germany has secured holiday and return trip of Thomas Cook customers.
Insolvency administrators want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a future solution.
However, the Zurich insurance only helps travellers who are currently on the road. For Thomas Cook customers who want to fly on holiday, it looks bad. Late Thursday evening, the company announced that all travel until 31 October would be cancelled. This also applies to bookings that have already been paid.
As for travel starting from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In coordination with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure is examined, it said. In principle, the insurance company Zurich is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new trips has stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which can be represented by the company Kaera. Customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website about the possibilities of refunding the travel price and assert their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroys explosives in Angola
For a long time, Prince Harry has continued Lady Diana’s engagement, and now he is walking straight in Africa on the trail of his mother.
Dressed with a blue splinter vest, the British Prince Harry has ignited and destroyed an explosive device in Angola.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust at the town of Dirico on Friday morning, he made the ignition circuit in front of running TV cameras. At a safe distance, the explosive device exploded in the savanna landscape, without causing any damage. Although the Halo Trust alone destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades-long bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1,000 bedrocks.
On the fifth day of his African journey, Harry wanted to walk directly in the city of Huambo on the trail of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same blastmaster who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to take the path that she was going then. The pictures, on which Princess Diana went through a cleared minefield in 1997, had gone around the world. She had also demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a 10-day African tour since Monday, which began in the South African tourist metropolis of Cape Town.
Brexit negotiations: the risk of a no-deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly stated: with him there will be a third postponement of the Brexit negotiations, but there was no guarantee of a permanent EU extension. But what statements are with the polarizing British Johnson. The most recent ruling of the Supreme Court in the UK hovers like a Damocles sword above the Blondhead. Its suspension of the parliament, in order to be able to carry out a Brexit course until the beginning of the week, and it was able to carry out a week.
Boris Johnson thinks deal is still possible
However, the pressure does not seem to pass Johnson noticeably, and in the meantime, when he visited a hospital, he made indications that he would support an extension of the negotiations in the event of a failure to reach an agreement by the end of October:
You know, we're gonna stick to the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU by 31 October.
And best of all, with a deal, I'm cautiously optimistic that this will work.
And the time is running out of time for Brexit negotiators in Brussels. Somehow, the EU and British negotiators may still have time to prevent Britain’s exit from the European Union without agreement. But even recent talks have not made a breakthrough again. An agreement until the end of October seems to be rather difficult at the moment. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, but the word is not in force.
U.S. authorities: Further deaths from e-cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the U.S. has increased to twelve. In addition, there are now 805 confirmed and likely injured in this regard, the U.S. Health Authority CDC said. A study in the "New England Journal of Medicine" found that there were already more than 900 people affected, similar to 500 of them. The cause of the lung damage is still completely unknown to the U.S.
The fear of new protests in Egypt is growing
Mohammed Ali’s videos have been shared millions of times in online networks. Spain’s construction company and actor are calling for a “people’s revolution.” For today’s Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, which critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement. Ali hopes for mass demonstrations with a million participants in central squares of the country.
The security authorities are in any case alarmed. In the center of Cairo there was already an increased police presence. Several subway stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir Square were closed. Already in recent days the police had reinforced their street controls and the phones of pedestrians partially searched for news and photos related to the protests.
On September 20, the protesters also gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura came to protests with hundreds of participants. Such an open protest had not occurred in Egypt for years. Correspondingly, the security forces reacted harshly to it. According to the Human Rights Watch (HRW) human rights organization, nearly 2,000 people were arrested since last week. Many of them were arbitrarily arrested in the wrong place – only because they “were wrongly arrested” in the wrong time.
The organization also criticized the censorship in the North African country, according to which the government in Cairo blocked websites and online services to stop further protests against al-Sisi. The general ruled the country since 2013 after he had overthrown democratically elected Islamist President Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been imprisoned and partially convicted in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs from Greenland expedition back
The polar explorer Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday and was welcomed on his arrival at the port of Hamburg by skipper Boris Herrmann, who had brought climate activist Greta Thunberg over the Atlantic with the race yacht "Malizia".
With a team of scientists, Fuchs had investigated and documented the consequences of global warming on his sailing ship Dagmar Aaen on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland in recent months.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the polar scientist. He waited years for the young generation to speak up. It has been known for decades that the Earth is warming. Yet many acted as if there was a planet B.
“What happens on the sea often takes place under the exclusion of the public,” said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the pollution of the seas. Among other things, the expedition was measured with a drone of Greenlandic glacier ice and fished with nets for microplastics, it said.
For his "fight for a sustainable and respectful use of the world's oceans", the polar explorer from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" during the Hamburg Climate Week. "For all of us who care about the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great example," said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony.
Expensive Spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid 430 euros for pasta
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near the Engelsburg in Rome: This seemed to be too much. The bill included 80 euros tipping was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered heated reactions.
"Such cases are damaging to the reputation of Rome. We call on the police to investigate whether this is a fraud," a spokesman for Federagit, the Association of Travel Guides in Rome, told the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday issue).
Prompt came the reaction of the owners of the restaurant. The Japanese had ordered not only spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the local owner justified himself. However, this is not to be taken from the invoice. Also a tip of up to 20 percent of the invoice is normal, the host said.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump could actually face an impeachment procedure after the turbulent revelations of the past few days, the Democrats now want to check that with their investigation in the House of Representatives as soon as possible - the speech is from weeks until a decision would be made.
At the beginning of the scandal is supposedly the phone call with Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selensky. The accusation of the whistleblower, who ultimately brought the conversation to the public with his complaint out of concern for national security and for the democracy of the United States, is monstrous: the president has abused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country for influencing the 2020 election.
The core of this project is also to be seen in the now-published caption of the conversation with Selensky, although it does not reflect the full text. However, the July 25 phone call is just an episode of a much larger story, in which the center of which stands next to Trump above all his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story begins from the public's point of view in May 2019 when the New York Times reported on Rudy Giuliani's travel plans to Ukraine very helpfully - he wants to meet his government in Kiev with just-elected President Selensky, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. "We don't interfere in a election, we don't want to interfere in an investigation, but what we have the right to do is," he told the newspaper.
The lawyer and former New York mayor seem to have been infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies fixed on Trump’s opponent candidate in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time, to construct an occasion for Russia’s investigations in the US, but this accusation was never to be taken seriously.
This is precisely the investigation that Trump will be so prominently talking about on the phone with Selenskyj in July. The version of the former Vice President and currently prospective candidate for the Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, has been the Ukraine representative of the Obama administration on the dismissal of his then Ukrainian Attorney General, Wiktor, who was the former Ukrainian Attorney General.
In fact, the process was somewhat different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian Attorney General go, the investigation against the gas company was already completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected. Schokin himself was accused of deeply corrupt gestures, the U.S. government was by far not the only Western partner pushing for his dismissal. Moreover, the Obama administration explicitly supported the investigation against the Obama administration.
Disruptions on Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disruptions on Instagram and Facebook. Accordingly, mainly Germany, the UK and Spain are affected. On the website allestörungen.de, users report that Facebook has not been loading again and again since about 3.30 p.m. Also Instagram reports the error message that content could not be loaded. Also Whatsapp seems affected by the disruption, although not to the same extent so far.
Instagram and Co. are more often affected by disruptions
It’s not the first massive crash this year. Already in March and July, the services had failed for several hours. And as in the previous cases, users also use Twitter this time especially to air their anger.
Polish scientists rescued in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been rescued by the Chilean Air Force from the ice of Antarctica. They were traveling with a inflatable boat and several miles from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the accident - less than an hour needed the Chilean rescue helicopter for the rescue.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9:30 a.m. we got the message, at just ten we started, and good 20 minutes later we were over the inflatable".
Poland operates on King George Island since 1977 the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station, 19 scientists working there. The frozen researchers were safely brought back to their research station.
Attention: Smartphone NIE wireless charging
Practical, but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since several new smartphones have recently come onto the market, which support wireless charging and sell very well - above all the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July. The wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely convenient, but not absolutely recommended.
Higher temperature increases battery
In addition, researchers warn against wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the Univerity of Warwick, this is extremely harmful for the devices. The reason for this is the significantly greater heat consumption. If you charge a mobile phone normally via cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. In the case of wireless charging, the researchers have also measured the battery in the charging pad at a perfect orientation, which also increases the temperature. If the mobile phone slightly in addition to the battery, the battery is increased.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature for the durability of batteries is a decisive factor. Because every single degree plays a role. When charging at higher temperatures, the battery not only loses capacity, but also does not last as long. The overall life is lower. Therefore, the researchers advise to always charge the smartphone via cable. Since a battery exchange on modern smartphones is always associated with high costs, this is probably a helpful tip for Apple.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient: simply place the device on a corresponding charging pad - these are already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without annoying cable salad and tedious plug fumble. Since Qi (stands for inductive energy transmission) is a worldwide standard, with the exception of Apple, there are hardly any exceptions.
Everest stock photographer: 13 eight-thousands in six months
A Nepalese climber has climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world in just six months. Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal and thus set a record, his expedition organiser said.
The former soldier wants to climb every 14 eight thousand in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He made international headlines. From him comes a photo of mountaineers who are standing on Mount Everest snake in the spring.
The image of mass attendance sparked a debate about stronger security measures on the 8848-metre-high mountain and highest summit of the Earth. In May, eleven climbers had died at the ascent within a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the ascent of the 14th eight-thousandths: Chinese authorities are currently blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. Among other reasons, bad weather is mentioned. Earlier this week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal’s government wants to talk to China to allow it to ascend.
Four dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals is also a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman said on Friday, "We suspect that the elephants were poisoned".
The four carcasses were found in a protected area near the famous and visited by many tourists former rock fortress Sigiriya. The animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old, according to the police spokesman. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed every year. The perpetrators are often farmers, on whose land the animals had previously held harmless. At the same time, around 50 people are killed by elephants every year. This usually happens when the animals move through villages built near their habitat.
According to estimates, only 7,000 elephants live in Sri Lanka, and the death penalty is theoretically on their killings.
British oil tankers leave Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after its capture by Iran, according to the IRNA news agency. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had determined the tanker flying the British flag on July 19 with the accusation of disregarding provisions of maritime law in the Persian Gulf.
Thomas Cook's Management in Criticism
The relevant economic committee of the House of Commons wants to examine the plight of the travel giant Thomas Cook in detail, as well as the salary packages of the board of directors, as well as the question of why the British government did not want to give financial support to the companies fighting for survival. "Our interest is in the supervision of the company as well as in the control of external accountants," the committee chairman Rachel Reeves said in a statement.
According to experts, genes are overestimated at the risk of colorectal cancer
The role of genes in familial increased risk of colorectal cancer has apparently been overestimated so far. To this end, researchers from the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg come in a recent study. Other risk factors such as familial dietary habits probably weigh more heavily than previously assumed. This has consequences for calculations of individual colorectal cancer risk, the DKFZ scientists emphasize.
Elon Musk to increase Tesla stock
Musk wrote this in an email to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog "Electrek". The demand was strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, according to Musk's circular.
The challenge is to get the cars to customers quickly, and Tesla will have to provide as much resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla’s shares went out of business with an increase of over 6%. The price has not increased for nearly four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered a good 95,000 cars and thus reached its best value so far.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 36,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers need to be produced in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
Will the UK government bypass Brexit law? Johnson reluctantly
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is keeping a close eye on whether he is looking for ways to circumvent the last law against an unregulated Brexit passed by parliament. On a similar question, he just told journalists on Friday that his government will abide by current law.
The law stipulates that the government must apply for a postponement of the exit date if no agreement with the EU was reached by mid-October, and Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law" that makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law, and that Johnson could use a procedural trick that would delay the entry into force of the law until after the EU exit.
Johnson said he was aiming for a deal with the European Union, "We are confident that we will leave the EU on October 31, and the best way is through an agreement."
Iran is likely to increase uranium enrichment
Iran’s President Hassan Rohani has increased pressure on the European contracting parties in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear deal. “Unfortunately, the European states show inability or lack of willingness when it comes to concrete actions,” Rohani said at a press conference on Thursday at the edge of the UN General Assembly in New York. In the event that they were not in line with their promise, he put “further steps” away from the 2015 agreement.
The background is the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which in return contained a commitment to Tehran to normalize economic relations. The US unilaterally stepped out of the agreement in 2018 to force Iran to change course with “maximum pressure” in the deemed aggressive Middle East policy. President Donald Trump’s government wants a new agreement with tougher conditions in Iran.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic is now using or at least preparing for use the centrifuges installed at the beginning of September, and that according to the IAEA, Iran is also preparing to build more than 300 more centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans are not ready to carry their share of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the cost and burden of oppressive US sanctions, Rohani alleged, but there will still be further talks that hopefully will bring a solution.
Rohani continues to deny Iran’s involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, the mixed situation has changed after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September: Germany, France and the United Kingdom followed on Monday the US assessment that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Iranian-backed Huthi rebels in Yemen had known about the attack, but this was deemed by the US to be a false confession.
“Those who are making such accusations must provide evidence,” said Mr. Johnson, but the European leaders could not have done so in the talks with him during the UN general debate. Instead, they would only have relied on the rebels in Yemen not to carry out an attack like this. Mr. Macron had met with Chancellor Angela France in recent days.
Before possible talks with US President Trump, the far-reaching sanctions of the US administration would have to be lifted, Rohani demanded, calling on the government in Washington to switch to a policy of “dialogue and reason.”
Comet of other star intersects solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of space, which was first achieved by allowing the comet to draw conclusions about other solar systems.
What was initially just a guess is now confirmed: An interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depths of space was named after its discoverer on 2I/Borisov and has awakened the interest of astronomers all over the world.
The far-flung comet was discovered on August 30 by amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimeters in diameter. Observations from various observatories not only confirmed that it is an unknown comet, but also showed that it is not from our solar system.
2I/Borisov, after 1I/'Oumuamua of 2017, is only the second interstellar object seen during a transit of our solar system.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get close-up insights into a foreign solar system before it disappears into oblivion. Initial observations show that the interstellar comet resembles those of our own system, as the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands reported. "The present speed of a comet is significantly higher, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is the distance of the comet.
According to the analysis, the comet is on the way on a so-called hyperbolic orbit, which detects it from our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as announced by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). It is also responsible for the designation and categorization of celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar tail star, which was initially named after it under catalog number C/2019 Q4, was given the first name of the interstellar tail star.
Astronomers are lucky: In contrast to 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been spotted in the approach, leaving the researchers many months to investigate. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," Farnocchia explained. "Then it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes by October 2020."
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor. Thus, a team around Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, determined in a first investigation the diameter of the celestial object to 2 to 16 kilometers. Photographs of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a distinct tail of the comet.
Researchers from the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already gained a first so-called spectrum from the interstellar tail star, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to that of comets of our solar system, and this indicates that their composition must be similar," said IAC researcher Julia de Le<0xC3><0xB3>n.
The discovery of just two interstellar visitors within just two years indicates, according to the IAU, that these objects could open a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, how common such tipping sights are is still difficult to estimate. One of the next interstellar visitors could potentially intercept a planned satellite mission from the European space agency Esa.
According to Esa Science Director Günther Hasinger, the three-part space probe "Comet Interceptor" (German, for example, comet interceptor) is to be stationed at a waiting position 1.5 million kilometres from Earth by 2028, either on an untouched, fresh comet from our own solar system, or on an interstellar visitor such as 1I/O'um.
First landing on Beijing's new mega-airport Daxing
Just before the 70th birthday of the People’s Republic of China, it’s time: At the new mega-airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a first passenger machine from China United Airlines has landed, a special honor for captain and crew.
By 2022, around 45 million passengers will be handled annually at the new airport, and by 2025, it will already be 72 million. China’s President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion expensive project. China’s latest prestige project is also called “Seasters” because of its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four runways to be expanded to seven and is equipped with the world’s largest automatic air traffic management system. A new subway transports passengers to downtown Beijing in just 20 minutes.
Already during the construction, the Chinese had repeatedly announced that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been under construction since 2006, has so far been postponed. In Beijing, on the other hand, after four years, a first passenger machine landed.
New supersonic aircraft to fly in 2030: in four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - of which the British space agency UK Space Agency is dreaming. The company's mission in 2030 is to make this supersonic-powered flight a special drive (Synergetic Air-breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre) that the company is developing Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, the U.S. broadcaster CNN quoted the agency as saying.
In order to advance the project, the British space agency wants to cooperate more closely with the Australian development of the past. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis has also been known as a flight to the United States of America. The Concorde had covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 to the end of its operation in 2003 and took three to three and a half hours to complete the operation in 2000. In 2000, it came to an accident at the start of a Concorde in Paris.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," Reaction Engines writes on his homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at Mach 5 speed - that means five times as fast as the sound. In addition, such aircraft can also be used outside the Earth's atmosphere, enabling the "next generation of real-world re-usable devices".
Washington riot: Trump wants to track down anonymous tippers in Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair over possible abuse of power by the US president, Donald Trump wants to track down potential leaks in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information," Trump told U.S. embassy staff at the United Nations in New York on Thursday. The person concerned was almost "a spy" and with these people in the past "a little different" than today.
This was considered an intimidation attempt against tippers. The event was not actually public. However, several U.S. media outlets spread audio recordings of the address on Friday. Democrats reacted emphatically to the president’s statement.
Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday announced preparations for an impeachment procedure against Trump. Their accusations are based primarily on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence officer who makes heavy accusations against Trump and his government headquarters. The whistleblower’s statements were made public on Thursday, according to large public pressure.
As part of his work, the whistleblower wants to have received information from several government employees that the US president “uses the power of his office” to achieve that another country interferes in his favor in the 2020 U.S. election.
At the heart of the allegations is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selensky at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his counterpart to investigate which could harm his political rival Joe Biden, dealing with previous affairs of Biden’s son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his opponent from the Ukrainian judiciary.
The whistleblower also accused the White House of concealment in view of the Ukraine phone call: leading government officials had made an effort to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the cover. As usual, an electronic wording protocol was only made. This was, after the conversation, specially reserved in a database, but was removed from the White House by an order of lawyers.
The New York Times reported that it was an employee of the CIA's foreign intelligence agency.
Trump again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of tweets on the topic, the president wrote, among other things, that the “so-called whistleblower” had disseminated second-hand information that turned out to be incorrect. Therefore, there might be no tippers or spies at all.
As Trump expressed in New York on those who were supposed to have given information to the whistleblower, however, outrage triggered. The president of the U.S. House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, reacted alarmedly and lamented that Trump’s statement once again undermined the integrity of the government.
In the House of Representatives, various investigations against Trump and his environment have been ongoing for months in various committees, and in the face of the Ukraine allegations, the Democrats are now pushing forward with new momentum to initiate a possible impeachment procedure against Trump.
“The whistleblower gave us a roadmap for our investigation,” said Adam Schiff, the head of the Intelligence Committee at the House of Representatives. Trump attacked Schiff sharply, accused him of misrepresenting things, and once again called for the resignation of the chairman of the committee. Trump regularly insulted Schiff and had already demanded his withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. government officials from the security and foreign policy sectors, who were mostly working under democratic but also Republican presidents, stood behind Trump’s investigation into possible impeachment proceedings in a statement released Friday. If the allegations were true, it would be “a ruthless abuse of power” by Trump, it said.
There is no precise timetable for the further procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could make a so-called impeachment procedure. However, the decision on an actual impeachment was made in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success of such a procedure are therefore low. So far, no U.S. president has been appointed by an impeachment procedure of the office.
VW Works Council: Jobs are being dismantled "swimmingly"
The VW brand’s plans to further reduce costs in production could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe. This concern is driving the automaker’s works council around. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs from ten billion euros to two billion euros by 2023, of which 500 million euros will be saved already this year.
The "future pact" negotiated between the company and the works council in 2016 already envisages the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone. Basically, a job can only be reduced by the car manufacturer if it is proven that the related activities are no longer necessary. In addition, employment protection is valid until 2029.
However, as our newspaper has now learned from works councils, jobs in production that are not actually at the disposal are “swimming” down by another way – that is to say, by the official course. Thus, free-coming regular jobs would often not be reoccupied.
In these cases, the works council has no way of forcing the re-occupation. Meanwhile, there is a lack of employment in many parts of the country, the labour pressure is increasing, the concerns about the gradual bleeding of the vehicle plants are increasing. This also increases the fear that vehicle production could only be gradually withdrawn from Germany and Europe, because it is cheaper to do so in other parts of the world.
The VW brand wants to standardise production worldwide even more and centrally manage new projects. This will also reduce costs and speed up decisions - this is the goal of increasing productivity and thus competitiveness. Production director Andreas Tostmann said at a management conference in Berlin: "In uncertain times from Brexit to the impending trade war between the US and China, we are well advised to make ourselves crisis-proof".
In this way, there are already successes: for example, production costs per vehicle would fall for the first time since 2013 compared to the previous year. Before journalists, Tostmann said that the production time for the Golf 8, which is to be presented in Wolfsburg on 24 October, will be shortened by 1.1 hours. Exact figures for the production period do not mention VW, according to information from our newspaper, it is about 7 hours.
20 hours.
In our region, the Wolfsburg plant is the only VW plant in which exhaust gases are produced. The Braunschweig and Salzgitter plants produce components. For Wolfsburg, the rule of thumb applies to the fact that 800,000 cars have to be built there every year, so that the plant is satisfactorily profitable. In 2018, however, the utilization in Wolfsburg was only 700,000 vehicles – due to the sinking of diesel and the problems caused by the sinking of the wind turbine.
However, as production director Tostmann has already announced last year, "perspectively" one million cars are to roll off the band in Wolfsburg, which is intended to make possible the bundling of golf production in the main plant - because the Zwickau plant is to hand over the golf production through the conversion to the location for e-car production.
In Wolfsburg, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are also produced. However, the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan have recently declined. Therefore, expectations now rest on Golf 8. He is to remain the bread-and-butter car of Wolfsburger for the time being, despite all the efforts to build e-mobility.
Voodoo Forced to Prostitution: Traffickers Sentenced
Young women from Nigeria have been charged with injuring, dragged into the Ruhr and forced into prostitution, and six suspected human traffickers have to go to jail for doing so.
Six suspected Nigerian traffickers were sentenced to eight years and three months in prison in Bochum on Friday. The defendants had dragged young women from Nigeria into the Ruhr area and forced them to prostitution. In order to enforce their obedience, the outgoing Nigerians still had a ritual vow in front of a Voodoo priest in their home country.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought in inflatable boats across the Mediterranean with the help of Libyan locksmiths. However, the dream of a better future was not fulfilled. When they arrived in Germany, they were distributed to different brothels to process the alleged locksmith costs of an average of 25 000 euros. The wages were therefore completely deducted from them.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the insertion and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerians on brothels in the trial. "The work made it physically and mentally difficult for women to create," Judge Isabel Hoffmann said in the verdict. "Some were properly opposed."
The rulings are based on commercial and gang-like incarceration of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, pimping and heavy forced prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIm’s ongoing dispute with the Lufthansa Group has again threatened with strikes by the flight attendant trade union Ufo.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the union "will inform on 14 October about the labour force measures in the LH Group," Ufo tariff chief Daniel Flohr said on Friday. Lufthansa and its subsidiary Eurowings have been refusing to negotiate with the Ufo tariff negotiations for months, including whether the trade union has legally terminated collective agreements with Lufthansa.
In this respect, Ufo now sees itself strengthened after a decision of the Frankfurt Labour Court. Lufthansa wanted to make it clear that the collective agreements were not terminated. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and is considering bringing proceedings against it. "That a second court sees the matter completely differently, I consider it unlikely," said Ufo board member Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa filed an application with the Frankfurt Regional Labour Court to have the status of UFO as a trade union legally verified. The company argues that the trade union has not used a representative board for months and is thus unable to fulfil its role as a collective bargaining partner.
It was preceded by a fierce leadership dispute in the divisional union, during which numerous members of the board and the advisory board resigned, including long-time union leader Nicoley Baublies. The UFO had suspended a pre-arranged vote on strikes by the cabin crew at Eurowings at the end of July due to doubts about their leadership.
Facilitated entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
Until now, Saudi Arabia was not exactly known as an international tourist magnet, but that is to change now. The country on the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, it wants to increase the number of international and domestic visitors to 100 million per year, the Tourism Commission said.
“The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a one-historical moment for our country,” said Ahmad Al-Chatib, chairman of the Tourism Commission.
Saudi Arabia has so far been difficult to access for tourists. Visas are usually only issued for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the arch-conservative Kingdom hopes to increase revenues from the tourism business. According to its own statement, Riyadh wants to reduce its dependence on oil trade.
By mid-September, several rockets and drones had hit two of the most important oil facilities in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country’s largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churai oil field. In the aftermath, national oil production drastically broke down, the oil price spikes had risen. It should take several weeks for the kingdom’s oil production to reach its old level again.
Justin and Hailey Bieber Get Prepared for Wedding Party
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding party. The model posted several party photos in her Instagram stories on Thursday (local time) where she can be seen in the white wedding look. Reality star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized a bachelor party in Los Angeles, according to People magazine.
Justin posted several colorful, banana-printed suits on Instagram and asked his followers: "Help me choose my smoking for the wedding". According to media reports, the celebrity couple wants to marry church next weekend.
A year ago, the Biebers gave themselves the “yes” word in a New York State Office, and there was no big party at that time.
In an interview with Vogue Australia, Hailey recently stated that after initial problems, the two had found a common level: “If you don’t want to compromise, you can’t have a relationship.”
Two dead in plane crash in Czech Republic
Two people were killed in the crash of a small plane in the west of the Czech Republic. The wreck was discovered on Friday in a wooded area near the town of Mecin (Metchin), the police said. The dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been searching for the machine since Thursday evening, after the crew had sent an emergency signal via GPS. During the search, a military helicopter was also in use. The cause of the accident still needs to be determined. The crash site is located about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (places) and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of European tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, unsustainable logging and the growth of cities are also the cause of the threat, the IUCN World Conservation Union reported on Friday in Brussels, examining the holdings of all 454 tree species known in Europe, 265 of which do not occur on any other continent. Of these 265, 58% are threatened. 66 are already at the highest level of the threat, and 66 are already at the highest level of the threat.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "potentially endangered", "highly endangered", "threatened from extinction" and "extinct" to "extinct" and lists more than 28,000 species of animals and plants worldwide as endangered.
Eberese and wild horse chestnut threatened
In Germany, especially Ebereschen (Sorbus) is threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, of the German Press Agency. "Most are threatened because the populations are small anyway or because of the transformation or weakening of their habitats".
It also looks bad for the wild Common Horse chestnuts. They have been considered as "at risk" since 2017, level two of the IUCN scale. The biggest threat is in addition to a fungus, the Balkan miner's moth. It has spread from south-eastern Europe across the continent since the 1980s and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild horse chestnuts in the park (A)
Shrubs and moose are also at risk
At the same time, the IUCN scientists created new European Red Lists for molluscs, shrubs and moss. More than one-fifth of molluscs and moss and almost half of all shrub species are threatened, according to the IUCN. This is mainly due to the destruction of the wild, of introduced birds, agricultural practices and climate change.
“This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet,” said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Office.
Istanbul earthquake: 34 injured
Turkey’s most recent earthquake injured 34 people, and there were no deaths, according to reports. Dozens of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings have been damaged, and since the quake the day before, there have been almost 200 aftershocks. The magnitude 5.8 earthquake shook the Marmara region off Istanbul on Thursday, sparking panic in the millions metropolis.
Now the government wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced. In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for quakes, said Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Under the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disturbance, which marks the boundary between the Eurasian and Anatolian Plates.
One of the most severe quakes was one of the magnitude 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was then located in Gölcük southeast of Istanbul. More than 17,000 people died.
Already on Tuesday, a magnitude 4.6 quake had rocked the region around Istanbul, prompting residents to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira perform in the half-time show
Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the half-time show of the next American football final Super Bowl. That’s what the singers announced on Twitter. “It won’t be great,” Shakira wrote to a photo of herself and Lopez. She’s excited to be on the Super Bowl stage so far. On February 2, 2020, it will be in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez said she had been dreaming of performing at the Super Bowl since 1996 – then she saw Diana Ross flying to the skies at the half-time show. “Now it’s even more special because the NFL is 100 years old and I’m going to perform with another Latina,” she said.
Shakira pointed out in a statement that she felt honored to be on one of the biggest stages in the world alongside another artist and to represent Latinos and Latinas from the US and around the world. "And then on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it was the first time that the two "queen" were together on a stage.
Shakira is from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents are from Puerto Rico.
Fight against declining audience numbers
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the half-time show are among the most watched TV broadcasts in the U.S. Even if you’ve recently dropped viewership numbers: this February, the spectacle attracted the fewest viewers in the U.S. for more than ten years. Nevertheless, there were still almost one hundred million people on average.
For the half-time show of the past Super Bowl, there had been riots in the run-up to the game: In the fight to deal with quarterback Colin Kaepernick last February, media reports said top stars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to appear. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 led the half-time show - the reviews were not very friendly.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, had not gone to his knees in the 2016/17 season before NFL games at the National Anthem for protesting police violence and racism. With his protest, Kaepernick triggered a movement, numerous players took over the gesture. This caused great excitement, US President Donald Trump attacked the most African-American football stars in March, and Kaenick himself has been sharp since 2017.
Cook Pleite: hotels get money from insurance
Some banks are likely to face the plight of travel provider Thomas Cook, according to a press release. There are high write-offs on outstanding bonds and loans. Credit Suisse is also affected, writes the "Financial Times" in its issue of Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse would have to make a total write-down of up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.8 billion (around €2 billion) on their books, according to the report.
The creditors of bonds would have to purchase depreciations of <0xC2><0xA3>900 million to <0xC2><0xA3>1 billion and the lenders between <0xC2><0xA3>550 and <0xC2><0xA3>825 million.
The extent to which the creditors’ losses will be in the end will be apparent after the insolvency proceedings have ended. A person close to this procedure did not give too much hope. For example, the around 40 Thomas Cook aircraft in the UK are “old” and many of the properties are in bad locations. Most of the money could be recovered with the sale of the airport slots and the Thomas Cook brand, it said.
Rackete reportedly brought alleged killers to Italy
Sea-Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who are said to have tortured and killed people in Libya. “We can’t rule this out, but we don’t have any secure information about it ourselves,” said Sea-Watch spokesman Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants had recognized the three men in Italy. They are accused of raping, torture and killing people in Libya. The alleged perpetrators were arrested in the reception camp in Messina, Italy. Neubauer stressed that the refugee organizations could not check who they left on their ships. "They come without passports".
Carola Rackete had illegally taken migrants to the port of Lampedusa on 29 June and rammed a ship from the Italian financial police. On that day, the three suspects were also reported to have arrived there. The captain is investigating for aid to illegal immigration.
U.S. warns federal government of Huawei
The head of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government to trust the Chinese network equipment company Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too great,” Pai told the “Handelsblatt” with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a “national security law” that obliges any company “under Chinese jurisdiction” to follow instructions from the security agencies.
The applicable law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests," the FCC chief said, making it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
In the meantime, the German government has agreed to require suppliers to provide a “certificate of confidentiality”.
Berlin wants to first try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "Handelsblatt" citing its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology does not consist only of the hardware:
The software in particular is important to keep the devices up to date, which consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time," Pai said.
It is “very difficult to imagine” that a government agency, “no matter where, would be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks,” continued the FCC chief.
He accuses the Chinese company Huawei of making close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The employee company, which allegedly owns the company, is not necessarily independent of the government,” Pai told Handelsblatt.
The U.S. has provided evidence that government employees have been placed within the company, and Pai has recently been in Berlin for talks to promote the position of the U.S.
Chemical plant in northern France burns: schools closed
During the night, locals hear explosions. A giant fire wall illuminates the sky over a northern French chemical plant. The fire is extinguished after hours - but the clean-up work could now take days.
After a fire at a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, the schools and children's cribs in the region remain closed.
In twelve municipalities, the facilities would not open on Friday, the responsible prefecture said. The Ministry of the Interior had asked the citizens to stay as far as possible in buildings and not to expose themselves to the smoke. The injured were not there. Farmers and breeders were called to bring their animals indoors, protect their food and stop the harvest for the time being.
The fire was completely extinguished on Thursday evening, according to the prefecture. There is still a risk that after the removal smell will spread, according to the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firefighters and 90 police officers and gendarmes were in use at the fire site.
A giant black smoke column had previously emerged from the chemical plant. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the factory of Lubrizol, which produces additives for oils. The production facility is located a few kilometers from the city centre.
The factory in Normandy, according to authorities, belongs to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous sites, which are particularly monitored. In the Italian Seveso near Milan, a devastating chemical accident occurred in 1976.
The prefect of the Normandy region, Pierre-André Durand, told the news station BFMTV that no "high toxicity" was initially detected in samples. However, contamination of the nearby Seine could not be excluded. In the river dams were built against pollution, the prefect explained.
The fire broke out early in the morning around 2:40 a.m., the authorities reported. The cause remained unclear at first. Rouen is a regional metropolis and is located on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Finance Minister: “Germany must invest now”
French Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to make greater investments to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany needs to invest now, the sooner the better," Le Maire said at the presentation of the French budget for the coming year.
The economy in the eurozone is weakening, the minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation worsens in order to make the necessary decisions."
Those countries that have room for more investment should act, Le Maire said, among other things, with a view to Germany.
France does not have these leeway, the minister added, referring to the high state debt of its country, which is more than 98 percent of the gross domestic product. The French state debt must be "stabilized" and "reduced," Le Maire said.
In recent years, appeals from France have repeatedly come to Germany to make more public investments in order to revive the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly called on France to get its budget deficit under control.
The French budget for 2020, presented on Thursday, provides tax relief of more than €9 billion for households.
Among other things, the French government is responding to the protests of the Yellow Vest movement, which is expected to fall to 2.2 per cent, according to 3.1 per cent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson rejects question about Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson strongly criticizes the “capitulation law” passed by parliament.
Parliament is back, a law requires the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos Brexit, but critics fear that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole, but the Tory politician denies this possibility.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is covering himself up about whether he wants to enforce an unregulated Brexit - despite the last law passed by parliament, which is supposed to prevent that. On a corresponding question, Johnson told journalists only that his government will abide by current law.
The law stipulates that the government should apply for a postponement of the exit date should no agreement be reached with the EU by mid-October, and Johnson criticizes this as a “capitulation law” that makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedural trick that would postpone the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU's withdrawal. Johnson said he is seeking a deal with the European Union. "We are confident that we will leave the EU on October 31st, and we are confident that we will be able to leave the EU with the best way forward."
Johnson's chief adviser Dominic Cummings, meanwhile, stated that he felt the political clashes surrounding Brexit as "walking in the park" and was confident that the intended EU exit would still come about: "We will enjoy it, we will win, we will (remember Red: leaving the EU), no worries," said Cummings to the British newspaper.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign “Vote Leave” during the 2016 election campaign before the EU referendum, is now acting as chief strategist in the UK’s Downing Street government seat and is said to be behind the uncompromising policy that has led the Prime Minister into a virtually impossible situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the very big rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the big glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (bags) dives deep into the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 until Linda's death in 1998, was visibly proud and touched when he presented the picture book "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, including Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders frontwoman Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote on Instagram: “#ThePolaroidDiaries is a fleeting look into the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration of LindaMcCartney’s legacy as a committed artist and the instant magic of the Polaroid film.”
With Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids have made it, a few hundred of which are now published in "The Polaroid Diaries" for the first time.
These are portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "She wanted real moments," writes art critic Ekow Eshun in his foreword. And of course, one is always the focus: her husband Paul - as you may never have seen him before.
Then he dances with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, telephoned in the bathrobe with a bag on his head or wearing unshaped moonboots. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but they also led a normal life beyond the headlight on their farm in southern England or Scotland. Soraum Mary McCartney said that she had not slept in a bed as a baby.
Like hardly any other medium, the Poloraid camera captures the immediate moment. The footage of Linda McCartney is certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than pure snapshots.
It’s about deciding click: You have to recognize when a great photo happens in front of you. And then you have to snap it at exactly the right moment,” Paul McCartney said. “If you snap two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo.” And Linda would have had the gift of always capturing exactly the right moment. “She just knew she has it,” Paul said in the Eshun-E.
There the light, the composition, the cut-out and the colors are right, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but also a great aesthetic pleasure in addition to everything anecdotal, where landscapes sometimes look like abstract paintings. The perfect addition to the newly released Beatles album "Abbey Road" appeared exactly 50 years ago.
“We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran.”
Turkey wants to continue importing oil and gas from neighbouring countries despite the US sanctions imposed against Iran. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview released on Friday that Turkey could not stop oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there,” Erdogan said in New York, where he attended the UN General Assembly.
Erdogan, however, admitted that Turkey was having problems importing Iranian oil, as some companies had “retired because of the US threats.”
Nevertheless, Turkey “will continue our relations with Iran, especially on this issue and on many other issues,” said the Turkish president, who had repeatedly criticized US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The United States has been pursuing a policy of “maximum pressure” against the Islamic Republic since its withdrawal from the international nuclear agreement with Iran. According to the United States, Iran is secretly pursuing a nuclear program and does not adhere to the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran, and tensions in the Gulf region have increased significantly in recent months.
U.S. government wants to restrict the reception of refugees
The U.S. government wants to drastically restrict the admission of refugees. The U.S. State Department said on Thursday that the annual ceiling of a resettlement program should be lowered from currently 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, which corresponds to an average of 40 percent.
The State Department said the US would continue to be committed to supporting refugees, but the most important task is to protect and serve US citizens. Currently, the US immigration system is overloaded.
The U.S. government wants to focus on the admission of two refugee groups in the future: people who are being persecuted for their faith – and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are at risk as a result of this, according to the statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, while from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador a maximum of 1,500 refugees are to be admitted.
The programme, launched in 1980, selects refugees from UN camps around the world and resettles them in the US. The upper limit of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the history of the programme. Even the current upper limit of 30,000 is a low value. When the predecessor of US President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, left the White House, the number was close to 85,000.
“This is a very sad day for America,” said David Miliband, the head of the International Rescue Committee, in which the US would continue to damage its leadership role in protecting the world’s most vulnerable people.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration into the U.S. - legally as well as illegally. The U.S. government expects 350,000 asylum applications for the coming financial year. These figures are separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump: “Getting Close to a Spitzl”
U.S. President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers of espionage in the whistleblower affair. Whoever gave the informant, who accuses him of abuse of power, "comes close to a spike," Trump said, according to a private event on Thursday in New York.
Trump then spoke to staff members of the U.N. mission. When asked about the person who informed whistleblower about controversial events in the White House, he replied, "This is coming close to a spike". Then Trump added, "Do you know what we did in the old days when we were smart? Right. The spies and betrayals we used to do a bit differently now."
Observers evaluated the latter remark for a possible allusion to the death penalty. Democrats sharply criticized Trump’s statements and accused him of intimidating witnesses. It was also an attempt to obstruct a congressional investigation into a possible impeachment procedure against him, wrote the chairmen of the Committees on Foreign Affairs, Secret Service,
The whistleblower accuses the president of having abused his office in order to ask for interference from another country in the 2020 U.S. election. Specifically, it is about his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Wolodymyr Selenskyj in the summer: in the conversation, Trump suggested to him that he should investigate his possible democratic challenge to the U.S., and that he should not be allowed to do so.
It is still unclear who both the whistleblower himself and his informants are, but as the New York Times reports, the whistleblower is supposed to be an analyst for the CIA’s foreign intelligence agency.
Refugee boat spotted: baby and toddlers drown in Aegean Sea
Time and again, people are trying to get from Turkey to Greece via the Aegean Sea, where they regularly know the boats that are often far too small. At the end of a tubular boat, seven migrants have now died, including five children.
In front of the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants were killed in the sinking of a inflatable boat, including a baby and four other children, the Greek Coast Guard reported. Four children, three women and five men were rescued from the floods by the crew of a passing ferry.
Among the victims, the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had left Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses is located between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently transferring to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean, mostly in much too small boats. Last year, 174 people were killed on this route, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR).
The Who Cancels Concert
A U.S. concert of rock band The Who has come to an end because of a lack of attention from lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the performance on Wednesday night (local time) in Houston, his voice failed to serve. At the eighth song, Daltrey told the audience, "I think I should let it go while it's still running".
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend apologized and added that Daltrey could "not really speak now". The audience promised Townsend to get at his expense at a reparation concert. However, an appointment is not yet set.
The Who, scheduled for Friday in Dallas and Sunday in Denver, said they would be picked up at a later date. 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Renting suddenly stopped: WeWork makes real estate markets tremble
In New York, WeWork has risen to become the largest office tenant.
Within a few years, WeWork rises from small startup to driving force in the most expensive real estate markets in the world. But now the company is in crisis. Tenants have to fear for billions of dollars in revenue.
The crisis of office landlord WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance in the world’s largest real estate markets. The company had resigned as head of tenant Adam Neumann a few days ago, postponed the planned IPO, and began selling subsidiaries and assets such as the private jet for executives to gain financial leeway for the coming weeks and months. In addition, the UK’s “Financial Times” reported WeWork’s new lease of ownership.
WeWork leases large office spaces in the long term and leases them to members in short term in some small units. These can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork has been burning money at breathtaking speed with this business. Last year, the company suffered a loss of $1.6 billion, with a turnover of $1.8 billion, the company is estimated to have increased immediately.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now concluded leases with terms of up to 15 years, resulting in commitments of more than $40 billion, which could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert of Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, was similar to WeWork in the past 24 months. Only WeWork’s new contracts made sure that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the areas newly brought to the market at that time. Without WeWork’s expansion, the company would have been able to expand its business.
Even in the UK capital, the balance in the real estate market could be felt without a further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, in an office building bought last year by Sparkassen fund provider Deka for almost 100 million euros in the center of the financial metropolis.
Many landlords have converted their properties for WeWork’s requirements with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the property owners would probably have to write off part of the expected billions of income. Access to WeWork’s reserves – already scarce anyway – is not available despite the long-term leases. Because the leasing of the individual locations of WeWork is usually done by the so-called subsidiary, which is based on a special vehicle.
Russia again arrested numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has once again taken action against North Korean fishermen, and a total of 262 more poachers have been arrested in recent days who have illegally fished in the waters, according to the Russian domestic intelligence agency FSB told Interfax on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen were arrested from North Korea. Previously, the border guards were shot and three of them were injured. This time, there were no casualties, it was said. Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore travelling in Russian territorial waters, where, according to their own data, the Russian Coast Guard is patrolling to protect their marine biological resources. In the re-checking, 30,000 squids were discovered. In addition, the data were seized after three fishing boats and two motorboats and, according to Nachodka and Posjet, the coast guard at Vladivostok, the agency of Ria Nowostok, has been arrested as a total of 8,000.
The Russian fishing authority had not issued any fishing licenses to North Koreans this year, according to media reports, thousands of North Korean fishermen have been detained there for some time in 2019.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the far-eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently also complained about high ecological damage caused by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with tightly meshed synthetic nets banned in Russia. These would also bring small living creatures out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would not be able to dismantle the technical regulations, even if they needed 200 years.
According to Moscow, three members of the Russian Coast Guard were injured in the arrests last week, and a North Korean, who was also wounded, later died of his injuries to the FSB. On September 17, Russian border guards first captured a North Korean boat and then a second one after it opened the fire.
U.S. Bans Ex-President Castro
The U.S. imposed a ban on the entry of former Cuban President Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Castro and his children. The U.S. State Department justified this in a message Thursday with Castro’s involvement in “gross human rights violations”. As head of the Caribbean Communist Party, he was in front of a system in which thousands of Cubans were arbitrarily arrested and there were more than 100 political prisoners.
As the leader of the armed forces, Fidel Castro’s brother, through the support of Venezuela’s president, Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s Maduro, is also complicit in human rights violations there. “The disregard of human rights and the use of force by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime, are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and in Venezuela.”
President Donald Trump on Wednesday issued a ban on entry against members of the Venezuelan government and the military. In Venezuela, a fierce power struggle between the government and the opposition has been raging for months. The US has imposed a series of sanctions against Maduro’s government to force him to his knees and force opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim president Juan Guaid<0xC3><0xB3> to power.
Cuba is considered to be one of Maduro’s closest allies. The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of dispatched doctors. According to the US and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government suppress government opponents.
New climate protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the biggest international climate protests so far, thousands of people want to take to the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement plans to re-launch actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world. New Zealand and Australia are expected to begin due to the time shift before the protests move across Europe to North America, where climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to attend a major rally in Montreal, Canada. Demonstrators also wanted to gather in front of the White House in Washington.
“Last Friday, more than four million people went for the climate. This Friday, we’ll do it again!” she wrote on Twitter. So far, there have been 6383 actions in 170 countries during the strike week, she added.
A good third of the world’s demonstrators – around 1.4 million – participated in the protests in 575 German cities, according to estimates by Fridays for Future. This time, according to a list of the movement, rallies are planned in at least 65 cities. Among them, in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller towns and cities such as Jüchen Nordrhein, and also in the cities of the West.
In August 2018, at the age of 15, Thunberg was sitting in front of the Swedish parliament to call on the politicians of his country to step up their efforts to protect the climate. This resulted in the Fridays-for-future movement in a short period of time. The climate protests were mainly attended by pupils and students, but increasingly also by scientists and other adults.
Together, they call for more ambition from politics in the fight against global warming and the impending climate disaster, and above all, under the Paris Climate Agreement, global warming must be reduced to below 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial times.
Thunberg had arrived in New York just a month after a two-week Transatlantic Tower with a high-sea race yacht, where she had recently participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday, she gave an emotional speech at the UN, in which she was strongly advised to the heads of state and government of the earth about climate protection.
Russia bans smoking on the balcony
People in Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balcony in the future. This provides for a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," a spokesman for the Ministry of Emergency said in Moscow on Thursday, according to the agency Tass. The ban is due to come into force on October 1.
Anyone who smokes, however, must therefore expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette should ignite a fire, then the penalty is higher. Under the ban, burning candles are also covered by the Ministry. Also, grilling meat chips on the balcony is no longer allowed.
Cybercriminal Strike - Investigators Lift Servers
In the fight against crimes on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time lifted a large server provider for illegal transactions in the Darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of having hosted numerous websites as operators of a data center in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Moselle, via which international criminals operate their machinations.
This was reported by the Prosecutor General's Office in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday evening in a large action. The Darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
Customers of the suspects are said to have been the operators of the world’s second largest darknet drug marketplace, “Wall Street Market”, which had investigators smashed in the spring. The attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was also controlled via a server in the cyber bunker, according to the Attorney General’s Office.
Such a hoster was first lifted in Germany, it said. A web hoster provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
During the access campaign with the support of special units such as the GSG9, there have been searches in Germany and neighbouring countries. It has been the result of almost five years of investigation. At noon, the investigators want to inform about further details.
New global climate protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the biggest international climate protests so far, thousands of people want to take to the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement once again planned actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to attend a major rally in Montreal, Canada.
Climate protests <0xC7><0x80> Who are Thunberg's backmen?
The sense of justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the climate. All the more amazing that a 16-year-old girl keeps the power people of this time in front of the mirror. But what is behind it? Is it helpfulness or clever marketing of a climate activist? Historical masterpiece or manipulative tactics for his own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and makes young people stand up for a better climate-friendly world. Historically, it is not the first time in Europe that a young person has managed to win a collection of children and young people for himself. Already in 1212 a child named Nikolaus from Cologne felt that he has chosen to win himself over the sea in order to win a more just world.
But is there a shadow side in this regard? Why does it need a stock called "We don't have time" to save the world thanks to the fact that there is a lot of money in the media? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers by her side. By the way, her mother has published a book that has sold itself widely, thanks to the daughter standing in the limelight. Also, some old-timed followers of Greta Thunberg were a bit over and last.
Here the ghosts are now separating: Is it morally right to enrich themselves financially in saving the world? Is it still authentic when certain people work together with stockbrokers during the World Rescue Action? No matter which position is ultimately taken, a critical and reflected point of view is increasingly important in a democratically shaped society, because democracy lives by different opinions and discussions. That is why it can make sense to make it out of different trends and discussions.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crosses through our solar system
A strange comet is currently crossing our solar system.
Astronomers’ assumptions have been confirmed: A strange comet is currently crossing our solar system – it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - For a long time, the researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: a comet from another star is currently crossing our solar system. It was named after its explorer 2I/Borisov and is currently employed by astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissov in Crimea. He looked at the sky with a self-built telescope and further observations confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that does not come from our solar system. It is only the second of its kind that was seen during the passage.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to gain insights into a foreign solar system from close proximity. Apparently, the comet is similar to that of our own system, as the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands reports. The comet is clearly interstellar in origin, according to the International Astronomical Union (IAC) and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbelly orbit that leads it out of our system.
Comet has already been sighted before approach - and can be observed for several months
But before it is so far, astronomers can observe it in depth, because unlike its predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in its approach, which means that it can be studied from Earth for many months. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and will then only be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia of the US-Rrocchia.
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First findings on Comet 2I/Borisov awaken hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 kilometers in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body seems to be similar to our comets - because as the IAC researcher Julia de Le<0xC3><0xB3>n puts it, the spectrum of the tail star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in ours, added de Le<0xC3><0xB3>n’s colleague Javier Licandro.
The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within just two years may allow a new way of exploring certain processes in other solar systems.
Recently, a giant asteroid rushed past the Earth and came dangerously close to it.
"Absolutely reprehensible": Rachel Johnson horrified by brother
To Boris Johnson, it becomes more lonely. First, his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister clearly scourges the Prime Minister’s belligerent language as “tasteless.” It is not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "fraud", contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and is constantly getting up - at least verbally. At the question hour in the House of Commons on Wednesday, this was met with massive outrage from the opposition, and in the meantime other critics have spoken out: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother was using words such as capitulation, as if the opponents of an EU exit should be "hanged, pulled, quartered, tarred and feathered". They consider this extremely reprehensible. They do not recognize the version of their brother, Rachel Johnsons, who was in the elections to the EU Parliament for the Anti-Bhang, said.
In particular, she came across the fact that her brother Jo Cox mentioned, an EU-friendly lower house MP, who was obviously a victim of a misdemeanor who had been murdered by a neo-Nazi a few days before the 2016 resignation referendum, whose memory can best be honored by going through Brexit, Boris Johnson had said in the lower house.
Cox’s widower also sharply criticized the prime minister. “It makes me sick when Jo’s name is used in this way,” he tweeted. The best way to honor them is to be passionate and determined about what you believe to be – no matter what view you are. But you never have to “demonize the other side.” He also lamented that an atmosphere was likely created in the attack.
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson's younger brother Jo had resigned as Secretary of State and his mandate as Tory MP. "I have been torn between loyalty to the family and national interest in recent months - it's an indissoluble tension," Jo Johnson explained.
Johnson’s language also faced sharp criticism in the Church. As the Times reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that is “not worthy of this country”. In a joint statement, they stated: “In recent days, language, both in debates and outside parliament, has not been acceptable. We should speak with respect.”
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at the Super Bowl
In the year of its 100th anniversary, the NFL is setting a strong signal: in the half-time show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women with Latino roots will appear, promising "an explosion of fun and energy".
Latina Power at the Super Bowl: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the half-time show at the upcoming U.S. football league NFL finals, which the organizers announced on Thursday (local time).
“I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latino community alongside JLo, because it has an incredible strength in the United States,” Shakira said in a video.
The final of the American football league, which celebrates its 100th birthday next year, will take place in Miami on February 2. In the metropolis at the southern tip of Florida, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is Puerto Rican origin.
“I love that the Super Bowl puts two women on the stage this time – and two Latinas,” Lopez explained. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises for the show “an explosion of fun and energy”.
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s she landed big hits with songs such as "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later also published songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and can be seen in German cinemas in the drama "Hustlers" from November.
Shakira became known in Colombia as the star of a telenovela and singer, her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Wherever".
The announcement of the mid-term guests is expected every time in the US. This year, many also regard the selection as a political gesture. After all, the country, not least because of President Donald Trump’s immigration policy, is deeply divided.
The Super Bowl is the biggest U.S. sporting event and at the same time a huge advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones caused a stir there. As a rule, over 100 million television viewers watch the NFL finale, it is now extremely popular in Germany as well.
Last year there was political controversy in advance. The reason was the dispute over quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to stand up to the National Anthem in protest against police violence against Blacks and had been badly tackled by US President Donald Trump, among other things. Due to solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had refused a super-bowl appearance, and among others, the band had rejected a super-bowl appearance.
An actor and YouTuber joins Egypt’s ruler: For the time being, Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men, who had no influence on whether blood was flowing back on the streets of Egypt, had left Egypt's plebiscite last week, and left Egypt's plebiscite to the state of Egypt. "The first freely elected head of state of the country, Mohammed Mursi, was the former general, who in 2013 favored the Muslim brother of the President of the United States.
In the opinion of the president of the other man, who currently determines the events on the streets, Mohamed Ali remained, of course, abroad, where he evaded the access of the security forces, who would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old was known as an actor only to a minority of the Egyptians, and today he is the tone of the Egyptian voice.
He approaches the head of state directly and in a very rustic language. While the people are hungry, the president swallows in luxury and lets himself build magnificent new palaces, it says. The army leadership, on which Sisi relies his rule, accuses Ali of corruption and enrichment. Because in his second job as a construction contractor he has been talking about exactly these gentlemen's business for 15 years - he seems to know quite exactly where to go.
After the first week since Sisi's grip after the power had ended thousands of protests against his rule, the protest group had protested for the first time, and the protest group had protested for the first time in the streets, and almost 2,000 people, among them prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, called Ali for a "million march" for this Friday. That really so many people would venture on the streets, was unlikely. But it came to be too small.
From the city of Mansura in the Nile Delta, where protesters last week wanted to prevent the raiding of a banner with the president's portrait of the unarmed, a bombardment of the president's remains was reported on Friday. Security forces built checkpoints in the city and on the outage roads. In Cairo, several subway stations in the city center were closed for "maintenance work", most streets around the Tahrir Square, the heart of 2011 were closed.
Mohamed Ali initiated these arrangements to change his tactics: "Our goal doesn't have to be Tahrir Square," Ali told his Barcelona video camera. "Let's not clash with police officers," but as a retractor, this was not to be understood: "All Egypt is Tahrir Square".
If the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection seems to be always much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various test options.
If you enter into an internet contract, you don’t have to blindly trust the speed data of the providers. Customers can check themselves for any abnormalities, how much of this is actually achieved.
Finally, the pre-promised transfer rates are an integral part of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, explains the Consumer Centre of Bavaria.
If the connection seems to be always much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various test options. Thus, the measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"However, the tests of the providers are carried out according to supplier-specific specifications and are therefore not calculated uniformly and objectively," says the Consumer Centre Bayern on its side.
If the connection is significantly slower than announced, customers can set the provider a reasonable time limit of usually 14 days to produce the promised service.
If this does not work even after multiple requests, customers can cancel and, in some cases, claim damages, but in the absence of success, only the appeal will help.
First high-ranking Republican to investigate
"I think the investigation is important, yes, and where that leads from here is determined by the facts that are being determined," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wanted to know more about the whistleblower affair - before measures can lead to impeachment.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selensky in a phone call to investigate interventions by Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine, because Trump observed Biden "for years".
Republicans have so far withheld criticism of Trump for the whistleblower affair; few have expressed discomfort about it. Scott’s statements are a first sign of this in Trump’s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has repeatedly turned against Trump’s policies, such as the loosening of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
Spider-Man Remains in MCU: Another Marvel Movie Planned
It was a shock to all Spider-Man fans: At the end of August, it was announced that Sony and Marvel will go separate ways in the future. Tom Holland’s Spider-Man would no longer be part of the “Avengers” universe. It was completely unclear what to do with the films about Tom Holland.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man receives another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home". This report is consistent with several U.S. media reports. The film is scheduled to start in the U.S. from July 16, 2021.
In the magazine "Screenrant", Marvel-Boos Kevin Feige is quoted as saying: "I am delighted that Spidey's path will be continued in the MCU. I and everyone at the Marvel studios are very pleased that we can continue to work on it ... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes, as Sony will continue to bring on his Spidey verse."
But how does the sudden good news come about? Sony Marvel reportedly offered an offer. According to industry magazines, the Disney group, which also includes Marvel, would participate with 30 percent in the revenue of upcoming Spider-Man movies. However, the news is not confirmed.
How Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry turn up in the "Suits" final
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" in the USA has now reached the grand finale. In the last episode, there were many happy endings and as many cameo appearances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who participated in the series for many years, were paid tribute in a charming way. Attention, the following sections included spoilers to the series finale.
One advance: Duchess Meghan did not return in the final for a final farewell greeting as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some retrospectives showed once again the most memorable scenes with the current Duchess. For example, the moments of the failed and the successful wedding with Mike or how she welcomed him after his suspended imprisonment.
But her real husband, Prince Harry, was also casually mentioned in the "Suits" finale, but of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) walks straight towards the altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Power, 47) makes a bold remark about his suit.
Aegean: Baby and four more children drown in boat crash
A baby and four other children drowned in a refugee boat in the Aegean. In total, seven people died in the accident, according to the Greek Coast Guard on Friday. The nationalities are still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men were rescued.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently transferring to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean. Last year, 174 people were killed on this route, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR). Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer has now announced that he wants to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the EU Commissioner responsible, he wanted to "inform in Turkey about the refugee situation," Seehofer said on Friday, and then in Athens he wanted to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in order to help cope.
On Friday, a spokeswoman for the European Commission confirmed Seehofer’s planned trip with EU Interior Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France’s Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
On Tuesday alone, 654 people transferred to the Greek islands, the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection said on Wednesday.
Is the Turkey deal still working?
The increase in figures has recently raised doubts about the functioning of the 2016 EU-Turkey agreement, which provides that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants who illegally cross Turkey to the Greek islands. In return, the EU wanted to welcome a Syrian refugee from Turkey for every deported Syrian.
However, the processing of asylum applications is only arduous because of staff shortages on the Greek side. According to the Ministry of Civil Protection, Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos are home to almost 29,400 people. The worst is the situation on Lesbos: 5200 Migrants are currently housed in a warehouse with capacity for 650 people.
There have never been so many since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey refugee pact in March 2016, state broadcasters reported.
Climate change: heat leads to more heart attacks
According to physicians, climate change will put the health system to the test in the future. The climate changes are "very safe" one of the biggest challenges for the health system over the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Society of Cardiology. Especially the cardiovascular system made high temperatures and large temperature jumps in a short period of time, leading to people suffering from heart attacks.
Green politician must answer for embarrassing photo-pane
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign - was the cup manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian Green Chief holds a reusable cup in his hand on a photo, but now it came out: the cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It's been quite a long time unnoticed - and finally noticed. The reusable coffee cup with metal straw, Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens, never held her hand. On the party's website, she was seen in a photo with this cup, talking to citizens. However, the photo was already published before and also distributed to the media - and there was a poster.
Green boss must be responsible for photo-pane
The National Post then accused May of manipulation and that the party is producing fake news to appear more credible on the topic of "environmental protection", and that in the middle of an election campaign for the House of Commons election, in which Trudeau is also increasingly difficult due to a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral on social media and sparked the discussion about fake news. A user shares a comparison of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their chairman to hide their disposable cup".
May showed herself shocked and insisted on her blog not knowing anything about this action. To underline this, she immediately posted the original: she, in conversation with citizens, had a cup in her hand. However, she correctly stated, was from bamboo. She always saw him. A spokeswoman of the party said that it was just about not to hide the logo of the party in the picture, and that it was about not to hide a photo, but to hide something from the party logo in the picture.
"I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she told the Guardian, asking her over-engaged team, "If they want to edit a picture again, couldn't they do something about my face so I look younger?"
The German Greens have also come to Shitstorms because of their use of disposable plastic or because of air travel - their pictures were not photoshopped. Thus, the head of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, ate ice cream with plastic spoon on holiday, as merkur.de* reported.
Influencer Wants Free Upgrade: Lifetime Flight Ban at Cathay
Jaqueline Ng was reportedly given an upgrade by Cathay Pacific via email, but when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontaneously getting an upgrade for the Business Class - many passengers dream of it. Sometimes they are lucky, and the staff at the check-in offer a change from the Economy Class for free.
However, this case shows how not to do it: a self-declared influencer has actively asked the Cathay Pacific airline for a free upgrade. On Instagram, Jaqueline Ng follows more than 65,000 users. On May 30, she flew back from Taiwan to New York and on June 7.
On the way out, Jaqueline refused to upgrade, even though she showed an email in which her Cathay Pacific allegedly anticipated an upgrade. The letter said the influencer wanted to receive it from a marketing employee of the airline, but the airline accused Jaqueline of falsifying the email.
On the return flight Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time the woman was supposed to have presented the same mail, but with a different reference number. The staff at JFK Airport were skeptical: they were following suit at the head office. And in fact, the employee, from whom the mail allegedly originated, was supposed to have denied the mail contact with Jaqueline, which also did not confirm the mail system.
The airline staff at the airport canceled Jaquelines’ ticket and imposed a lifetime flight ban on Cathay Pacific, and for $1,400 (around $1,280) they had to buy a new flight ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests, because Cathay had reimbursed her for the price of her original ticket, but Jaqueline also claimed back the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: For Cathay, the influencer has committed fraud, it remains blocked for future flights. The airline’s terms and conditions also state that it does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with it – and now turns on a lawyer.
Oil prices report on ceasefire in Yemen
Oil prices fell by more than a dollar on Friday afternoon. Last year, a barrel (159 liters) of the North Sea variety Brent cost $61.83 – around 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price for a barrel of the American variety West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to $55.77.
The Wall Street Journal reports that Saudi Arabia has agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities in mid-September had put down five percent of global oil production. The Iran-backed Huthi rebels in Yemen’s civil war country had complained about the attacks. Saudi Arabia blames Iran like the US government, and a ceasefire would defuse the political tension in the region.
Should an agreement actually come about, one could focus on growth and demand concerns, said Ole Hansen, head of the Raw Materials Strategy department at Saxo Bank of Bloomberg news agency.
Oil prices are continuing its downward movement over the past few days, a week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had cost up to almost $59, Brent nearly $65.
Recently, according to insiders, Bloomberg reported that the repair work on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia is progressing faster than expected after the attack in mid-September, according to which the production volume has once again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and is moving back towards the original quantity.
Recently, there have been several press releases citing insiders reporting on rapid progress made by the state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco in the repair work, but commodity experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning an IPO and wants to avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, some relaxation was evident in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after Iran's capture and the recently issued release on the way to leave the port. The crew is now preparing the departure, while the ship is still ahead of anchor, shipping company Erik H<0xC3><0xA5>nell told the Swedish radio on Friday morning.
However, the U.S. announced that it would relocate defense missiles and soldiers to the Iranian arch-enemy in Saudi Arabia, fearing an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the U.S. and Great Britain had temporarily pushed oil prices up significantly in recent weeks.
Accusations of Trump are intensifying
In the affair about possible abuse of power by U.S. President Donald Trump, cover-ups against the White House have become loud. Several leading government officials have been intensively trying to prevent access to the text of the conversation after a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyi at the end of July. This said an anonymous whistleblower.
North Korea considers third summit of Trump and Kim questionable
North Korea has raised doubts that there will soon be a third summit in the nuclear dispute by Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump. The sense and the prospects of such a meeting are questionable due to a lack of progress in implementing first summit agreements in Singapore, senior diplomat Kim Kye-gwan said on Friday, according to the agency KCNA.
The U.S. has not done anything to implement the summit’s resolutions so far last year, said the North Korean Foreign Ministry’s adviser, who also criticized tightened U.S. sanctions and the joint military maneuvers of the U.S. and South Korea, but hopes for Trump’s “wise” and “courageous” decision to come back to a rapprochement.
Trump had said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit meeting would bring with Kim before he agreed to do so. Negotiations on the disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and missile program have stalled since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim in February in Hanoi, but in June they both met in the demilitarized zone again, where they have been reconciling their lives to the demilitarized zone.
Prince Harry: Weapon manufacturers to help mine clearance
The British Prince Harry, dressed in a blue anti-split vest, symbolically set fire to and destroyed a mine in Angola. Near a camp of the British Halo Trusts at the place of Dirico, he created the ignition circuit. At a safe distance, the explosive body exploded. Looking at the goal of getting Angola to stand free of mines by 2025, he later demanded that the name be given to "I am a running TV show".
Pounds under pressure - interest rate reduction expected
British pound under pressure
In the face of an early rate reduction, the pound loses in value compared to the euro.
Frankfurt’s speculation that the Bank of England (BoE) will soon be able to reduce interest rates to the pound sterling, with the British currency dropping by up to 0.4 percent to 1.2269 dollars on Friday.
The sales were triggered by statements from the central banker Michael Saunders, who brought a drop in interest rates, even if a chaotic Brexit could be averted, as the uncertainty would affect the British economy for the foreseeable future. This statement is surprising, as Saunders was considered a proponent of a restrictive monetary policy, said analyst Ricardo Evangelista of the House of Commons.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burdens on the economy through the Brexit Hickhack, without directly signaling a rate reduction. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lead his country out of the EU if necessary even without a divorce agreement as of 31 October.
More: With his provocations, the British Prime Minister has taken a high risk, but it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Further Russian Manipulations Revealed
Material from the Moscow analysis laboratory is manipulated - this confirms David Howman, former director of the World Antidoping Agency (Wada) and current head of integrity of the World Athletics Association.
At the start of the World Athletics Championships, new details about the doping scandal in Russia are revealed - and they destroy the little credibility that Russian sport had regained at the beginning of the year and only in the beginning of the year. In January 2019, the Moscow doping lab finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Antidoping Agency (Wada).
In December 2014, systematic fraud in Russian sport was revealed. After an individual examination at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, the Wada had locked up the Russian host agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. The International Olympic Committee read about 270 athletes in the country at the 2018 Summer Games in Rio and compete in the neutral winter flag.
Positive findings are missing
The following September, Wada lifted the Rusada ban again, but called for access to the laboratory and the samples mentioned. The data should provide information on the extent of cover-up of doping cases during state doping. They should help to punish athletes subsequently. Three months later, they were finally delivered.
The chairman of the independent integrity commission (AIU) of the World Athletics Federation (IAAF) has now been mentioned, but many have been told that the doping data from the Moscow analysis laboratory has been manipulated. "Yes. We have received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the task force has received the correct data," said David Howman in an interview with the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" of Friday.
The World Cup not affected
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: the Athletics Association is the only organization to hold the ban of Russia. At the World Cup in Doha, 30 Russian athletes start under a neutral flag. They had to prove that they were training outside the Russian system and undergoing tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada Manipulations had already put in space and asked Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks. Russia is now threatening the renewed ban on Rusada and, in the worst case, the exclusion of the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
