Welsh members of the National Assembly are afraid not to be taken seriously
Several members of the National Assembly were recently horrified by a proposal to change their name from Assembly member or AM (Member of Assembly) to member of the Welsh Parliament or MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reaction came due to plans to change the name of the National Assembly of the Welsh Parliament.
Members of several political parties are concerned that they may be ridiculed.
A Labour member said his group is concerned by your "MWP rhymes on Twp and Pwp"
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, "twp" means foolish and "pwp" bummer.
A member of the Plaid party said the group "is not happy" and has proposed alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative member said his group has an "open mind" when it comes to the name change, but added that the MWP is not far from the word "muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced not unlike the English Yorkshire dialect's pronunciation of the letter u.
The National Assembly's delegation, now writing bills to introduce the name change, said: "The final decision as to what members of the National Assembly should be named will of course be up to the members themselves."
A 2017 Welsh official decision gave the National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the delegation published the results of a public hearing on the naming proposals that demonstrated great support for calling the Assembly the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of National Assembly members, the delegation prefers Welsh Member of Parliament or WMP, while the MWP election received the most support during the public hearing.
The National Assembly members have apparently made other proposals, but the fight to become some has given the leader of the delegation, Elin Jones, the main work. She will submit the bill in a couple of weeks.
The legislation of the reforms contains other changes to how the delegation should function as well, including rules on the disqualification of assembly members and the design of a committee system.
Assembly members will be able to vote on what to call them when debating the bill.
Macedonians voiced in referendum to change the name of the country
The voters are due to vote on Sunday if they are to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The referendum was decided to resolve a conflict that has been going on for many decades with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighbouring country in the north represents a claim on the territory and has had many objections to Macedonia's membership applications to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he is going to look away from the result.
Those who support the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price of becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
The clocks in Saint Martin are stilling while the churches in Harlem, New York, are struggling
"The old I've talked to said that in the old days there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Adams.
"Today there is none of the parts."
He said he understands why the bars disappear.
"People are socializing in other ways nowadays," he said.
"Bars are no longer storks in the neighborhood that people visit to normal."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from selling the properties will not last as long as the tenants believe, "and sooner or later they are back where they started."
He added that churches can be replaced by share apartments filled with the kind of people who don't care about helping the historic places in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people buying shareholdings in these buildings are white," he said. "and so comes the day when all the churches are closed, because it is not likely that these people moving into the shareholdings will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white parishes before Harlem became a black borough – Metropolitan Community in 1870, Saint Martin church a decade later.
The original White Methodist Congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black parish that had preached nearby moved into the building.
Saint Martin was taken over by a black parish led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who also led the boycott of the shops at 125th Street, a main Harlem merchant where owners were opposed to hiring or promoting blacks.
The building suffered major damage in a fire in 1939, but when Pastor Johnson's followers planned to rebuild it, they also ordered a new clock game.
Pastor David Johnson, the son of Johnson senior and successor in Saint Martin, was proud and called the bell game "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the bell game in July called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "a historical instrument that cannot be replaced."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also commented that it was the first clock game in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who left the church to play at the larger clock game in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said that Saint Martin did not find a replacement for him.
What has happened in Saint Martin in recent months has become a complicated account of architects and construction workers, some of them added by the leaders of the lay people of the church, and others of the Episcopal Diocese.
The sacristy, which is the parish and consists of the laymen's leaders, wrote to the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese "would ask the sacristy to pay," although the sacristy was not involved in the diocese's addition of architects and construction workers.
Some of the members of the parish have complained about the lack of openness from the diocese.
13-year-old injured by shark during lobster dive in California
Authorities report that a 13-year-old was attacked by a shark on Saturday while diving for lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack happened just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel commented to KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy calling for help. He paddled over to the boy with a group and pulled him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought only the boy was thrilled to have caught a lobster, before realizing that the boy cried "something bit me!
“Something bites me!”
"His whole collarbone was torn off," said Hammel that he observed when he reached the boy.
"I screamed that everyone had to get out of the water: There's a shark in the water!" added Hammel.
The boy was picked up by an air ambulance and taken to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, and his condition is critical.
It is unclear what kind of shark it was that regretted the boy.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said in a press conference that a shark was observed in the area a couple of weeks earlier, but that shark was not a dangerous black shark.
Giles added that the boy suffered serious injuries to the torso.
Authorities closed access to the water from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate and secure the area.
Giles commented that there are more than 135 different species of shark in the area, but most are not believed to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's store chain invests in beauty products
The British store chain Sainsbury's will compete with Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams' beauty products and offer department store services in the store.
As part of an investment in Britain's beauty market, which is worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to grow while fashion and interior sales go down, Sainsbury's should test out their beauty products in 11 stores next year, and several stores if it becomes a success.
The investment in beauty products comes at a time when the shelves that used to be full of TVs, microwave ovens, and interiors are now empty.
Sainbury's said they will double the number of beauty products to 3,000 products and offer the brands Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
They should give the labels L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees more space and have separate areas for each brand as in the Boots stores.
The store will also relaunch its own makeup series Boutique and make most of the products vegan, which will attract more young customers.
In addition, perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will test the sale of its perfumes in two of Sainsbury's stores. The first opened in Croydon, London, last week, and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online action and a shift towards buying small amounts of food every day from local small shops means that large retail chains need to find new ways to reach customers.
Mike Coupe, managing director of Sainsbury's, has commented that the stores will look more and more like department stores, while the store chains are trying to fight the low-cost stores Aldi and Lidl with more services and goods that are not food.
Sainsbury's has merged with the Argos interior chain in hundreds of stores and introduced several Habitat stores, since they bought both chains two years ago. Sainsbury's claims that this has increased the grocery store and thus defended the acquisition.
The store girl's previous attempt to renew the beauty and pharmacy departments was not a success.
Sainsbury's collaboration with Boots in the early 21st century, but this ended when the parties did not agree on how to divide the profits from the pharmacies in the stores.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold the pharmacy chain Celesio, which had 281 pharmacies and owned the pharmacy chain Lloyds, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
They added that Lloyds still has a role to play and will offer an extended luxury series of skin products, including the La Roche-Posay and Vichy brands, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, commented: "We have changed how the beauty shelves will look and be experienced to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also added colleagues with special expertise who will be able to offer beauty services.
Our brands are designed to suit all needs, while the attractive environment and practical locations mean that we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "racing" after Holly Willoghby withdraws from deal worth <0xC2><0xA3>11 million
The star from the Dragons Den television program, Peter Jones, is "racing" after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of an agreement with his lifestyle brand worth <0xC2><0xA3>11 million to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time to promote their interior and worship brand Truly.
The couple's collaboration has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The host from the This Morning program, 37, made the news known on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left the star from Dragons Den, Peter Jones, amid the development of their new collaboration on a lifestyle brand to focus on their own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was "racing" when the golden Holly confessed during a strained meeting on Tuesday at Jones's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that Holly's new contracts—worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million—mean she no longer has time to collaborate on the interior and accessories brand Truly.
The partnership has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was thought to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to make known that she is not going to work with Truly, while Jones ran away from Britain to settle down in one of her vacation homes.
One source said, "Truly was certainly at the top of Holly's priorities.
It would be her long-term plan for the future, and would last for many decades.
Her decision to withdraw has surprised everyone involved.
Nobody believed their own islands on Tuesday, Truly was so close to the launch.
There's a department store in Marlow filled with goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that the decision of the This Morning host, who is one of the richest stars in the UK, can cost the company millions due to fierce investment in products, from pillows to candles to clothing and interiors, and can cause delays with the launch.
And that can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, who is the mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby created the brand Truly along with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
Para vacations together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is to become the brand ambassador for M&S and is to replace Ant McPartlin who hosts ITV's I'm A Celebrity program.
A source near Jones said last night, "We're not commenting on his business."
Tough conversations "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would get from the media to make a comment some might experience as "unpresidential" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Said Trump with his tariff vote as "newsreader".
"I haven't given up anything."
He commented that Kim is interested in a new meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump called a major step towards the disarmament of the nuclear weapons program in North Korea.
But negotiations on the nuclear weapons program have stopped.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders of the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not received a "equivalent response" from the United States regarding North Korea's early disarmament.
Instead, he added, the United States continues with sanctions to push North Korea.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
“It’s going well between us and North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He added that his work to improve relations with Kim has brought positive results—the end of rocket testing, aid in the release of hostages, and the return of the leases to U.S. soldiers.
He defended his unusual procedure in terms of relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get in, we had around 200 people standing right there," Trump said pointing to the group standing in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia destroy island and kill hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign aid organizations were told that there was no need for them.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok residents had to flee, no one declared a national state of emergency, which is needed to receive international relief.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have been very clear that they don't want international help, so it's a little challenging," Sumbung said.
As Redd Children put together a team to travel to Palu, it is still not certain if employees with foreign passports are allowed to work in the field.
Sutopo, the spokesman for the Agency for National Crisis in Indonesia, said that authorities are considering the situation in Palu to see if international organizations are allowed to offer emergency aid.
Although Indonesia is prone to earthquakes often, it is not particularly prepared for the forces of nature.
In the Aceh area, they have built shelters for tsunamis, but they are not common in the rest of the country.
Despite warnings against tsunamis in Palu, there was no alarm, most likely leading to more victims.
Traveling between the Indonesian islands is usually quite challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship docked in Lombok to treat those injured in the earthquake is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on the improvement of infrastructure in Indonesia during the presidential election, and has spent a lot of money on new roads and railways.
But lack of funding has made it difficult for the administration of President Joko, and next year there will be elections again.
President Joko is also pressured in terms of sectarian tensions in Indonesia, while members of the Muslim majority have welcomed his conservative belief.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee when Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets and used machetes, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge saves Liverpool vs. Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal while the position was 1-0.
He pushed the ball to the left before kicking him up and towards the goal.
The attempt sailed high above the penalty field and faucets toward the right upper corner of the goal.
Finally, the ball fell over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and into goal.
"I was just trying to get into that position to take the ball, and I knew that players like Shaq are trying to get as far forward as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kante came and lost the ball once without thinking about it, and then I shot the ball."
Chelsea led 1-0 after the break after scoring in the 25th minute by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
Prior to the goal, Hazard gave the ball to Mateo Kovacic before spanning off near midfield into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly took the ball in midfield.
Then he shot it in a nice way and hired Hazard into the penalty field.
Hazard ran faster than Liverpool's defense and scored with his left foot just past goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of victims in the Indonesia tsunami increases to 832
The number of victims in the Indonesia earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, the country's emergency agency reported early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed in the earthquake, which occurred on Friday and had a strength of 7.5 followed by 6 meter high waves, the spokesman for the emergency agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, reported in a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is now covered with collapsed buildings.

I also encourage everyone, including taxi drivers, who can catch something on dashboard cameras, to contact us in case they have important information."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman who was found is from Birkenhead and that she was found in a home.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have come to the area to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues and the police have stated that they are in the process of informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has tried to enter his own apartment, but has been told by police that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He did not know what to say when he found out what had happened.
The residents have been told that they are not allowed to enter their apartments in many hours.
Someone overheard a police officer say to a man that the whole area is a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene crying.
She says again and again "it's so terrible".

A crowd of policemen stood within the police band and observed a block of apartments.
If anyone has information they can send DM to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously by calling +44 (0)800 555 111 with the reference "log 247 from September 30".
Parliament statue of Cromwell becomes the last victim of the "rewrite of history"
The removal of the statue would be karma for Cromwell and the Taliban-like destruction of several cultural and religious objects in England that his Puritan followers did during the 17th century civil war.
But the Cromwell Association described Crick's proposal for the removal of the statue as "noise" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues, that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Palace would become a target.
The iconoclasm during the English Civil War was the cork ordered or performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, in the century before.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent representation of Cromwell is evidence of public opinion in the 19th century, and is part of the historiography of a figure that many still think it is worth celebrating."
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was in the 19th century, and is still today, regarded as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, and in his case, of course, it was against the monarchy.
Whether this representation is correct or not, is still a topic of discussion in historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century has shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell was an individual that we know represented one side of that divide.
What he achieved as Lord Protector is also worth celebrating and remembering.”
Mordargris Attacks and Kills Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, surnamed Yuan, was found dead, with cut artery and covered with blood, near a pig binge on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to give pigs vaccines on a farm on 30 May, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had recently traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning he found his cousin dead, and discovered that the gate of one of the pigbings was open.
He said that in the bin there was a large male pig with blood around its mouth.
The autopsy showed that a 250-pound pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"The legs of my cousin were bloody and destroyed," the cousin, named Wu, told Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance cameras show Yuan coming to the market at 04:40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed him did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked inside to prevent him from attacking others, while police gathered evidence of the scene.
Yuan's family is now negotiating compensation with the market leader.
Although rare, such attacks from pigs have occurred before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in Massachusetts, causing the man serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 295-pound pig held a Welsh farmer trapped between it and a tractor, until his wife frightened the pig away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba reported to CBC News that pigs are not aggressive to normal, but that the taste of blood can trigger the animals.
"They just want to play.
They like to bite a little, they are curious... they won't hurt you.
You just have to have enough respect for them," he said.
Remains of Hurricane Rosa bring rain to the southwest of the United States
As predicted in the weather report, Hurricane Rosa weakens over the cool waters along the northern coast of Mexico.
Still, Rosa will carry sausage rain to northern Mexico and southwestern United States for the next few days.
Rosa had wind speeds up to 136 km/h and was a Category 1 hurricane until 05:00 in the eastern time zone of the United States on Sunday, and the hurricane center was 620 kilometres southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa will be moving north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low pressure over the Pacific Ocean is forming, moving east to the west coast of the United States. Rosa comes closer to the Baja California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, and will move tropical humidity north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Tropical humidity will react with low pressure and cause heavy rain in the southwest for the next few days.
Locally, between 3 and 10 centimeters of rain can create dangerous floods and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity will cause rains of between 5 and 7 centimeters per hour in some parts of the southwest United States, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimetres of rain is expected in parts of the southwestern United States; especially over much of Arizona.
Dangerous floods can occur due to scattered terrain and tropical rain.
It was warned against hikes in the desert on foot due to the danger of tropical rain.
The rain can turn canyons into flooding rivers and lightning and thunderstorms will bring strong winds and dust.
The coming low pressure will also bring rain to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Total rainfall of over 1 centimetres is possible, which can create small floods and slippery roads.
This will be the first rain town for the season in the region.
Spread tropical rain cities will start in Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before rain increases late on Monday and Tuesday.
The Four Corners region can expect a lot of rain on Tuesday and Wednesday.
October can witness intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States while the Arctic is getting colder, but tropical regions will still be quite hot.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic differences in temperatures, even between small areas.
Sunday was an example of dramatic temperature differences in central parts of the United States.
There is almost a 20 degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, late summer heat will try to build up and spread again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a warm start to October, with 25 degrees and up from the southern part of the large plains to parts of the northeast United States.
New York City can reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
The long-term forecast indicates that there are high chances of above average temperatures in the East United States through the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watch Brett Kavanaugh hearing
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the U.S. Supreme Court and the woman who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six different television channels.
At the same time, the political discussion surrounding the case continued, with interruptions in the regular television programs of various broadcasters to reveal the latest news on Friday: a unity reached by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake that the FBI will investigate the charges over the next week.
Ford told the Supreme Court Committee that she is 100 percent sure Kavanaugh was feeling her when he was drunk and trying to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said, during a sentimental hearing, that he is 100 percent sure that it did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people saw the hearing on Friday, according to Nielsen.
The company reached this number by finding the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
The numbers were not clear from other channels showing off, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has trouble counting viewers watching from the office.
To put this into perspective, there are a similar number of viewers watching an American football final or the Oscars.
Fox News' hosts have supported Kavanaugh, and the channel was also the one with the most viewers during the day with 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen said.
ABC was in second place 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
People are still interested after the hearing.
Flake was in focus during the drama on Friday.
After Flake, a moderate Republican, declared that he is on Kavanaugh's side, he was filmed by CNN and CBS while Protestants called for him on his way to a hearing with a judging committee on Friday.
He stood and looked to the ground for several minutes while the protesters yelled at him on CNN live.
"I stand here right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to our country?"
Some said to him, "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office has spoken out, and before entering the elevator he said he would have more to say during the committee hearing.
The broadcasting agencies showed the hearing on television when the judging committee would vote for or against the nomination of Kavanaugh to a full Senate and further voting.
But Flake said he could only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against Kavanaugh over the next week, which Democrats have also requested.
Flake was in part persuaded to speak with his friend, Democrat and Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators afterwards, Flake made a decision.
Flake's decision proved to have power, because it became clear that Republicans could not vote for Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the complaints against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May blames critics for "playing politics" in terms of Brexit
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, accuses critics of her plans to leave the EU to "play politics" with the future of the United Kingdom without regard to national interests, in an interview with The Sunday Times newspaper.
Theresa May is in Birmingham, England, to attend the Conservative Party's conference on September 29, 2018.
Alongside the interview with May on the front page of the Sunday Times, an interview with former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, where he goes to the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and says that the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's fees is "completely absurd."
Wayde Sims shooting in the United States: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for Sims shooting
Police have arrested a man suspected of the fatal shooting where Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from Louisiana State University (LSU), was killed.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed for intentional murder, police say in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
An official video shows the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost their glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses on the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to a report from the WAFB channel, which is linked to CBS.
After hearing off with Simpson, police said he admitted to shooting Wayde.
Simpson's bail was set at $350,000, local newspaper The Advocate reports.
The Coroner of the East Baton Rouge publicized an early autopsy report on Friday showing that the cause of death was a shot in the head that went into the neck.
The Baton Rouge police thank the Louisiana state police special officers, the state police's crime lab, the Southern University police, and local residents for helping them find Simpson.
The athletic director of LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the local police for being "awakened in the achievement of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 meter tall basketball player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points with 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "trustless" after Wayde was killed.
"This is something we're always afraid of," Wade said.
Volcano spews ash over Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached southern parts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Crisis Prevention asks Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Sunday after activity increased in the crater and the center recorded 183 gas and ash emissions within 24 hours.
The center had observed several rumbles and tremors.
Social media images show thin layers of ash on cars in different neighborhoods of Mexico City, including Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since an earthquake of 7.1 struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is known as "Don Goyo" and has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists within the anniversary of the self-imposed vote
Six protesters were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters for self-defense clashed with police officers, and thousands of other protesters protested self-defense one year after the vote on any release from Spain.
A group of masked separatists were held back by police forces while throwing eggs and powder paints that created dark clouds of dust in streets that are usually filled with tourists.
The compound also erupted later in the day, and police used batons to prevent escalation.
For several hours, the separatists shouted "Don't forget, don't forgive" while the Protestants cried out to independence, "Long live Spain."
Local news channels reported that fourteen people were treated for minor injuries following the protests.
The mood is still pressed in the region and many will still have independence one year after the October 1st rally, which was called illegal by Madrid, but which was celebrated by separatists in Catalonia.
Most voters voted for independence, but there was also low voter turnout among those opposed to independence and boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent the violence and selective clashes occurred in the region.
Groups who were too self-sufficient slept in tents on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the state police.
However, the demonstration went off the stack, but it was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protests with his wife, said he no longer has the hope of independence in Catalonia.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy in order to be able to voice for independence, but now we're stuck again," he said.
Although they won the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties that are too self-sufficient to retain power this year, while many of their leaders are in exile or arrest while waiting for the trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of self-determination.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protests in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict was honed by police officers on both sides.
"The tension is increasing more and more," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been part of ongoing trials since last year, declared that he will run for office in the European Parliament next year.
"Standing as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and the oppression we have experienced from the Spanish state," he said.

Menga shot gives Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers in Scottish football
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secures says
Enthusiastic Livingston surprises Rangers and Steven Gerrard experiencing his second victory after 18 games as a coach for the Ibrox club in Glasgow.
Dolly Menga's shot turned out to make the difference while Gary Holt's side levelled with Hibernian in others.
Gerrard's side have no away wins in the Scottish Premiership league this season, and will play against Hearts, which they are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers are scheduled to host Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston has six consecutive wins, and head coach Holt has still not lost since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against away team
Holt's team was supposed to have rented long before they scored, creating several problems for Rangers with their direct play.
Scott Robinson broke through, but had low efforts toward goals, which required Alan Lithgow to work hard after meeting Craig Halkett's heading over the goal.
The home team was happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could create trouble for the away team.
And that's how the decisive goal became scora.
The Rangers agreed to a free kick and Livingston made an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson went against Menga, who took a touch and scored from the middle of the penalty field.
By then, the Rangers dominated the ball, but saw that the home defense was solid and keeper Liam Kelly was focused.
This pattern continues into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to save a goal.
Scott Pittman tried to score, but was stopped by Rangers' keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow flicked far after the ball was returned from Livingston.
Passes were sent back and forth in the Livingston penalty field, while two penalties – following Halkett's challenge to Glenn Middleton, and one by hand – were waived.
'Fenemental' from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal fight and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
Each player played fantastically and still impresses on the curve upwards.
Their playing and player style has hardly changed since they returned to the top class, but much of the thanks for it goes to Holt for the way he has shocked the team since he became a coach.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was intense, organizing a military-level defense, while Menga distracted Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the game.
In contrast, the Rangers were not motivated.
However, as good as they have been under Gerrard, they were not good enough this time.
They didn't play well enough, and only cut up the home half once, which should make the Rangers realize they don't reach up anymore.
Erdogan gets mixed welcome in Cologne
The leaders of Turkey and Germany smiled under blue skies when they met to eat breakfast on Saturday, September 29 in Berlin.
It is the last day of Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which is hoped to repair relations between the two NATO countries.
The countries have disagreed on human rights, press freedom and Turkey's role in the EU.
Erdogan went to Cologne to open a large, new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police prevented a crowd of over 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque due to "security reasons," but many of Erdogan's supporters turned up to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan - many of the Kurdish - also appeared to condemn Erdogan's policies and the German state's decision to wish him welcome in the country.
The dueling Protestants reflected the distinction between German Turks, who see Erdogan as a hero, and others, who see him as an autocrat.
Car accident in Deptford, London: Cyclist killed after collision with car
A cyclist has lost his life in a collision with a car London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, south-east London, at 10:15 local time.
The driver stopped and ambulance personnel arrived quickly, but the man died at the scene.
The collision happened only a few months after another cyclist died when the driver ran off on Childers Street, about 1 mile (1.6 km) from today's accident.
The London police reported that they are in the process of identifying the man and informing his family.
Roads have been closed and buses have to run around the area, while other motorists have been urged to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison in England: Six Guards Injured in Rebellion
Six prison guards have been injured in a riot in a men's high-security prison, says the prison office in England.
Ongoing disorder erupted in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. local time on Sunday.
Special "Tornado" forces have been captured to calm down the insurgency, involving eight prisoners in a secluded part of the prison.
The guards have been treated for minor injuries to the face.
A prison spokesman said: "Specially-trained guards are to calm down the ongoing insurgency in HMP Long Lartin.
Six guards have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those responsible will be reported to the police and may have to be in prison anymore."
It seats more than 500 people in HMP Long Lartin, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the UK.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was being treated for injuries, after a prisoner took action.
And in October last year, special officers had to come to the prison to calm down a serious riot, where prisoners threw billiard bullets at the guards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with embarrassment (in favor of drought area)
Tropical lows are rare in Arizona, but it is precisely such a weather phenomenon that is heading for Arizona early next week, in which the remnants of Hurricane Rosa trek southwest across the desert and create fear of embarrassment.
The National Weather Service has issued warnings against embarrassment on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move directly across Phoenix on Tuesday, and can give rain already late Monday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that only "ten tropical cyclones have had tropical storm or low pressure status within 300 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that reached 60 miles within the Arizona border."
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center report between 5 and 10 centimetres of rain, with isolated amounts up to 15 centimetres in the Mogollon Rim area of Arizona.
It can count between 2 and 5 centimeters in other areas of the southwest desert, including central parts of the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, with isolated total amounts up to 10 centimeters.
For areas outside of flood risk, the rain from Rosa may be a blessing in the drought.
Although embarrassment is a serious concern, this is likely to benefit areas of the Southwest United States that are prone to drought.
According to drought monitors in the United States, there is extreme drought in over 40 percent of Arizona, which is the second highest drought category, weather.com reports.
First, Hurricane Rosa will move across the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
With winds of over 135 kilometres per hour, Rosa is on Sunday morning 619 kilometres south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 kilometres per hour.
The storm encounters colder waters in the Pacific Ocean and therefore calms down.
It is expected to reach the coast of Mexico with tropical storm force, Monday afternoon or evening.
It is going to rain a lot in parts of Mexico, which can increase the risk of embarrassment.
"Rain between 7 and 15 centimetres is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with the possibility of up to 25 centimetres," weather.com reported.
Rosa will pull north along Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will pull further up through Arizona and into southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The greatest danger with Rosa or its remains, is much rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the U.S. Southwest Desert," said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to create life-threatening floods in desert areas and landslides in mountainous areas.
Attacks in Midsomer Norton, England: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested, suspected of murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset, England.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at around 4 a.m. on Saturday.
He was transported to hospital, and his condition is stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested tonight in the Radstock area, reports Avon and Somerset police.
Police have urged people who may have mobile footage of what happened, to contact.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered" during how "bad and angry" Democrats were at him
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the merciless and unreasonable tactics of the Democrats," Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has "suffered" under how "bad and angry" the Democrats were through the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, and emotionally denied the charge by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified about her charges during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the "American people got to see how brilliant and courageous" Kavanaugh was that day.
"A voice to Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to one of the most skilled lawyers of our time, a lawyer with flawless service in public," he said to a crowd of followers in West Virginia.
The president also referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of voting for Republicans in the U.S. midterm elections.
"Five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm really running," he said.
"That's why I travel around to fight for good candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats are looking to "stand up and block."
The first important vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place late Friday, a Republican representative said to CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, the number of killed increases
At least 384 people have been killed, many of them taken by huge waves on beaches, while a severe earthquake and a tsunami rammed the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities reported on Sunday.
Hundreds of people were gathered to take part in a festival on the beach in the town of Palu on Friday when the waves, which were six meters high, hit the beach at sunset, taking many people while destroying everything they came across.
The tsunami came after an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
"When the warning of the tsunami came yesterday, there were still people on the beach who did not leave immediately and so they became victims," stated Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the crisis relief agency in Indonesia BNPB, in Jakarta.
"As if the tsunami wasn't enough in itself, he was carrying cars, tree trunks, houses; he rammed everything ashore," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled across open seas at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some climbed into trees to avoid the tsunami and survived that way.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Photo from the air published by the emergency agency shows many destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continue to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake could be felt in the surrounding area, which has a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia's Bureau of Testing and Testing Technology (BPPT) stated that the energy from the earthquake on Friday, was about 200 times stronger than the energy from the atomic bomb over Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long, narrow wave, may have increased the size of the tsunami, the agency said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls, and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of the dead have been found during the remains of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and that 29 are still missing.
Nugroho said that the number of casualties and the size of the destructions may be larger along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
"We haven't heard anything from Donggala, communication is cut" Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live there," stated the Red Cross, adding that their employees and volunteers are on their way to the hit areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," said the Red Cross.
The crisis agency was criticized on Saturday for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, although authorities said waves came within the period notified.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building crying desperately to people down the streets to warn them of the coming wave.
A few minutes later, a wall of water hits the coast, bringing with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the video with the first.
The quake and tsunami caused power outages and cut communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate emergency aid.
The military has started the process of submitting cargo planes with emergency assistance from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities report, but the refugees still need food and have other basic needs.
The city's airport was reopened to accept emergency aid, but will continue to be closed until October.
It was planned that President Joko Widodo would visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in Indonesia exceeded 800.
It's very bad.
The employees of World Vision from Donggala have arrived safely in Palu city, and have set up tents in the back yard of their office. On their way to the city they passed completely destroyed areas, Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of broken houses," he said.
It's very bad.
As the relief organizations begin work to help those affected by the tsunami, some have complained that foreign relief workers with expertise in crisis management have been denied entry to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, foreign aid organizations and their staff cannot start work until Indonesia has declared the area to be a national crisis zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's a provincial-level crisis," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"When the state says, 'OK, this is a national crisis,' we can open for international emergency aid, but they haven't updated their status yet."
There is evening left in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, and friends and family of those still slowed still hope for a miracle, but know that such natural disasters do not end well.
On Saturday, a small boy was rescued from the sewer.
On Sunday, a woman was rescued from the remains of a collapsed building, where she had a doctor trapped next to her mother's death for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the slow paragliders from the Asian games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
A man called Mandagi said that any of those trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
"As one with a lot of experience in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to bear," he said.
Gendon told us that he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Paragliders from Palu, who had taken part in the local beach festival, after he heard that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed.
But his messages showed only a gray chin, instead of two blue chins.
"I think that means the messages didn't come out," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 from Newport ATM, Levee, United States
On Friday, thieves stole $26,750 from a worker at Brink's company in what he was filling up an ATM in Newport, Levee, United States, according to a Newport police press release.
The worker had just emptied an ATM in the entertainment area and was delivering more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy stated in the press release.
As the worker was busy, a man jumped up behind the worker and stole a sack of money to be delivered.
Witnesses observed several suspects while fleeing the scene, according to the press release, but police could not determine the number of people involved in the robbery.
If anyone has information about who was involved, they should call the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The Rapper Renames to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name - to Ye.
He declared the name change on Twitter on Saturday, writing: "The creation formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has had Ye as his nickname for a while, and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which he released in June.
The name change came just before he was scheduled to perform on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show after she canceled due to "emotional reasons," said the host.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current stage name, West has previously stated that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think the word "ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," West said earlier this year when discussing the album title with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
The name has changed from Kanye, meaning the only one, to only Ye - to reflect the good we do, the bad we do, our confusion, everything.
The album reflects on who we are."
Kanye is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he declared that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has collaborated with West previously, has also changed the writing style to the name with and without hyphens and capital letters.
Future President of Mexico promises not to send the military against civilians
The future president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised never to send military forces against civilians. The country will soon mark the 50th anniversary of the bloody treatment of students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he "will never use the military to oppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the military shot at peaceful protesters and killed about 300 people, at a time when left-wing student movements spread in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly support to students and opening several free universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of access to education have led young people to join criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double investment in artificial intelligence
Since China is working more actively with artificial intelligence, the United States should double its investments in research on the subject, says the investor and user of artificial intelligence, Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
His comments came after various parts of the U.S. government stated on artificial intelligence, although the U.S. lacks a formal strategy for the use of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year, aiming to be number 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"A doubling of the budget for research on artificial intelligence would be a good start, as all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
A doubling in funding could double the chances of the next major breakthrough in artificial intelligence occurring in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, who published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month via the publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the managing director (CEO) of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the largest companies of artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with a system of artificial intelligence that beat the highest ranked player of the game Othello, and later worked as a leader in Microsoft Research and was chairman of Google in China.
Lee recognized previous technology competitions organized by the U.S. state, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked what time the next competition should be, so that he joins and identifies the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States usually have to work hard to get support from the state, Lee said.
"It's not China taking the academic leaders, it's the big companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired distinguished students from universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States strengthen research on artificial intelligence.
"I think PhD students in artificial intelligence should get automatic residence permits," he said.
China’s State Council published its plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Federation of Natural Sciences funds students at academic institutions, not unlike the U.S. National Science Association and other state organizations' way of distributing money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint center of artificial intelligence, which is intended to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House declared the formation of a committee of artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI (artificial intelligence) Next.
The National Science Association invests more than $100 million a year in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, no one has worked on the national security and artificial intelligence bills for several months.
Macedonians are shouting in referendum to change the name of the country
The Macedonian people voiced on Sunday in a referendum if they should change their name to the Republic of North Macedonia to resolve a decades-old conflict with Greece, which has tried to prevent Macedonia from becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, insists that the name of the neighboring country in the north represents a claim on their territory, and has used vetoes to vote against membership for Macedonia in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new proposed name, but nationalist opponents argue that the name change may undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott has sown doubts as to how far the referendum is going to reach the at least 50 percent of the population it needs to be valid.
The question on the referendum seat is: "Are you for NATO and EU membership and agree on the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price of the name change is worth membership of the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that achieved independence after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I am here today to voice for the future of this country, for the youth of Macedonia, so they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not binding according to the law, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have said that they will follow the result of the vote to make her decide.
In order for the name change to take place, Parliament needs two-thirds resolution.
The State Electoral Committee reported that nothing unusual had happened by 13:00.
Only 16 percent had voted, as opposed to 34 percent in previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 of all registered voters voted.
"I voice for my children, we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voiced in Strumika in the referendum in Macedonia in order to change their name and open to join NATO and the EU on September 30, 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a boycott of the referendum in front of the Parliament of Skopje, by setting up tents and chairs.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we are not to change the name of our country," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us under the name Macedonia, we can go to others, like China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev has stated that NATO membership will attract investors to Macedonia, which has over 20 percent unemployment.
"I believe that the majority will vote for the change, of which 80 percent of our citizens will become members of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said that a "yes" result can be interpreted as a "statement of our future."
A poll last Monday by Macedonia’s Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will take part in the referendum – which is below the required figure.
Another poll by the Telma TV channel in Macedonia, showed that 57 percent of voters plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, the channel said that 70 percent would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to close, at least 50 percent must vote, plus one vote.
If the referendum does not close, it may damage the policy of the left-wing government that took over in May.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero navigates through Brighton defense and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling rejected the Brighton defence leading to 2–0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy, scoring for the 65th minute.
The Argentine tip accepted a pass on the midfield at the start of the sequence.
He crashed past three Brighton defenders and reached open ground.
Suddenly, Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He made his way around one defender, before running past several others on the edge of the Brighton penalty field.
He passed a pass on the left and found Sterling.
The English tip used its first kick in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton keeper Mathew Ryan with a shot straight into the right end of the goal.
"Aguero is still struggling with his feet," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him being able to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored when he did."
But it was Sterling who gave them sky blue the first advantage of the Premier League game.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero accepted the ball deep inside the Brighton Territory.
He kicked the ball beautifully along the left end of Leroy Sane's path.
Sane held on to the ball while hiring Sterling towards the goal.
The sky blue tip kicked the ball into goal right before slipping out of the field.
City will play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 on Tuesday in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play spoiler against Rockies in American baseball
With the Nationals eliminated from "playoff contention" there was not much reason to force a new start.
Scherzer has a high competitive instinct, and hopes to take the "mound" on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if it can lead to the "playoff" for the Rockies, who lead with one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies won at least 5–2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but look forward to locking down the tied first division title.
"Although we're not playing for anything, it's worth playing because of the atmosphere here in Denver, with the audience and the other team most likely playing at the highest level so far this year.
Who wouldn't want to play with such relationships, would they?"
It is still unclear who will start in the Nationals on Sunday, but Scherzer may be going "pitche".
Scherzer, who then starts for the 34th time, threw a "bullpen session" on Thursday and is going to "pitche" normally on Sunday.
Scherzer, coming from Washington, is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 "strikeouts" in 220 2/3 "innings" this season.
Trump gathers voters in West Virginia
The president referred in an obscure manner to his first choice for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about how important it was for the Republicans to vote in the U.S. midterms.
"Everything we've done so far is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not running, but I'm running around everywhere to fight for the best candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this terrible, terrible group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are informed that they are certainly going to take back power, you see how terrible they are, how disgusting they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to take power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "oppose and block."
"And you can see it based on the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "sinty and bad and nasty and dishonest."
He referred to Senator and Democrat Dianne Feinstein, who had his audience bow.
"Do you remember her answer?
Was it you who leaked documents?
Eh, eh, what?
No, eh no, I'm waiting - it was really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer tolerant.
They are intolerant to those who say what they mean
When the Momentum activists in my local party voiced to censor me, it was not surprising.
I'm the last in a number of Labour MPs to have been told I'm not welcome - just to say what I mean.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way because she protested anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
When it came to the importance of running responsible economy, national security, Europe, and other similar issues that Jeremy ironically disagreed with previous leaders about.
In the call for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday, it stated "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
In my last eight years as a Labour MP, Friday meetings have been just like that.
Unfortunately, today's meeting was not like that, and the promise of "smarter" policies is long forgotten, if at all it was followed.
It has become more and more apparent that different views are not tolerated in Labour, and that each opinion is judged by the leaders of the party.
This happened shortly after Jeremy became party leader, when colleagues I used to be politically agreed with suddenly expected that I would change my mind and agree on issues I would never agree on - whether it was national security or the internal market in the EU.
When I speak in public it has nothing to say what I say, I always get quiet on social media and people want me to resign while they criticize center politics and say I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments against me are at least political.
I admire my colleagues who get gender-discriminatory and racist harassment directed at them every day and who are still professional and not resigning.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this time period, is how normalized it has become to harass police officers.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should become more tolerant.
In reality, we are no longer a tolerant party that has something for everyone. For every proposal of distrust and for every change in party rules, the party becomes narrower and narrower.
I have received a lot of advice over the past two years from people who have said I need to take it easy and not be so loud, so maybe people will "like me better."
But that's not why I chose to join politics.
When I joined Labour, when I was still in school 32 years ago, it was because I was angry with Thatcher and how the government failed the country. My classroom was falling apart, so I wanted better public services for those who needed them most - whether it was as a councilor or government minister.
I have never hidden my political opinions, nor in previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East may have been in doubt as to what I stand for and which of the current leaders I disagree with.
To those who voted for the proposal on Friday, I can only say that when the country rushes towards a Brexit that will hurt private, local businesses and public services, I don't understand why people care about wasting energy on questioning my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But in fact, so is not the only message I have directed to Nottingham Momentum, but to voters in the constituency, whether they are Labour voters or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no one can make me resign or change my policy and prevent me from serving you the way I think is best for you all.
Chris Leslie is Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr goes to the top in Scottish rugby
Two late "tries" might change the result a bit, but there is no doubt that Ayr was earning in this very entertaining Tennent's Premiership game today.
They now stand on top of the podium as the only invincible team of a total of ten.
It was their supreme defense and ability to take chances that gave the home team and their coach, Peter Murchie, good reason to be content.
"We've been put to the test in the last few games, and we're still invincible, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Ayr earns praise, they were better than us to take chances."
Grant Anderson had a "try" for the 14th minute, where Frazier Climo tried a "conversion," which put Ayr in front, but a yellow card from Scotland captain Rory Hughes of the Warriors allowed Melrose to gather, and Jason Baggot took an "unconverted try."
Climo received a penalty just before the break, he scora and "converted" a "solo try" to give Ayr 17-5 before the break.
However, Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's "try," which became "converted" by Baggot, reduced the spin-off by five points.
There was a long pause when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and laid on a stretcher, and from the restart, Ayr faucets forward through a "try" from Stafford McDowall, such as Climo "converted."
The acting captain of Ayr, Blair MacPherson, received a yellow card, and again Melrose attempted an "unconverted Bruce Colvine try," at the end of a series of aggressive games.
The home team played back, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball from the penalty line, MacPherson scored a "try."
Climo "converted" again after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's "box kick" and sent the "flanker" Gregor Henry away from the home team's fifth "try."
The star of the Scottish series, Still Game, starts a new career in the restaurant business
The Scottish Still Game star, Ford Kieran, seems ready for a new career in the restaurant business, after it was discovered that he is the director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays in conjunction with his partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last, and it seems Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official lists, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor will not comment on the case, but a source from the Scottish Sun newspaper has hinted that Kiernan would involve himself in the "successful restaurant business" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia hopes court will open waterway to the Pacific
Sailors patrol naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings flags with sea blue flags.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are covered with the motto: "The sea is ours. We are right
and the duty to return to it."
In landlocked Bolivia, the people can still remember a coastline the country lost to Chile, in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century. They long to sail in the Pacific again.
These hopes may be stronger than in many decades while Bolivia awaits the judgment of the International Court of Justice to come on October 1, after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has drifted, peace of mind and is committed, and of course expects a positive result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians are going to look at the ruling from the International Court of Justice, hoping that the Court of The Hague supports Bolivia's claim, and that Chile - after decades of negotiations - gives Bolivia an independent exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia – who is struggling to be elected again next year – has good reason to hope for a positive result.
"Now we will soon be returning to the Pacific," he promised in late August.
However, some analysts do not believe the court is going to allow Bolivia access to the sea - and that little would have changed even if they were granted access.
The Netherlands-based UN Court of Justice has no power to transfer Chilean territory to Bolivia, and has stipulated that they will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
That the court's ruling comes just six months after the last negotiations, indicates that the case was "not complicated," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert in international law.
For the past four years, far from promoting Bolivia's cause, they have done the opposite.
"The problem of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian administration," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales, with his belligerent rhetoric, has killed what was left of Chile's goodwill, Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate thought.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue the negotiations, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the issue after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, who is Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open new relationships with Chile" and a chance to "set a line at 139 years of disunity and rather benefit both," he said.
Calzadilla also rejected that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used this maritime issue to win rallies.
"Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is a possibility to see what we need to do to forget the past."
North Korea says they won't abolish nuclear weapons if they can't trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his nation cannot be the first to abolish, if they cannot rely on Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to follow up on the lift they gave during the meeting in Singapore between the U.S. and North Korean leaders.
Ri's comments come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pomepo, seems to want to restart his locked-in nuclear weapons diplomacy, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the United States has a false hope that North Korea will submit if the United States continues with sanctions and opposes any declaration of the end of the Korean War.
Washington refuses to agree to any declaration of the end of the war, without Pyongyang abolishing it first.
Both Kim and the U.S. President, Donald Trump, will hold a new meeting.
However, many are critical that Pyongyang is serious in terms of decommissioning and that the country most likely sees its weapons as a guarantee of security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump meeting.
Paris shows that massive headgear is the last fashion on its way to a shopping street near you
If you want to upgrade your hat collection or block the sun completely, then you don't need to search anymore.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a number of large and special headwear in their SS19 collection. The headwear amazed the public during the fashion week in Paris.
Highest impractical hats can be seen on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their shocking creations right on the catwalk.
The most magnificent garment was a sumptuous, beige Valentino hat with a feather-like, wide brim that covered the models' heads.
There was also other oversized worship during the fashion show, including a jewel-adorned watermelon, a wizard's hat, and even a pineapple - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a collection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lips sewn together and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than haute couture.
One of the creations resembled diving equipment, complete with snorkel and mask, while another looked like a melted ice in biscuits.
If you like this enormously dramatic fashion, you can just enjoy it.
Fashion experts predict that the huge hats come for sale in a shopping street near you.
The oversized hats come right after "La Bomba", the straw hat with the 60 centimetre wide brem which has been seen on celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult trademark behind the highly impractical hat, which was everywhere on social media, has now sent a new creation onto the catwalk – a straw beach bag of the same size as the bikini-clad model that carried her.
The beach bag, with the color of burnt orange and fringes topped with a white leather handle, was the most eye-catching part of Jacquesmus' La Riviera SS19 collection during the Paris fashion week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage commented to FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the fashion stores next summer - the designer has made such a big impression that I doubt it's possible to ignore the demand for oversized worship."
John Edward: Global citizens need language skills
Private schools in Scotland are known to be at a high academic level, and this continues in 2018 with excellent exam results, which are only enhanced by individual and joint success in sports, art, music, and other community measures.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), work to offer the best services to the students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for advanced and higher education, career paths, and the role of global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages are popular electives in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, the message goes to his heart."
This is an important reminder that we can not only lean in English when we want to build relationships and trust in people from other countries.
By looking at the exam results from this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest standing grades for independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who took foreign language received A.
The data, collected from SCIS' 74 member schools, shows that 72 percent of students received A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who took German, 69 percent of those who took French, and 63 percent of those who took Spanish also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital features, which children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Languages such as electives are considered equivalent to STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering studies, and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the British Committee for Employment and Property in 2014 showed that 17 percent of employers struggled to fill positions due to lack of language skills among applicants.
Therefore, language in school is more and more important to prepare youth for working life.
With more job opportunities for linguists, these properties are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what kind of career a youth chooses, if they have learned a second language, they have a decent advantage in the future with such a property.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person advantages in a competitive world.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adult Britons in 2013, 75 percent could not speak any language other than English well enough to keep a conversation going, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15 percent.
This is why it is so important to invest in language learning for our children.
Knowing multiple languages, especially the languages used in developing countries, can give children a better chance of finding good jobs in the future.
In Scotland, each school is different in terms of the language in which they teach.
Many schools focus on the classical modern languages, while others teach languages classified as important in the UK when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
No matter what your child is interested in, there will always be a multitude of languages to choose from in independent schools, and teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated and want to create a learning environment that will prepare children and provide the properties they need to close, no matter what the future brings.
One cannot reject that in this global, business-oriented environment, languages are vital to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in the education sector.
Modern languages should be called "international communication properties."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, thus offering diversity and high expertise to Scotland's young people.
I'll faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools
LeBron debuts in Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait time is soon over for fans who are eager to see LeBron James debut on the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the preseason game on Sunday, against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how long he's going to play hasn't been decided yet.
"It's going to be more than a minute and less than 49," Walton announced on the Lakers official website.
Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, tweeted that James will most likely play a limited time.
After training this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' preseason schedule.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to get ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube
President Donald Trump begins a whirlwind of campaigns tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump's five scheduled stops the coming week, including stops in friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote on hold to elect to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump has aimed to build support for upcoming mid-term elections since Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when votes are to be given in November.
How long will Trump be in West Virginia tonight, and how can you see it online?
Trump's gathering in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00 tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see Trump's West Virginia collection online below, via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will likely address this week's hearings by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who became excited about charges of sexual abuse, with an expected affirmative vote from the Senate on hold for up to a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the primary goal of this cave of collections is to help Republicans meet the November elections and gain some momentum (drive).
So President Trump's campaign says these five gatherings next week are aimed at "invoking volunteers and supporters that Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so critical of his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the busy campaign season," a spokesman for the Trump campaign who refused to be informed to Reuters.
Planned for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the gathering for the evening may bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw coverage from Pittsburgh media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is in demand in the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come and try to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political researcher at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows belly for battle to keep hope alive on the singles on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes could only be what this Ryder Cup thug.
The swinging pendulum of momentum is a completely invented sport term, but one that players really believe in, and never more than in competitions like these.
So where would they say moment is now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now there are four, so we take it as a little moment , I guess," Jordan Spieth said as he walked off for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points leading with twelve more in play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they have some wind in their sails, and they have a lot to be encouraged by, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day, and each has three points from four.
Spieth has been deadly from tee to green and hires by example.
The guttural screams of the celebration were higher as his round continued, searching an important putt to take match four all-squao.re when he and Thomas had been two down after two.
His putt who won the game at 15, was met with a similar scream, the type who tells you that he thinks the American team is not out of this.
"You've really only got to dig deep and worry about your own fight," Spieh said.
That's all each of these players has left now.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the invincible story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange but cute couples are four out of four and can't make any mistake.
"Moliwood" was the only couple not to shoot a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and back nine (the last nine holes on a 18-hole course) on Friday morning.
That race, and the way their energy seems to flow both to and from this noisy, engaged audience, cements that they are the players to be beaten on Sunday, and there would be no more popular players to seal a potential European say when the sun goes down over Le Golf National, than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
Talking about European honors will be even too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did short work by Sergio Garcia, the morning four-ball hero, when he was the couple with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double on the first nine, the Spaniard and the Swede dug into a hole they never came close to climbing out of.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interaction between opponents, advice they give, and advice they don't give and the way a strategy can change at a moment's notice.
Europe has played better as a team so far and takes a significant lead into the last day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has the stomach of the game that someone, especially Stateside, had doubted.
Europe takes 10-6 lead in Ryder Cup final
Europe will have a healthy advantage into the last day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's four-balls and foursome games with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari rented the charge with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their game so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side fined keeping the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a misguided American side tomorrow fourballs, and took the series 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in foursomes and won two games, but they could not bring in the undershot.
Jim Furyk's side need eight points from the 12 single games on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points while he and Molinari, called "Molliwood" after a startling weekend, are only the second pair to win four points from their opening in four games in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they so handsomely set out to beat an outspoken Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more coveted 5 and 4.
Woods, who struggled through two games on Saturday, showed sporadic brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who quivered for the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2 and 1 defeat by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – ranked one and three in the world.
Europe still did not get everything they wanted on a cozy, windy day southwest of Paris.
Three-time big winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas put the reference to the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They won a brave 2 & 1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and returned later to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursomes when they had lost the two holes in the opening.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point base and entered singles, although as holders Furyk's side only need to draw to retain the trophy.
However, after being the second best in two days, it looks like a Sunday counterattack will be outside of them.
North Korea says it's not about to rust down unilaterally without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations Saturday that if sanctions continue, the distrust of the United States will increase and that the country would in no way give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Government's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures" to improve conditions in the past year, for example, they have stopped nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear test site and promise not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we are not getting anything equivalent back from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances it is not possible that we unilaterally disarm first."
While Ri, a well-known North Korean, has made several complaints about Washington's opposition to a "phased" approach to the abolition of nuclear weapons, in which North Korea would be paid to take gradual steps, his resignation proved significant by not rejecting unilateral nuclear decommissioning, as Pyongyang has done previously.
Ri referred to a joint statement drafted by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit ever between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work for "decommissioning nuclear power on the Korean Peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has wanted a formal end to the 1950–53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted talks to ease tough international sanctions in North Korea.
"The United States insists on "destruction of nuclear power first" and increases the pressure of sanctions to achieve its purpose of coercion, and they even oppose "the declaration of making peace," Ri said.
"The belief that sanctions can crack us is a false hope among those who are not interested in us.
But the problem is that as the sanctions continue, our distrust only increases."
Ri mentioned nothing about the plans for a new summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. President highlighted in the UN earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister emphasized three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae-in, over the past five months and added: "If the party in this call for nuclear weapons to be dismantled was South Korea, and not the United States, the decommissioning on the Korean Peninsula would not have stopped as it has now done"
Yet the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the General Assembly of the F.N. that it was not possible to stop North Korean missiles against the U.S. mainland, after evil President Trump called Kim a rocket man on suicide missions.
Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much work still had to be done and that sanctions had to remain in place until North Korea dismantles its nuclear weapon.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a time frame for this, saying, "If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the F.N. Security Council should pay Pyongyang for the measures taken.
But the United States Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, told the F.N. Security Council on Thursday that: "The sanctions of the Security Council still need to be maintained vigorously and without failing until we get the complete, final, verified decommissioning of the nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to throttle Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile program.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the F.N. General Assembly and afterwards said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea condemns him for making "gangster-like demands."
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States made "equivalent measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "equivalent measures" he was seeking were security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore, and steps towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses in getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has contributed to all students getting more sleep, in an effort to fight against the growing macho culture that involves studying in caffeine throughout the night. That means using caffeine to stay awake all night to study.
An academic found that top university students often careless when it comes to the very most basic - how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact sleep deprivation has on learning.
"At the end of that, a girl came up to me and said, "Why am I being told this now, in adulthood?"
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleeping - which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, rolled out for the first time this year, explains what is important to how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and managing director of the university's health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after students got seriously worse sleep during the week.
The hour-long course involves a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a dormitory, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, coaches and books to be told about the effect of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, as well as the importance of evening routines.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
'We know it won't change the behavior of students right away.
But we think they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know, the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes, Prof. Czeisler added.
The 24-hour pride culture still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students means that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Ensuring that you get enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's secret weapon against stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said—even avoiding gaining weight, since sleep deprivation puts the brain in starvation mode and makes them constantly starving.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, having been a student with him last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push on to get a course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study program before starting at the prestigious institution.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students should consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed, and also for when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" coming from electronic screens and LED lighting, and which can change the internal clock overall, leading to problems falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga goals give Gerrard's men down
The Rangers went on another defeat on the away field when Dolly Menga's post sent Steven Gerrard's undisclosed side to a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking to take their first win on the away field since the 4–1 triumph at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team only caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as leader, giving eight points, a round under Ladbroke's Premier League leader, Hearts.
The menga hit seven minutes before half-time, and a Ranger lineup of missing inspiration never seemed to equalize.
As Rangers now fall down to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and is only behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there may be additional problems in storage for the Rangers after the lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a wound in the head, after an object apparently was thrown from the away side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that swept Ayr into the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt , on the other hand, went with Livy 11 taking a point with a slow shot last week, and he would have been thrilled by the way his well-groomed outfit took the suffocation cap on his opponents on each shift.
The Rangers might have had the ball the most , but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They should have scored after only two minutes when Menga's first post sent Scott Pittman over to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder failed in his giant chance.
A long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot far at the return inlay.
The Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than belief in their game in the last third round.
Alfredo Morellos knew determined that he would have a penalty on the 20 metre mark when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson waved away the wish of the Colombian.
Rangers only managed two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goaltender Liam Kelly was hardly concerned by Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tame shot from Oviedo Ejaria.
While Livi's opening in the 34th minute may have been against the playing rules, no one can deny that they ignited it just because of the "shot".
Again, the Rangers failed to handle a deep dead ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher hit Scott Robinson's ball, which remained cool to pick out the Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard left in the break as if he traded Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the switch caused an immediate effect when the winger made a hatch for Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed forward to block.
However, Livingstone continues to outwit the guest team to play exactly the game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett sending out longshots on longshots.
Holt's team could have increased their lead at the end, but McGregor succeeded in preventing Jacobs in it, until Lithgrow added a long post from the corner mark.
Ranger's reserve, Glenn Middleton, had a new claim for punishment when he supported with Jacobs, but again Thomson oversaw it.
Almanac: The inventor of the geiger counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today, and VI REKNAR ... the day he who would become physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that ultimately led to the apparatus known as the Geiger counter.
As a scientific support bar ever since then, the Geiger counter was also a support bar in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with the seemingly improbable late cowboy researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Mann: "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, it can be used to find radioactive minerals, for example uranium.
When you put these earphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that come from the radioactivity of the minerals."
Evans: "Yes, now it bubbles!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that calls on his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" red cells.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" red cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize red cells, as part of the treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, and changing them in the laboratory

A sample vaccine shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with vacsina, who teaches the immune system to recognize red cells, experienced ovarian cancer disappearing for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, modifying them in the laboratory, allowing them to "see" a protein common in many cancers, called HER2, and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "drives the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to extract immune cells from patients and "learn" them how they target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West commissioned a Pro-Trump Diatribe, wearing a MAGA hat, after he guested the TV show Saturday Night Live. .
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was piped out in the studio during Saturday Night Live after an incredible performance in which he praised the United States President, Donald Trump, and said he would run for office in 2020.
After taking his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, where he was wearing a Make America Great-caps, he gave the Democrats a tirade and repeated his support to Trump.
"So many times I talk to a white person, and they say, "How could you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago, he said.
SNL started the show with a number along with comedian Matt Damon, in which Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate Judiciary Committee on the charges of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the footage of West's tirade was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to taunt West with the post.
West had also complained to the public that he had the difficult backstage due to his headgear.
"They bullied me behind the scene.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on."
They bullied me!
And then they say I'm in a sunken place," he said, according to the Washington Examinor.
West continued: "Do you want to see the sunken spot?" saying he would "take on the Superman cap, because this means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments led to piping out at least twice from the audience, and SNL cast members seemed embarrassedly affected, Variety reported, with a person there telling the publication: "The whole studio was doomed."
West was brought in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, when her former girlfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confused many with a performance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received the support of the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous spirits: Thank you for standing up against the scourge."
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West "just was like he is and it's absolutely amazing."
"But I did NOT choose to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his 'art') that I think embraces and spews ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
That's us too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Medrappar, Snoop Dogg is named Snoop Lion and of course the last music legend Prince, changed the name to a symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington faces toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-turning role as Jon Snow in HBO's select medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has gone out against the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen often cause young boys to feel they have to be tough to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he thinks something has gone wrong and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he knows "quite strongly" to address the problem.
"Personally, I'm informed that something has gone wrong with masculinity." he said.
"What have we learned men when they grow up, when it comes to the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that TV is partially responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to very male characters.
He continues: ‘What is innate and what is being taught?
What is taught on television and in the streets, what makes young boys feel that they must be this particular side of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions of our time - how do we change that?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men.'
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make Game of Thrones precursors or sequels when the series ends this summer, saying he is "finished with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will play in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he is looking at the meeting with his wife Rose to be the best that came out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this show, so that way it gave me my future family and my life on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the award-winning to Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are framed in the country, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV quickly spread through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the amount of people who received HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, Chinese health professionals said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, from year to year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT/HBTQ people is claimed to be widespread.
Due to the conservative values in the country, studies have talfirmed that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies adding lacquer information from GOP senator, it explodes in 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'.
United States Rep. Maxine Waers on Saturday condemned allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information about three Republican U.S. Senators on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the allegations were pedalled by "extreme-right wing" investigations and websites.
"Lies, lies, and more contemptible lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The released information apparently included home addresses and phone numbers of the Americans Sens. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday, was sent by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on the charges of sexual assault against Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and released the information to a member of Waters' staff, Hill reported.
"This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continues.
"One of my employees—who has had their identity, personal information, and security compromised as a result of these unreasonable and false claims—was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
Water's interrogation quickly received online criticism, including from former White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that she has no temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
They must not be tough.
They must not question the motives of the shoulder.
They must be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer proved to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats by Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being apparently angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate attempting to take over Waters' place in the mid-term election, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if that's true," he tweeted.
In her resignation, Waters said her office had alerted "the right governments and the law enforcement units of these false allegations.
"We will make sure the perpetrators are revealed," she continues, "and that they will be held legally responsible for all their actions that are devastating and dangerous to each and every one of my associates."
Johnny English strikes again - spy toll of weak Rowan Atkinson
It is traditional to look for Brexit notables in all new films with a British angle, and it seems current for this revival of Johnny England's action-comedy spoof-franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will self-ironic satire that re-enact how openly unsle we are become the new export capability in the country?
In any case, the big-eyed, incompetent Johnny English with the rubber ducklet has for the second time had his renewed permission to fuck things up - his name signals more than anything else that he is a broad comedy creator for cinematographers in non-English-language countries.
He is, of course, the foolish, secret agent who despite his bizarre wishes to spread a little glamour has received a little bit of Clouseau, a dash of Mr Bean and a portion of the guy who contributes a simple melody to the Fire Trucks, theme during the London 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony.
He is also originally based on the traveling and international mysterious man Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, leaving chaos behind.
There are one or two fine moments in this last JE excursion.
I loved Johnny English approaching a helicopter while he was dressed in a medieval armor suit while the rotor blades hit his helmet.
Atkinson's gift to physical comedy is on screen, but the humor feels quite weakened and strangely redundant, especially since "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible even now confidently offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it's aimed at children instead of adults, and for me Johnny England's noisy accident is not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's replica-clause clothes in the person of Bean.
The permanent current assumption now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's super secret web network of spies, which uncovers the identities of all agents Britain has on the field, to the dismay of the agent at work - a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and war-torn figure, who already has a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does his very best with this quasi-Theresa-May character, but there is not so much in the script to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that once every active spy has been charged, she must bring in someone who has been retired.
And that means that the incompetent Johnny English himself, who works as a teacher at a somewhat elegant establishment , but gives unofficial lessons on how to work undercover: a couple of fine jokes here, since English offers a School of Rock-type academy for espionage.
English is sent back to Whitehall for a emergency briefing and reunited with his former understanding assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, moving over to a submarine driver's job, an overenthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin's ability to make things go terribly wrong in Her Majesty's Secret Services is back to full in the face of Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls dangerously under the charismatic technology of the billionaire enchantment, who claims that he can solve Britain's computer problems: the eerie Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of farce-like wild game: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a fine French restaurant; they create chaos and smuggle themselves aboard Volta's yacht; and English triggers pure anarchy as he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
All stopped are certainly pulled out to the last sequence, but as gracious and undisciplined as it is, there is quite a lot of children's TV all over.
Quite moderate things.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talents?
Labour Party Labour denies that they are preparing a plan for the English to work a four-day week but are being paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party is now considering a radical plan that wants the British to work a four-day week - but gets paid for five.
The party will, according to the report, send corporate executives further savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to employees, by giving them an extra day off.
Then employees would be able to enjoy a three-day weekend - but still receive the same pay.
Sources said the idea would "fit" with the party's economic agenda and plans to increase benefits for employees.
The change to a four-day week has been approved by Trades Union Congress as a way for employees to benefit from the changed economy.
An older source from Labour told The Sunday Times: A policy message is expected to be announced before the turn of the year.
'It doesn't happen overnight, but a four-day work week is a wish that fits into the approach the party has to balance the economy in favor of the worker, as well as superior to the party's industrial strategy.'
The Labour Party would not be the first to endorse such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week in its 2017 campaign.
However, the ambition is not currently approved by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'A four-day work week is not party politics and it is not considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell spent last week's work conference to enhance his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to reclaim power from "faceless directors" and "profits" in wealthy businesses.
The plans of the shadow chancellor also mean that current shareholders in the water companies cannot recover their entire efforts as a Labour government could make "reductions" due to perceived mishaps.
He has also confirmed plans to put employees in company boards and create Inclusive Ownership Funds (including ownership funds) to provide 10 percent of equity in private sector enterprises to employees, which would receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500, approximately $5,000.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, tells in the TV program "60 Minutes" if FBIs in investigation of Kavanaugh could have them change their minds
The FBI investigation into complaints against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and it raises the question of the extent to which the finding of the agency could affect some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview sent Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley in "60 Minutes" asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, if the FBI could reveal anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said on my way into the hearing, I said, I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, that claim came out and said, 'Have you done it?'
He was determined, determined, and oblivious.”
Graham's voice seems to have been seen in stone.
"I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would take a dynamite charge to change me," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it, " Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all she names could not confirm it.
That's 36 years.
I see nothing new changed."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York hosts the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features an enormously impressive array of stars performing and an equally impressive mission; ending poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flocking to Central Park's vast lawn, not only enjoying seeing Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes perform, but also increasing awareness of the true goal of the event to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concert viewers had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering; sending emails to a world leader, calling a phone call, or other meaningful ways to help increase awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been at 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way of persuading people to demand a call for action, or just another case of so-called "click-tivism" - people feel that they are making a real difference by signing an online appeal or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, participating in and pushing for a variety of goals.
It states that these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group showed 390 commitments and announcements as a result of their actions, of which at least $10 billion have already been paid out or collected.
The group estimates that the secured funds so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a British-based partnership of investors and entrepreneurs committed to "helping children reach their full potential"; promising to give Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," - told the ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after taking more than 5,000 actions to require Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the British government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional treatment.
In response to one of the common questions on their website, they ask, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global citizen replied, "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements lead us, we will be lynched, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among some of the actors performing at this year's New York event, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Fleet as a "block" to prevent Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
Washington may "if necessary" resort to its fleet to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, International Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where they operate at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to convey energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he reportedly said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has this ability, with our Fleet, to ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal group presenting itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
"The economic solution to Iran and Russia is more or less to utilize and replace fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The declarations come as the Trump administration has been commissioned to increase exports of liquid natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
In connection with this, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump, try to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin the "captain".
Moscow has repeatedly underlined that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's eager opposition to the project is driven only for economic reasons, and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the stance that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. attitude has withdrawn backlash from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state disrupts our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, leader of the German Industrial Association (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "run hard" to run for president in 2020, Massachusetts Senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would take a "deep look" at running for president after the midterm election.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running as a candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our bad government, and that includes a woman at the top," she said according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will consider thoroughly running for president."
Warren admitted to President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting and said that he “leads this country in the wrong direction.”
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren has been critical of his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's own voters do not think she should run as a candidate in 2020.
51 percent of "true" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run as a candidate, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/ Boston Globe survey.
Thirty-two percent supported such a candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a round of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed with respect to a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin argues for Track Palin’s PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after being enlisted in September.
He was arrested and charged with an election incident at home on Monday night
"What my own son goes through, what he goes through when he comes back, allows me to relate to other families marked by PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers return with," she told the audience at a gathering for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in space" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they come back a little changed, they come back the herd, they come back and wonder if the respect for what they and fellow soldiers and pilots and all other military, have done for the country, exists".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was charged with physical violence in the home against a woman, for disrupting a report of violence in the home and storing a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support challenge to new asylum policy
Eighteen states and districts in Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and district filed a friend-of-court brief Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker challenging politics, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name in Grace v. Sessions fits the fact that the American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Freedom Union) filed in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and the elected gang member sons" abused her, but U.S. officials denied her application for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers of the States that support Grace, describe El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produce a large amount of applicants for American asylum, which nations face pervasive problems with gangs and violence in the home.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision from the Immigration Act, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing violence in the home, to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignors many decades of state, federal, and international law."
"Federal law requires all asylum cases to be judged for the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such an obstacle contravenes this principle," said friend-of-court brief.
Lawyers further claimed in the summary that policies that deny immigrants access, harm the U.S. economy, and say they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "offer necessary work".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer provide asylum to victims fleeing abuse and gang violence in June.
"Asyl is available to those who leave their homeland due to persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in its June 11 announcement of the policy.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate any problem—even any serious problem—that people face every day across the world.
Desperate rescue work in Palu while the death toll doblast in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation became increasingly serious.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who consoled her feverish baby zone at an evacuation center in the ruined city, Palu.
"Every minute, ambulances come with bodies.
Clean water is hard to find."
Residents have been observed on their way back to their destroyed homes, searching through water-damaged properties and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals destroyed by the earthquake, which had a magnitude of 7.5, were crowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had broken his back and shoulder, suffocated outside Palu's Military Hospital, where patients were treated outside due to still strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes while telling him he knew the powerful earthquake shook the hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I think, "told Haris to the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife calling for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. Ambassador blames China for "bullying" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a 4-page advertisement in an American daily newspaper and highlighted the mutual benefits of trade with the United States and China, the U.S. Ambassador accused China of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to China Daily's paid grants in the Des Moines register – the state's largest salsa newspaper – after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6, a charge China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to support trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that has seen them in turn raise taxes on each other's imports.
China's retaliation tariffs early in the trade war were designed to meet exporters in states such as Iowa supporting Trump's Republican party, Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had injured U.S. workers, farmers, and businesses.
"China," Branstad wrote in a poll in Sunday's Des Moines register, "is now doubling the bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In its dissemination of propaganda, the Chinese government uses America's beloved tradition of free speech and a free press by posting a paid ad in the Des Moines register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newsstand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited dissenting voices and will not see any true reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's problematic economic path, given that the media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party "writing him.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers declined the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which of a newspaper.
Republicans alienate female voters ahead of midterm with Kavanaugh Debacle, warns Analysts.
As many top Republicans are stand-by and defending Supreme Court elector Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple charges of sexual assault, the analyst has warned that they will probably see a setback, especially from women, in the upcoming mid-term elections.
The feelings surrounding this have been extremely high, and most Republicans are on have recorded that they already wanted to move forward with a voice.
These things cannot be undone, says Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, to The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) last minute pressure for an FBI investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they are not going to forget it tomorrow, and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday. Washington, DC newspaper.
On Friday morning, Protestants sang "November is coming!" while demonstrating in the hall of the Senate when Republicans, who run the court committee, chose to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to be outside the chart," Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told the news page.
"People say it's already been high, that's true.
But it can get higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29-year-olds, who, while not liking the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony as detailed, the allegations of sexual assault directed against incumbent Supreme Court nominees, analysts suggested that a setback could follow if Republicans pushed forward with the confirmation.
"This has been a confused mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chair of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote of the committee or final vote or whether Kavanaugh is seen on the bench, it's also about how Republicans have handled this and how they've treated her," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that contributes to electing Democrats, pointed to for the news channel.
But the Americans seem to be a bit divided over who to believe in in the wake of Ford's and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little more siding with the latter.
A new poll by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying under his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, and also at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee under the ownership last week that Kavanaugh completely assaulted her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her genitals while attending a party during the time they studied at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet to meet Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where data is stored and which people have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the meaning of Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solids technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data warehouse" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, memorabilia, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive; Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in a browser and all at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online store is that it is entirely up to the user who can access all kinds of information.
The company calls it "personal authority through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the managing director of the company John Bruce, is that the company should include resources, process and appropriate capabilities to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM and some added developers with contracts to work with the project, as well as a community of volunteer coders.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about not introducing a complete change where all their business models are completely turned on their heads overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a media post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new online collection built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a voice with great influence in the debate on net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic for this next era online," Berners-Lee added ten l.
Bernard Water: WW1 Victoria Cross divinely celebrated
The only English church divine to win a Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter has been celebrated in its home town 100 years later.
Lt Col Pastor Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the highest British military honour.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it was "brilliantly symbolic", that the stone would be unveiled just 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning performance.
According to the London Gazette, Lt Col Vann leased his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918 "through a very thick shovel and under heavy fire from fields and machine guns."
He later ran up to the front line, and with the "greatest gallantry" the line led forward before alone rushing forward with a field gun and knocking out three of the group.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never live up to, but something I am humble for."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also added a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to play a role in the parade, adding that "the value of a real hero is shown by the support given by many people."
MMA fans were up all night to see Bellator 206, they got Peppa Gris instead
Imagine this, you've been up all night to see a packed Bellator 206 but then you don't get to see the main event.
The San Jose bill contained 13 games, including six on the main card and was shown live through the night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just in what Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald are preparing to meet, viewers in the UK were again stunned when coverage changed to Peppa Gris.
Some were little impressed after they had stayed awake until the early hours especially for the game.
A fan on Twitter described byte to the children's comics as "a kind of sick joke."
"It's public regulation that at 6 a.m. if the entrance wasn't appropriate like this, then they had to switch to the children's program," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about the transfer.
"The Peppa Pig, "Yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they should work on planning to include British viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think about replay, I think we can probably figure it out," Coker said.
"But the clock is six in the morning on a Sunday, and we don't find out this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it went over, there were a lot of texts going back and forth, and everyone wasn't friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it was not; it was a public problem.
I can promise you, next time it won't happen.
We keep it to five games instead of six—as we usually do—and we tried to hand it over to the fans, and we just went over.
It’s an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "beautiful" due to sexuality
Olympic plunger Tom Daley says that as he grew up he felt worse than anyone because of his sexuality—but that gave him the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he went to secondary school that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about gays' rights to give others "hope".
He also said becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The regular reporter in the cross-country shows, Kirsty Young, has taken off for months due to illness.
What might look like an escape in Laverne's first program, Daly said he felt "less than" everyone else growing up because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, has the feeling of feeling less than and feeling different, were the real things that have given me the power and strength to be lynched."
He would prove that he was "something", he said, so he did not disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic medalist has been a professional LGBT campaign and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live open without entanglements and wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – "surprised me."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he went to his first Olympics 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar heights and downturns.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his entire "his" perspective had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was all about I need to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked for was if they had tickets to London 2012 - when he wanted to be on the first row.
"I couldn't tell him you're not going to be on the front row," he said.
"I held my hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally recognized he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew this was what I had dreamed of my whole life - diving in in front of a home audience at an Olympic game, where fans had no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song choice – Proud of Heather Small – which had vibrated with him in the build-up to the Olympics and still gave him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs are on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out of shape sit Mickelson on the bench at the Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he must turn his form to avoid being an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who played in the two-year event for a record 12th time, was seen on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk within Saturday's golf game in fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time winner split his day between being a cheerleader and working on his game within the reach of the hope of correcting what bothers him.
Not even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is best at hitting with the long shot on the cramped, French main course, where balls hit outside if the golfer is not accurate with the strokes.
And if the path itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson meets in the ninth game on Sunday, the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, four points down by starting the 12 single games, make it to a warm start, Mickelson's game can be completely decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say much else.
"He completely understood the role he had today, gave me a pat on my back and laid his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has great confidence in himself.
He is a Hall of Famer, and he has added so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he played two games.
I looked for me more, but that's how it was, and that's how we thought we had to do.
He will be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record in most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It may mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite matched the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his proximity added some intangible features to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, entertaining, likes to keep fun with people and he's a nice guy to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun having a chat with him as well, this week, which was fun to see.
He contributes a lot more than just playing."
Europe captain Thomas Bjorn knows that big lead can soon disappear
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead on the way into the last day's Ryder Cup singles can easily be turned into an unpleasant ride.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where a side captain of Seve Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans, but only came across the finish line with his nose leading by the narrowest margins, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You continue to remind you that we had a great lead at Valderrama; we had a great lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only barely," said Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, after seeing Classa 2018 win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on that team that this is not over.
You're going to the full opening tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win this trophy, and that is where the focus remains.
I've been saying all along, I'm focusing on the 12 players that are on our side, but we're so well aware of what's going on on the other side - the biggest players in the world."
Glad at how his players have performed on a tough golf course, Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn added: "I would never take the lead.
Tomorrow is another day.
Tomorrow, it's the individual achievements that come out, and that's another thing to do.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you’re out there individually, you’ll be fully tested out of your capacity as a golfer.
It's the message you need to convey to players; get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner, and he has to go and get the best out of himself as well."
In contrast to Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, opposite number Jim Furyk will be on the lookout for his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who fetched three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been at both ends of the turnarounds in the last few days, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before he quit as a loser when Europe left "The Miracle of Medinah."
"I remember every fucking word of it," he said in response to being asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had gathered his players on their way into the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to get started with the quick start that you saw at Brookline, which you saw at Medinah.
When that moment gets to go one way, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We set up our line-up accordingly and set the boys off in a way that feels good, you know, we're trying to do something magical tomorrow" .
Thomas has been assigned the task of trying to lead the game and meets Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the scheme.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think it covers all the way through," Bjorn said of his choices of singles.
Germany's new warships postponed yet again
The latest frigate to the German Navy would have been ordered in 2014 to replace aging warships from the Cold War era, but it will not be there until at least next year due to incorrect system and skewed costs, local media reported.
Launching the Rheinland-Pfalz, the leadership of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, which cites a military spokesman.
The vessel was supposed to have joined the fleet in 2014, but the worrying problems after delivery plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships the Navy ordered back in 2007, come as replacements for the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will contain a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from the ports at home level.
Yet continuous delays mean that the pioneering warships, which supposedly allow Germany to exercise power abroad, will already become outdated when entering service, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to accept the vessel and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the German fleet has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of important "software and hardware flaws" that made the warship useless if deployed on a combat task.
Software failures were particularly important as the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a crew of around 120 sailors – only half of the labor force on older Bremen frigates.
It was also found that the ship is dramatically overweight, reducing performance and limiting the ability of the fleet to add future upgrades.
The 7000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from the wrong hardware, the price of the entire project—including crew training—is also a problem.
It is said to have reached staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – up from initial €2.2 billion (EURO)
Problems associated with the newest frigates become particularly important in light of the latest warnings that Germany's fleet power is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the fleet actually "has almost ended distribution-competent ships".
The officer said the problem has been built over time, because old ships were discontinued, but no replacement vessels were delivered.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were able to join the fleet.
National Trust Thieves on Secret Life of Bats
New research conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how the bats use the landscape in pursuit of food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study of researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano pipistrelles and also brown long-eared and daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in important locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Expert audio analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat conversations and what species do what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, natural science advisor to NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat, natural homes, which are most important to the bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the acquisition of meadows and how it is best to maintain equal forest areas for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the United Kingdom have decreased significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects rest areas and loss of habitat/residential sites.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, such as flypaper and some chemical treatments of building materials, and also attacks of pet cats.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are still more useful than their eyes in catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to find errors and obstacles in their flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes the bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, rest inspections, and sometimes save lives.
The organization has even created Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve on the Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave we have a great area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many veteran trees and all the good habitats.
But there is a lot about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive."
He underscores the importance of checking for bats before performing maintenance within real estate, since it is possible that the infinite destruction of a single habitat can kill up to 400 women's bats and young people, and perhaps eradicate an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their resting places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to come in and help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are dangerous."
Ronaldo Rejects Election Detention Debts in What Lawyers Defend German Magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled the rape charges against him as "false news", saying that people "want to highlight themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are set to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
Portugal and the Juventus forward have been accused of electing an American woman, called Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is claimed to have paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live instagram video, Ronaldo, 33, says to his 142 million followers just hours after the charges, that the charges are "false news."
"No, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news, says five times the Goldball winner into the camera.
"They want to market themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They will be known to say my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and all good, "let the player smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "an inadmissible reporting of suspicions within the area of privacy", according to Reuters
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damage in an amount equal to the severity of the rule violation , which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 at a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, claiming to have chosen her anal, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the supposed incident and told that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" and failed by "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographs taken of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed on an equalization because she felt "frightened by retaliation" and was concerned about "being publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to change residence as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to Italian giant Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'would forever regret' losing automakers
Britain "would regret it forever" if it lost its status as a world leader in post-Brexit car manufacturing, business secretary Greg Clark has said.
He added that it was "about" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston factory, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the effect of border delays in case a non-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, where 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we are seeing production stops at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have raised fears of leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns surrounding what car manufacturers say are the supply chains' risks in the event of a non-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is powered on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars ordered.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, disruptions at the border that the industry says can lead to delays and lack of parts may occur.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, thus stopping production.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Checker's plan for future relations with the EU is "just calibrated to avoid controls at the border."
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow, as I say, not only to enjoy the success today, but for us to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's daily program.
"The evidence from not only Toyota, but other manufacturers is that we absolutely must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term they warned that additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years, and is the Unite Union Association at the plant, said that his members are more concerned with: "After my experience, when these jobs go, they never return.
A spokesperson for the government said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump's high-ranking meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "pressed back a week" as the fight against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election interference, links between Trump supporters and Russia and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Corvidly Trump will say up to the general of the prosecutions or not, thus putting Mueller's independence at risk, has fueled Washington's gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing a lease to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president using the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and it was reported that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid crashing with the Senate Commission hearing where both Kavanaugh and one of the women who has charged him with sexual harassment, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "There has been no date set. It may be this week, but I can and see that it will be delayed another week because of everything else that happens in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the pressure up to date."
Some reporters will probably disagree with it: Sanders has not held a press briefing for the White House since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said the lack of briefings was not due to a discontent with TV reporters' play for the gallery, though she said, "I'm not disagreeing with them doing that."
She mentioned and that direct contact between Trump and the press is going to increase.
"The president holds more press conferences than any president has done before," she said - right enough without making any evidence for the claim. "We've looked at the numbers."
Sanders says updates will still happen, but "if the pressure gets the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We've tried to do it like this part, and you've seen us do it often in the last few weeks, and it's going to take over instead of a press orientation if you can talk directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly welcomes questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
It is unusual for the president to hold press conferences alone.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, where he performed leading reporters without shame, and almost bizarre.
Health Secretary writes about Brexit fears of EU workers at NHS in Scotland
The Health Secretary has written to EU workers working at the NHS in Scotland to express gratitude and a desire that they continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter although it is less than six months left before Britain withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to taking on the costs of applications whose status is decided for EU residents working in delegated public services.
In the letter, Freeman wrote the following: "During the summer, negotiations on withdrawal between the UK and the EU have continued, and it is approaching the expected conclusion this fall.
Nevertheless, the British government has stepped up preparations in case there will be no deal.
I understand that this must be a difficult time for you all.
Therefore, I will now repeat how much I value the contributions of all employees, no matter what nationality they have.
Colleagues from the EU, and outside, bring with them valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve work in the health sector and are beneficial to patients and communities.
Scotland is clearly your home, and we would like you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes acute surgery after head injury
Linebacker Christion Abercrombie, who plays on the Tennessee State Tigers, went through an emergency operation after pulling on an injury in his head when the team lost 31–27 to Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reports The Tennessean newspaper.
Head coach for Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the break.
"He came to the sideline and collapsed, somehow," Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him back for further evaluation.
An official Tennessee State spokesman, the WSMV told Abercrombie had finished operating at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
There is no detail about the extent of the injury yet, Harris said, adding that Tennessee State is still trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie attends university for the second year, and is in his first season after being transferred from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles before being injured in Saturday's game, and is now up to 18 in total this season.
Foreign buyers must pay a higher document fee when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers must pay a higher document fee when buying property in the UK. The extra income should be used to help the homeless, according to the new plans of the Conservatives
The decision will neutralize Corbyn's success by attracting young voters
The increase in document fees will be added to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The state treasury expects an increase of up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year - to help the homeless
Theresa May will today announce that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher document fee when buying property in the UK. The extra income will be used to help the homeless.
This decision will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success Jeremy Corbyn has had in attracting young voters who earn a lot, promising to offer reasonable housing.
The increase in document fees will be added to individuals and firms not paying taxes in the UK, and the extra money should strengthen the government's desire to reduce the number of circumventors.
The fee, which comes in addition to the current document fee, includes the higher levels introduced two years ago on the second- and second-place dwellings, can be as much as three percent.
The state treasury expects the decision to bring in up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
About 13 percent of new buildings in London are purchased by residents outside the UK, making prices higher, making it more difficult for first-time buyers to enter the housing market.
Many prosperous areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "spook towns" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time in other countries.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson would cut the document fee to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping prices up by obtaining property but not using them, and asked Theresa May to give up quotas on reasonable housing to fix Britain's "residential shame".
Corbyn has announced a series of conspicuous proposals for housing reforms, including controlled rent and the closure of expulsions for no reason.
He wants and gives advice greater power to build new dwellings.
May said, "Last year I said I would dedicate my position to bringing back the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
That means fixing the ruined housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
Nevertheless, it may not be right that it should be as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK, or foreign firms, to buy dwellings as it is for hard-working, British residents.
For many people, the dream of their own residence has ended too far away, and the humiliation of being a wanderer is real.
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland'
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says his "ultimate ambition" is to become manager of Scotland at some point.
The Scots (42) are happy about the challenge of reviving the club from the north-east. Currently, they are in third place in League One, only three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, having led St Mirren back to the Scottish major leagues last season.
"I would play for my country playing.
I got a B national team match, and that's it," Ross told Scotland's BBC Sportsound.
"But I grew up seeing Scotland at Hamden along with my father, and there has always been something that has drawn me back.
That possibility can only come if I'm successful as a club manager."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager, include Dick Advocate, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he has not been anxious to come by so many established names in such a large club, since he has previously declined approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, success for me will be measured in whether I 'can get this club back in the Premier League.'
Based on the structure and facilities of this club, there is no doubt that they belong in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get them there, but I can probably just look at myself as successful if I manage to get the club back there".
Ross is only three years into his career as a manager, after a term as assistant chief of Dumbarton and a 15-month term in Hearts' coaching apparatus.
He then helped Alloa recover from descent to third level, turning St Mirren, who was on his way to move down, into the championship series title winner the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now, than he ever did while playing in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"There was another road divide," he says of leading Alloa.
"I genuinely believed that being a manager suited me much better than being a player.
It sounds bizarre, because I did it well, lit well and liked it relatively well.
But playing can be tough.
There are many things you are left to get through each week.
I still notice it when it comes to the stress and pressure of the job, but it feels right to be a manager.
I have always wanted to be a manager, and now I am. It is the most comfortable I have felt in my own body throughout my adult life."
Sunday, September 30, you can hear the entire interview at Sportsound, Radio Scotland, between noon and 13 p.m.
Survey shows that the perfect time for a half-liter is at 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday
This summer's hot wave has led to an increase in the incidence of struggling pubs in the UK, but and increased pressure on restaurant chains.
In July, sales increased by 2.7 per cent in the bar industry – but for the restaurant industry, it declined by 4.8 per cent, the statistics show.
Business advisor Peter Martin, who is behind the statistics, said: "The current sun, and the fact that England were in the World Cup longer than planned, means that July followed the pattern for June where pubs went up 2.8 percent, only that restaurants became even harder framed.
The 1.8 percent decline in the restaurant business only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars selling drinks did significantly better and went up more than restaurants went down.
Pubs selling food received and noticed the decline in the sun, although it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
It may seem like people just want to go out for a drink.
Among pubs and bars, the drinking room had increased by 6.6 per cent this month, while food had declined three per cent.
Paul Newman, analyst for travel and leisure at RSM, said: "These results are the continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather, and the impact of a huge social or sports event, will still be the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the nightlife industry.
It is no surprise that the restaurant industry will still struggle. A decline in sales of 4.8 percent annually will be painful to get on top of a lagging cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not come at a worse time for food operators. The time will show whether the more moderate temperatures that have been in August can provide a long-awaited respite."
The total salsucking across pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in the release of brands.

One in five children has secret profiles on social media that they hide from their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret profiles on social media that they hide from parents and teachers, a survey shows
Survey of 20,000 students on further education reveals an increase in "false Insta" profiles
This news has increased fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a "head" profile they show their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - make profiles on social media that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students in advanced school revealed a sharp increase in "false Insta" profiles – a reference to the Instagram image sharing platform.
The news has increased the fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of students say they have a sterile "head" profile they refer to parents, while at the same time they and have private profiles.
A mother who stumbled across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager urging others to "validate me".
The research, done by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in various schools, found that 40 percent of those between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of these admitted to having private users.
The head of the HMC, Mike Buchanan, said, "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are being tempted to create places online where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle becomes the "athlete's voice" of the Scottish athletics board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics as a non-administrative director at the Board's annual general meeting.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland, and chairman Ian Beattie describes the event as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to take advantage of her extensive experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh has a lot of respect across Scotland, the UK and the world's track and field communities, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland can benefit from getting it into the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I am eager to serve as a voice for athletes, and I hope I can help contribute and help the sport in Scotland."
The American, who has gold from both 200m and 400m in Atlanta in 1996 among his total four Olympic golds and is now a regular guest at the BBC, was unable to go after a drip.
On Twitter, he wrote: "Today is a month since I got a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that it was only time that could tell me if I was going to be fine again, or to what extent.
It's been exhausting work, but I've become completely good again, learned to walk again, and today I'm doing flexibility boots!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Split opinions on the Internet about breast pump advertising that compares mothers to milk cows
A breast pump company has split public opinion on the Internet with an advertisement that compares breastfeeding mothers to dairy cows.
To mark what is described as "the world's first silent, sedentary breast pump", the technology company Elvie dropped a petty advertisement inspired by music videos to demonstrate the freedom the new pump provides to mothers who extract milk.
Four real mothers dance in a high-filled barn of cows, to a song that includes text such as: "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see any tails" and "In case you didn't notice it, these are not spanks, it's my tits."
The chorus continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed these children, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies".
The advertisement, however, published on the company's Facebook page, has generated controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, and many say it highlights the "fear" of the dairy industry.
“Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, only that the calves are trusted from them just days after birth," writes one.

Another commented: "Understandably enough traumatic for both mother and child
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another added, "What a reality-removed advertisement."
Others defended the advertisement, and a lady admitted that she thinks the song is "festive."
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would have one if I still breastfed.
Pumping made me feel net like a cow.
This advertisement is a little crazy, but I took it for what it is.
This is a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another commented: "This is a fun advertisement aimed at mothers pumping (often at work or on the toilets) and feeling like cows.
This is not an advertisement that boasts of or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they have all danced with the discreetly pumped wrapped into their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump, say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, has no leads or pipes, and its discrete inside a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move, keep their kids, and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balardin, partner and creative director of Mother, commented: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product, that it serves a daring and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between mothers extracting milk and milk cows, we wanted to highlight breast pumping and challenges associated with this, and at the same time demonstrate the incredible sense of freedom the new pump will bring, in an entertaining and recognizable way.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has made headlines.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two appeared on the podium for designer Marta Jakubowski, while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children moved in silence to tent camp on the Texas border
The number of imprisoned immigrant children has peaked although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part due to the strict policies the Trump administration has introduced making it more difficult to place the children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they fear that standing up and accepting a child can threaten their own possibility of staying in the country.
The risk of the increase in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult family members will be left to file fingerprints, and that this data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement testified before Congress and said the agency has arrested dozens of people who have applied to be sponsors of single minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had nothing on their record from before.
"Nearly 80 percent of those who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are illegal in the country, and a large part of these are criminal aliens.
So we're going to continue to pursue these people," said Albence.
According to those added to the camp, new rules have now been introduced to handle the children. The rules require that some of them now have to be in court before one month has passed, against the previous 60 days.
Many will attend via video calls and not at personal attendance, to have their case tried before an immigration judge.
Those who are not eligible for freedom will be deported quickly.
The longer the children are in custody, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to selective outbreaks or escape efforts, the camp officials say. Reports that have appeared in recent months say the same.
Proponents say these concerns are greater at large facilities such as Tornillo. Due to the size of the facility, it is more likely that signs of children struggling are overlooked.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally, or saying the hatred of friends, can reinforce trauma that many already struggle with.
Syria calls on U.S., French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked for Syrian refugees to come home, although the country is now at war on the eighth year.
Moualem, who and serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said that emerging forces are staying illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of defeating terrorism, and "will be treated in accordance with it".
"They must withdraw immediately and without preconditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, the more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been removed from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to "fight a holy battle until all Syrian territories have been cleansed" for both terrorist groups and the "illegal presence of strangers."
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
When talking about the refugee problems, Moualem said it was safe for them to come back, and he blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" about the environment that caused the refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return," he said.
"They're making policies out of something that would be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no help to bring about reconstruction in Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is in place.
United Nations diplomats say a recently formed agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, which is the last major rebel stronghold, has created a possibility to continue pushing forward with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement averted a major attack by Russian-backed, Syrian forces on the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem underlined that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will be directed against jihadists, including warriors from the nusra front, who are associated with Al-Qaeda, who "will be wiped out."
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to soon gather the first meetings of a new committee consisting of a government and opposition member to draft a post-war law for Syria, paving the way for the election.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the work of the panel should be limited "to review the articles of the current constitution," and warned against disturbances.
Why Trump is going to win another term
With that logic, Trump will win the 2020 re-election if not, as many liberal viewers likely hope, the presidency gets an early end due to scandals and impeachment.
It would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic end to a presidency ever!"
At the time of writing, there is no sign that viewers have been bored.
Since 2014, CNN has doubled its best-time rating to 1.05 million, while MSNBC has nearly tripled its rating to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in best broadcast time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has doctors on top of the cable rating with as much as 3.5 million viewers on evenings with big news.
"This is a fire that people are lured by, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer in the ABC drama "Designated Survivor," which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the congressional building.
Nell Scovell, old comedy author and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a ride in a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
Why that? she asked.
"Because he makes me laugh," he replied according to Scovell.
There is entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story coming from Washington may determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families may be left together and health to the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes further beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself in the sixth hour to see a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of sources with "deep background" for the book "Fear," Paul Manafort's bomb jacket of ostrich army at $15,000 ("a garment thick of Trump's arrogance," said the Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy's unhygienicity
Personally, I will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Parts of what he does that makes it feel like a reality program is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, daily leader of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about the show that takes place with Trump's employees and daily disputes (entering a game with the NFL, praise Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss a single episode, otherwise you don't hang out anymore.
When I met Fleiss this week, it was over 25 degrees and sun outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat in and watched MSNBC while recording CNN.
He was unable to turn away, not when Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate Commission and the future of the Supreme Court hung in a thin thread.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows before and people said, "This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization," Fleiss told us.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money from the outside flows into the densest midterm match
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district sees an abundance of money, thanks to a conversion of the districts of Congress that led to two sitting members fighting for the same seat.
It recently converted the suburban district of Pittsburg promotes Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district through a special election in the spring of last year.
Lamb is fighting another sitting member, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently a representative in the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th District.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January ruled that the old districts were illegally formed to benefit the Republicans.
The competition for the 17th district has launched a weapons draw on the financing of the campaigns, between the major parties' monetary arsenal, the Democratic Congressional Committee, and the Republican Congressional Committee.
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a button says in a closely followed special election in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat had been heard by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by over 20 points.
Political experts have given Democrats a scarce advantage.
The U.S. Considered Punishing El Salvador Due to Support for China, But Retired
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing without negative reactions from Washington.
Trump had a hot meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama to partners ejected the Trump organization's leadership group.
The state secretaries decided to bring back the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "last decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the ministry spokeswoman, in a statement early this month.
However, penalties were only assessed against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development, and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which contained cuts to financial support and targeted restrictions with regard to visas, would have been painful for the Central American country and their high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings developed, North American and Central American officials postponed a conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward to prevent immigrants coming to the United States.
However, in mid-September, the top administrators announced that they wanted the conference to continue, and therefore put an end to the assessment of the penalty for El Salvador.
It has now been said that Vice President Mike Pence will meet the conference, which has been scheduled in mid-October, as a signal to the relevance the administration places on the gathering, the diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new tough messages or punishments from Washington.
A Bolton spokesman would not comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations on the assumption of anonymity.
Their description was confirmed by an outside analyst who works closely with the administration and also spoke under the assumption of anonymity.
Studying History
Special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstructions of justice, for which there is now significant evidence in the public protocols.
According to the reports, Mueller is reported to have turned the focus of the investigation into whether Trump's campaign conspired with Russia idea attacks on our election.
If Congress were to change leaders, Trump will have to stand trial in this body, in which he prepares to persuade voters and possibly a jury of his peers.
There's a lot of "what if", and I don't mean to suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable—neither for his counterpart in Europe.
There are choices to take for all of us on both sides of the pond, which will affect how prolonged the fight can be.
In 1938, German officers became ready for a coup d'état against Hitler, had only the West opposed him and helped the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed a possibility to avoid the years of carnage this entailed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and democracy's relentless march is accelerated or postponed.
The Americans are facing several of these turning points now.
What will we do if Trump kicks Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in deep water ever since this paper revealed that last year he proposed to wiretap the president in secret, wondering if he is unfit for his role.
Rosenstein says The Times' description is inaccurate.
"How will we react if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or he is accepted by the Supreme Court despite credible charges of sexual assault, and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we in the midterms vote for a Congress that holds Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we're wrong, because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country I have my embassy in.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me off guard to light the Sabbath lights on the table asking the swastika.
When this is my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Rangers Graham Dorrans is optimistic before meeting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Australians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will give them a good starting point to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance this season before the 2-2 result against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a stepping stone to bigger things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We entered the game with the belief that we could get something, and came out again with a point.
Maybe we could take it to the end, but all in all, a draw is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and then we came out in the second half and were the better team.
On Thursday it will still be a big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game. They got a good result in their previous game, but with the audience behind us I'm sure we can run on and get a positive result.
The past year has definitely been tough, with everything that has happened to my injuries and the changes in the club, but now everything feels good.
The stable is good and the boys thrive; the training is good.
Hopefully we can run on now, put last season behind us and be successful."
Women Lose Sleep Over This Fear of Retirement Savings
Despite the fact that participants in a survey had clear thoughts about how they would be taken care of, few talked to family members about it.
About half of those who participated in a survey from the Nationwide insurance company said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of themselves, but they don't take the necessary steps to have that conversation," says Vice President of Nationwide, Holly Snyder.
Here you start.
Talk to your spouse and your kids: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t make your wishes known well in advance.
Collaborate with a counselor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these choices can be a big part of fixing the costs.
Get a financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
The long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term care insurance, a life insurance with cash value to help pay the expenses, or that you insure yourself with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Create legal documents: Avoid legal battles before they start.
Get a health authorization in place, so that you designate a person you trust to supervise your medical treatment and to ensure that professionals act in line with your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
You can also consider a power of attorney for your finances.
You should choose a person you trust to make financial decisions and make sure your bills are paid if you don't have the opportunity yourself.
Don't forget the little details: See for yourself that your old parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down all these details in a written plan, so you're ready.
"It's not just the finances it's about, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What kind of medication is it?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have the plan ready."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a severe earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, public officials say. The number of dead is expected to increase.
Without the possibility of communicating, aid workers have not received any information from Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the quake that had a magnitude of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster was a fact.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of central Sulawesi Province, and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island. The estimated population in 2017 was 379,800.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the quake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is an area that extends over more than 300 km of coastline to the northwest of the island.
The area, which is an administrative region lower than a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming is the berth of the economy of the central Sulawesi province, especially in the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is and important in the province, but is mostly concentrated to Morowali, on the other side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to the Disaster Reduction Office in Indonesia.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed and several hundred houses destroyed by a tsunami in Donggala.
In 1996, the western side of Donggala was hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific seismic fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the big quakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large quake on the west coast of Aceh Province in northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of major quakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Several hundred died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 quake hit southern Java, the most populated island in Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that crashed into the south coast killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 quake struck near the town of Padang, capital of Western Sumatra Province.
More than 1100 people lost their lives.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 quake hit one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of about 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A small quake hit Pidie Jaya area in Aceh causing destruction and panic when people were reminded of the quake and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 lost their lives due to buildings raging.
2018: Major quake hits tourist island Lombok and kills more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed several thousand buildings and left several thousand tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested and charged with domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor of Alaska and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested, charged with assault.
According to a report released by Alaska state police, Palin (29) was arrested on suspicion of violence in the home, involvement in reporting violence in the home and opposing arrest.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the offences.
Palin is jailed in the Mat-Su prison, and is held for bail $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court Saturday and declared himself "not guilty" when asked, quitting the network.
Palin faces three Class A mishaps, which means he can be jailed for up to one year and receive $250,000 in fines.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which can be punished with a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
It is not the first time Palin has been charged with any crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is up in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with attacks in the home, interfering in a reporting of violence in the home and possessing a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed that he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking his son's selective behavior to PTSD that originated when he served in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds lost their lives

The earthquake hit just outside the central part of Sulawesi, located northeast of the capital Jakarta.
Videos showing the dramatic moment when the quake hits, flourishing on social media.
Several hundred people had gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal prosecutors want rare death penalty for suspect in New York terror
Federal prosecutors in New York will have the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected in the terrorist attack that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been carried out for a federal offence in the state since 1953.
Saipov (30) reportedly used a car rental from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan in October, where he drove down pedestrians and cyclists on the road.
In order to justify a death penalty, prosecutors must be able to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "on purpose" and that he "on purpose" inflicted serious, bodily harm on them, according to a note filed in the southern district of New York.
Both of these events may be the basis for a possible death penalty, the court document states.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury handed over a list of 22 charges, including eight charges of murder with the aim of extortion of money, usually used by federal prosecutors in the context of organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and deliberation," said the prosecutors and described the way Saipov carried out the attack as "abominable, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused harm and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the note reads.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It is ten years since the last time the southern district of New York has sentenced the death penalty in a case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug suppliers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
On June 19, 1953, both were executed in the electric chair.
Saipov, originally from Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months that followed, according to court documents.
He told the detectives that what he had done was best known, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos from ISIS on the phone, the prosecution says.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He has not pleaded guilty at all charges.
David Patton, one of the federal, public defenders representing Saipov, says they are "clearly disappointed" with the decision of the prosecution authority.
"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty, rather than accepting a declaration of guilt for life in prison without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of the event for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked prosecutors not to go after the death penalty.
Tory Member of Parliament believes Nigel Farage should hire Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" today, during a protest at the Tory country meeting.
The former leader of the British Independence Party said that the politicians had to "feel the pressure" from the Eurosceptics - one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that he should hire the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative, mean Member of Parliament Peter Bone told the protesters in Birmingham that Britain "had been out" now, if Farage was Brexit minister.
With the challenge May faces of reconciling his deeply divided ranks has been underlined by a separate protest in the city, held by Tories who wish to stay in the EU.
The Prime Minister struggled to keep the plan with the Chequers compromise on the right track after attacks by the Brexiteers, Remainers as well as the EU.
Allies insist that she will push for a deal with Brussels, despite the setback – forcing the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between her package and "chaos".
Bone told Leave Means Leave grouping in Solihull that he wanted to "reject Chequers"
He suggested that Farage should have been given noble rank and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had ruled, we would be out now," he said.
The Member of Parliament from Wellingborough, added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must reject Chequers".
To mark his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be subordinate.
We will make our own laws in our own country".
Bone rejects the claim that the meaning of the people has changed since the 2016 election: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and wish to become, is completely false".
Brexit campaigner from Tory, Andrea Jenkyns, also participated in the march. She told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people!"
"Chequers are not popular in the population, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not popular in our party or our activists who frequent the streets and get us elected in the first place.
Please, drop Chequers and listen."
In a message addressed to May, she adds: "State ministers keep their jobs when they keep what they promise".
Farage said police officers must "feel the heat" should they come to betray the decisions made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that "we're not going to let them get away with it"."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want you to get the political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel the heat.
"We are mobilizing the people's army in this country that gave us say in Brexit and should not rest until we have become an independent, self-governing, proud Britain.
At the same time, the Remainers marched through the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour meeting in the centre.
A handful of activists waved "Tories Against Brexit" banners after launching the group this weekend.
Labour colleague Lord Adonis made fun of the Conservatives for security problems they had with a party app during the opening of the conference.
"This is the person who tells us that they can have all computer systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for a frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a total farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to take a "nice look" at running for the presidential election
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will take "a careful look at running for the presidential election" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from the Massachusett spoke about his future during a city meeting in the west of the Massachusett Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was but as a board member of Trump's 2016 campaign in the Mass House.
She has been the center of much speculation that she might want to try out against Trump in 2020.
The incident in Holyoke on Saturday, was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump acceded.
One contestant asked if she had plans to run for president.
Warren replied that it's time "that women take their trip to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrest done in the shooting of Louisiana State University player Sims
Baton Rouge police announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the case where basketball players from Louisiana State University (LSU), Wayde Sims, were shot and killed Friday.
At 11:00 local time, police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson (20), in a press conference for ET.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen on the video clip.
Sims (20) was shot and killed early Friday in the southern area of the university.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to his head and eventually died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media Saturday, writing 247sports.
Wayde went in to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
In turn, Simpson has admitted he was on the scene, with weapons, and admitted that he was shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without drama and placed in custody at the Department of Police in eastern Baton Rouge.
Sims played 32 games, ten of them from the start of the previous season, where he averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebounds in each game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team orders give victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team orders would have a major role in the race.
Bottas got a good start on the race, allowing Hamilton to take care of himself in defending his position for the first two rounds and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was first into the depot and allowed Hamilton to get into traffic at the rear of the trail, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes ran into the depot a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton ended up in front after some action side-by-side which left the Ferrari driver reluctant to leave the inside in danger of being unable to defend himself at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started, on his 21st birthday, in the rear row and placed seventh at the end of the first round.
After that, he led much of the race as he went for a quick finish with the goal of driving past Kimi Raikkonen who was in fourth place.
He entered the depot in the 44th round, but failed to increase his speed in the last eight rounds while the Raikkonen won fourth place.
It's a difficult day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend, and was a real gentleman who let me pass by.
The team has done an exceptional job having both first and second," said Hamilton.
It was really bad body language
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein at an election meeting Saturday due to her insistence that she does not lauch the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which she charges Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh for sexual assault.
During a speech at an election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not mention the testimony Ford had given to the Senate Commission directly, but rather commented that what is going on in the Senate showed that people were "bad and horrible and spoke false".
"The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last days of the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and bad and uncomfortable and talk false," he said.
"When you look at publications and leaks and then say, 'Oh, I didn't.
I didn't."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, do you paint it?
Do you remember her answer... did you paint the document - "Oh, eh, what?
Oh, no.
I don't paint it."
Wait a minute.
Laugh me... No, we don't laugh it," he added, mimicking the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with details of the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it was played earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charges, I don't paint her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, which she asked for."
But her denial did not fall into good ground with the president, who commented on it at Saturday's election meeting: "I say to you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
While continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who has been charged with poor sexual behavior by three women, the president proposed that the Democrats use the charges for their own gain.
"They are determined to take back power in every way they see necessary.
You see the badness, the badness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control," the president said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars - Belfast Giants (5-3)
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee stars compensated for the loss to the Belfast Giants on Friday by winning the return match 5-3 on Saturday.
The Giants received an early two-goal lead due to attacks from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized before Dwyer once again sent the Giants into the lead.
Francois Bouchard equalized for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the league this season for the boys of Adam Keefe, who defeated Dundee 2–1 in Belfast on Friday.
This was the fourth meeting between the teams this season, where the Giants have won the last three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute after an assist from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford served an assist to Beauvillier who doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan got the home team back into the game in the 14th minute, before Matt Marquardt made sure to equalize Cownie in the 16th minute.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants took the lead into the break as he scored his second goal for the evening at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard once again ensured an equalization with a brilliant goal after 27 played minutes.
Late in the second half, Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen obtain the Dundee lead for the first time in the game. He, on his side, secured the victory with the fifth goal of the team halfway in the last half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, face Milton Keynes at home in the next game, which is on Friday.
Flight leader loses his life to ensure hundreds of aircraft escape earthquakes
A flight attendant in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after he lost his life in what he continues to ensure that a plane of hundreds of passengers safely got into the air.
More than 800 people have lost their lives and many are slowed after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi and triggered a tsunami on Friday.
Strong aftershocks continue to disrupt the area, and many are trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
However, despite his colleagues fleeing for life, Anthonius Gunawan Agung (21) refused to leave his post in the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu, although it swayed wildly.
He remained again to ensure that the plane standing on the runway, Batik Air Flight 6321, took off safely.
He then jumped down from the control tower believing it collapsed.
He later died in the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We sent a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in a larger city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This is heartbreaking," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities are afraid that the number of fatalities will increase to thousands, while the country's emergency relief agency says access to the small towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of dead increases while we find bodies trapped under buildings. Many of them we can't reach," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six metres have destroyed Palu, which is to hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Emergency aid comes in with military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute comes an ambulance with multiple bodies.
It is difficult to find clean water.
Small shops have been robbed."
Jan Gelfand, the leader of the Red Cross, Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find when they arrive.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo came to Palu on Sunday and said to the military In the country: "I ask you all to work around the clock to do everything they can to help with the evacuation.
Are they ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, killing 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now reports man missing after lagoon plane crash
The airline operating an aircraft that crashed in a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific Ocean reports that a man has been slowed down, having stated earlier that all 47 of the passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the aircraft before it sank.
Air Niugini stated that as of Saturday afternoon they do not know where the male passenger is.
The airline said they are working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not provide any more details about the passenger, and his age and nationality are unknown.
Local boat owners helped save other passengers and the crew after the aircraft drained the water when it attempted to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Authorities stated on Friday that seven people have been sent to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, and all were in stable condition.
It is still unknown what caused the crash and what actually happened.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses believed the plane was flying past the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
“It was very good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes added that he and other passengers were able to water through the water, which reached them up to life, to the nocturnal passages on the plane before it sank.
He said the flight crew panicked and screamed, and he suffered a head injury that was not serious.
The U.S. Navy said that nearby sailors, working to improve a dock, also rescued passengers with a rubber boat which they used to carry passengers to shore before the plane sank at about 30 metres.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network website shows that 111 people have died in crashes of PNG-registered airlines' aircraft over the past 20 years, but none of them flew with Air Niugini.
Analysts make timeline overnight as woman got burned alive
The prosecution presented all evidence on Saturday during the alleged trial for a man charged with burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He presented to the jury how he puzzled footage from cell phones to find out what happened the night Jessica Chambers (19) was killed by the defendant, Quinton Tellis (29).
According to The Clarion Ledger newspaper, Rowlett told us that he used location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, as opposed to what Tellis explained earlier.
When the location data showed Tellis' cell phone was with Chambers' cell phone at the same time as he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police left to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he was out of town that day.
When the prosecution asked Tellis if he told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he was "laughing, because my car was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
But their cell phone bills showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers died, Tellis deleted messages, calls, and Chambers' contact information from his mobile phone.
"He deleted her from her life," Hale said.
The defense will end the case on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Avla What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio will challenge the music genre's negative reputation by filling their music with positive thoughts.
The High Breed of Bristol, England, says that hip hop has moved away from the original political idea of tackling problems in society.
They will return to hip hop's roots and make the conscious version of the genre popular again.
The Fugees of Common have become more popular again in the UK through the artists Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York child sitter sues couple for fired after "racist" text message
A New York child sitter sues a couple to give her fired based on discrimination after she received a false-sent text message from her mother complaining that she was "even a black person."
The couple has denied being racist, comparing the lawsuit to "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, was unhappy when she saw that the babysitter she had hired, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work for the first time in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEI, ENDA ONE BLACK PERSON," Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending her husband's message, she sent him to the babysitter Maurice, twice.
After realizing her mistake, the inappropriate Plasco-Flaxman fired babysitter Maurice, saying that the previous babysitter, who was African-American, had done a bad job, so now she wanted someone from the Philippines, according to The New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day's work before sending her home in an Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for having fired her. She wants $350 per day for six months for the job she should have had, even if it was without a contract, where she would live with her family.
"I want to show them that it's not okay to do so," she told The New York Post on Friday, adding, "I know there's discrimination."
The couple have denied that they are racists, saying that giving Maurice fired was the only thing they could do after insulting her, because they were afraid she would take revenge.
"My wife had sent something to her that she didn't mean to say.
She is not a racist.
We are not racists," her husband Joel Plasco told The New York Post.
"But would you let someone you've insulted take care of your children, even if you didn't mean to insult them?
Your newborn baby?
Think about it.”
Plasco compared the lawsuit to "extortion," saying his wife was seven months pregnant and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you really going to attack a person in such a situation?
It's not a nice thing to do," said investor Plasco.
As the case progresses, the public has been quick to judge the couple on social media, criticizing them for their performance and logic.
The publisher behind the Paddington books was afraid that people would not like a talking bear, reveals new letter
The daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the approval of the first book, commented: "It is difficult to imagine what it was like to read the book for the first time, before it was published.
It's very fun to know now how successful Paddington became."
Jankel said that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about the little teddy bear, would be optimistic even if the book had been rejected. She added that she had mixed feelings during her book's 60th anniversary, because her father died last year.
As for Paddington, whom she described as "a very important member of the family," she added that her father was proud of the inside of how successful he was.
"He was a pretty quiet man, and he never laughed," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having children who achieved something: you become proud of them even though it's not really you who's behind it.
I think he looked at Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always gave all praise to Paddington himself."
My daughter was going to die and I had to say goodbye on the phone
When she landed, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice in haste, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say it was really bad, that they didn't think she was going to make it," said Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, dear you.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm coming soon.
The medical doctors had given her for her heart to continue pumping was slowly en route out of her system.
She had already died and now her body was about to shut down.
I was just sitting there, knowing this was happening.
I couldn't feel or scream, because I was in a room surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep everything inside."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, had to board the plane along with other passengers who did not know what she had just gone through.
"No one knew anything," she said.
"I sat with my head bent while tears fell."
It's hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I knew how much sympathy I had for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Sorrowing women hang patches on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who lost their loved ones who committed suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have attached patches on a bridge in Wales to inspire and make people think they're going to commit suicide to change their minds and call the numbers on the patches.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to struggle with depression and took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel the way I know myself every day."
Davis, aged 45 and living in Lydney, said her son was a talented cook with a smile that infected.
"Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They said his smile lit up all the rooms."
But before his death, he left for work, for he was in a "really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother was the first to find Tyler after taking his own life.
Davis said, "I'm still worried that his little brother may have been affected by Tyler's death."
Davis wrote the notes "for people to know that there are other people out there who care and that they can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don’t sit there alone – you have to talk to someone.”
Humphreys, who has been Davis' friend for many years, lost her partner Mark after they had been together for 15 years and he had recently lost his mother.
"He never told me he was sad or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he began to behave differently.
He was in the basement emotionally on Christmas Day, when the kids opened their gifts he didn't even look at them."
She told him that his death was very traumatic for the children, and they continued to work through the trauma: "There is a big void in our family now.
We are completely destroyed.
But we all have to fight to live on."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread while the FBI starts the investigation
"I thought that if we actually got something similar to what he's asking for -- a limited investigation -- then maybe we could achieve some loneliness," said Flake on Saturday, adding that he's afraid the committee "fell together" in the middle of a partisan backlock.
Why would Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
They hesitate because of the timing.
The U.S. midterm elections are just five weeks away, on November 6, and if Republicans don't do well, this will make it difficult for them to choose Kavanaugh in the U.S. Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has called senators to have them support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and was introduced to his wife Ashley that way, then has been Bush's secretary.
What happens when the FBI presents its report?
They are going to vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh is able to collect at least 50 votes in the Senate. With 50 votes, Mike Pense, the vice president of the United States, can give him the last vote and confirm him in the Supreme Court.
North Korea’s number of defectors ‘descends’ under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator reports
Park Byeong-seug referred to data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, saying there were 1127 defectors last year – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park said that stricter borders between North Korea and China and more expensive smuggling charges are the main reasons why the number has declined.
Pyongyang has not spoken publicly.
The vast majority of defectors from North Korea are granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean countries.
China views defectors as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, and often sends them back with coercion.
Relations between North and South Korea – which are technically still at war – have improved in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to negotiate the disarmament of nuclear weapons.
These talks come after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of not achieving anything since then.
"Without being able to rely on the United States, we cannot rely on our country to be safe, and in such a situation, we cannot disarm our weapons first," Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," saying he can't serve in the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court, "hysterically" and said he has too much temperament to serve in the U.S. Supreme Court.
Pelosi called Kavanaugh "hysterical" in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I know that if a woman had behaved that way, she had been called "hysterical," Pelosi said of Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate Court on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotional and denied any charges that he sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In Kavanaugh's opening speech, he was very emotional and at times yelled with lumps in his throat while telling about his family and the years of further education.
He criticized the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him "grotesque and a planned assassination of his reputation," organized by liberal police officers who were angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi added that she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he cannot serve in the Supreme Court, because it shows that he is biased against Democrats.
"I think the way he behaved disqualifies him, and what he said about the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi made an objection when she was asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh to resign if he is elected to the Supreme Court, and if the Democrats achieve a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I can say this – if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he can't serve in the Supreme Court, nor in the court he serves now," Pelosi added.
Kavanaugh is a judge in Washington, D.C.'s Federal Court of Appeals.
Pelosi also said that as a Democrat, she is concerned about potential Kavanaugh judges against the law known as Obamacare and the Roe vs. Wade case, because Kavanaugh is known to be a conservative judge.
In the hearings to confirm Kavanaugh, he avoided answering questions as to whether he would reverse certain decisions in the Supreme Court.
"It's not the right time for a hysterical, prejudiced person in the Supreme Court who expects us to say he's great," Pelosi said.
And women must wield the sword
It's a fair, bitter criticism, after months and years of rage, and she doesn't get it out without crying.
"We cried when we're angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you think?"
She continues, "I got a lot of help from a woman in a high firm position, who said that she branched when she was angry, but developed a technique where she said to the person who made her so angry that she branched, "You think maybe I'm sorry because I was crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just continues.
I thought it was brilliant.
Tears serve as a way to get the mind out, but there are many who misunderstand.
In one of my strongest memories of a previous job, where most of my colleagues were men, I was in a situation where I branched out of anger, and a woman who was older than me took me by the neck – she was a cold leader for whom I had always been terrified – and pulled me out in the hallway.
"Never let them see you crying," she said to me.
"They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sorry and that they won because they made you cry."
Patricia Schroeder, who was at the time a congresswoman, a Colorado Democrat, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, Hart was caught cheating on a boat called Monkey Business, and withdrew from the campaign. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought she could as well run for president herself.
"I hadn't actually thought through it well enough," she said to me while laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates running for office, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign had already taken place for a while, she had not raised enough money, so she promised that she would only run if she was able to raise $2 million.
It was impossible.
She discovered that her supporters who gave $1000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she asked.
When she declared that she would not run for office anyway, she was so emotional and full of gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and aim at the voters instead of the delegates, and anger at the gender discrimination, that she began to cry during the speech.
"You would think I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder said of how the press reacted when she branched.
"You would think Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to write on my tombstone?
"What branch?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The opening saloons of the trade war between the United States and China were island-ready, and while the battle continued, a rift between the two countries may be an advantage to Beijing for the long term, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump is shooting first shot this year to tax key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The battle escalated this week, with tariffs on articles worth over $200 billion, which in effect means that half of all goods from China to the United States are taxed.
Beijing has taken back and set tariffs of between five and ten percent on U.S. goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to answer the United States for every shot they fire off, and the second largest economy in the world is most likely not going to go down with the first.
To make Washington quit, China must do what the United States wants, but bowing to the United States is too embarrassed for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Yet, experts say that if Beijing keeps its head cold, the U.S. pressure may have a positive effect on the Chinese economy in the long run, by reducing the degree of dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can cause both economies to go down is more dangerous than people have dared to admit before," said Abigail Grace, a researcher focusing on Asia at the Center for American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says they are ready to accept refugees who will return voluntarily, asking for help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed after more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are making progress.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to regain normal areas.
All provisions are now in place for refugees to be able to return voluntarily to the country in which they had to travel due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that went beyond their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
An additional six million people in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government would be happy to accept help to rebuild the ruined country.
However, he stressed that they will not accept assistance or assistance with terms from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe secures victory in Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup when they defeated the American team with a final score of 16.5 versus 10.5 in Le Golf National outside of Paris, France.
The United States has now lost on European soil six times in a row, and they have not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took back the crown in that team of the Danish captain, Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, reached the 14.5 points they needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson struggled most of the tournament, beating the ball in the water from the tee at hole 16, par 3, and giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari did well in all of his rounds and became one of four players ever to receive 5-0-0 since the tournament started its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5&4 by the player with the lowest ranking on the European team, Danish Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, with the world's highest rank, became 2 and 1 after English Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who has participated in eight Ryder Cups, became the most winning European with 25.5 points in his career.
"Usually I didn't cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
Thank you so much for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so, so glad to get the trophy back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the relay stick to fellow countryman John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in Sunday's single game.
"I feel a tremendous pride in beating Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at him," said Rahm (23).
Woods lost all four of his games in France, and now has a 13-21-3 I Ryder Cup merit list up through his career.
A remarkable statistic from one of the world's best players, which has won 14 major titles and is only beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled to find the fairway all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who impressed with high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Jim Furyk, the American captain, stated after a disappointing showing from his team. "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There were periods this morning where we made it hot for Europe.
- Me fought.
Hats off to Thomas.
He is a single captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the PGA in America and our committee for the Ryder Cup and get on with it.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be captain.
You have to take off your hat.
We were played round."
