DFB chief Grindel sees no basis for <0xC3><0x96>zil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel does not currently see a basis for a return of Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil to the national team.
“That’s a question that obviously depends on you getting in touch with him once, that you’re also talking to him about why he apparently felt something like that in his statement,” Grindel said in the football podcast “Phrasesm<0xC3><0xA4>her” of the “Bild-Zeitung.”
Despite the months-long debate over the photos of <0xC3><0x96>zil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of the 92-time national player <0xC3><0x96>zil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed up to some point that this would be the case,” Grindel said.
The 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and also justified it by the fact that Grindel did not defend him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The DFB chief reiterated his criticism of <0xC3><0x96>zil that he was not ready for a conversation with federal coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn’t want to build pressure, but he knows it from football so that if “you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I’m sorry that this conversation hasn’t come about yet”.
Linz: Garden hut in Schrebergartensiedlung burned
At 2:13 p.m. the professional fire brigade Linz was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly over the Schrebergarten settlement, danger was in delay.
The professional fire brigade moved out and found the hut in Vollbrand when they arrived.
The roof had to be removed practically to its full extent and fires were removed to the extent strictly necessary.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had a battery plugged into the store at noon.
This could be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to the fire department, the charger was in the area of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire has yet to be determined – as well as the cause of the fire.
However, it should be considerable, because the owner had many collectibles in his garden hut.
Angry mother defends herself: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on open road
What drove Lindsay Lohan to this very strange action?
She apparently wanted to take the children away from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has streamed live as she apparently wants to snatch the children from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the U.S. portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial recording of the stream.
Here you can see "Kissed to Happiness" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows Lohan getting out of a car and going to a possibly homeless family she wants to have as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family escapes in front of the actress, Lohan pursues the parents and their children.
It accuses adults of child trafficking.
For all that, she does not provide any evidence in the clip.
"The whole world is seeing this right now," Lohan can be heard in the video as she continues to follow the family along the road.
Apparently, she tries to separate the children from her parents.
At some point, however, the apparently angry mother seems to be enough.
It looks like she's turning around and Lohan is missing an eardrum.
With tears, the actress insists on how shocked she is – and she keeps her cheek.
What has moved Lohan to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "mascot" on the asteroid
The probe "Hayabusa2" started in Japan in December 2014.
It should approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can absorb material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The lander "Mascot" will stay on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: number of dead on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of magnitude 7.5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, there are at least 420 fatalities.
The number of victims could increase even further.
The rescue teams have not yet penetrated into the devastated areas cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla CEO
In the beginning there was a tweet.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused unrest in the stock markets at the beginning of August when he announced a withdrawal of the electric car maker.
The U.S. stock market supervisor sued him for fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk must pay, and the Tesla boss withdraws from the Supervisory Board, but he is allowed to remain Chairman of the Board.
British Conservative Party Congress
Sharply guarded - the Tories Party Congress
Birmingham will be the stage of a power struggle.
At the party congress, it is supposed to be about foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and Brexit hardliners, on the front line of former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new state name
Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these name doublings for years.
Now they have agreed.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in the future and the population will vote on it this Sunday - whether or not it's okay?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The Not") - meant Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands went to the streets in several cities to protest right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The “Trump of Brazil” is an anti-system candidate and is therefore at the forefront of the polls.
His strongest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers’ Party.
Audi: Dieselgate reprocessing takes longer than planned
“The diesel task force still exists,” said Peter Mertens, Chief Development Officer, in a press release.
Detained and retired Audi chief Rupert Stadler announced in December 2017 that the task force would soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/gear combinations are expected to be tested," he said at the time.
Mertens said: "In early July, we have reached an important stage goal in the work-up of the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The task force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at the Audi mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the automaker had made "gravating organizational changes" so that such a scandal would never occur again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler’s future on Friday and will continue to discuss this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi chief of having authorised the sale of diesel cars with incorrect emission values after the exhaust gas confiscations have become known.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Currently, Bram Schot is managing the company as Chief Executive Officer.
Due to the change to the new exhaust gas and fuel consumption test standard WLTP, there are production failures at Audi, Schot said the "Heilbronn Voice".
In principle, he sees a falling demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
“The segment itself is difficult,” he said.
Schot relies on electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, 15,000 reservations have already been made.
Grindel seeks re-election - Lahm to join the DFB presidency
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants to run again for office as DFB President, despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the <0xC3><0x96>zil affair next year.
"I'm doing my job and trying to make them as good as possible," Grindel said as a guest early Sunday morning at the ZDF's "Current Sports Studio".
You have to try again and again to re-elect, I will.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
According to his own words, the head of the association found it "strange" if he did not "just work on the future project" after the bid for the European Football Championship 2024.
Since April 2016, Grindel has been head of the association as the successor of Wolfgang Niersbach, who fell over the summer fairy tale affair.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will be held at the DFB-Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, future EM chief organizer Philipp Lahm will be working in the DFB Bureau.
"I would be happy if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that he would also be involved in this role in the Bureau in the future and would be invited, of course, to provide his experience on sporting issues," Grindel said.
He did not want to participate in speculation as to whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB chief.
As a consequence of the affair surrounding the photos of Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in future a national player without a migration background should become an integration ambassador of the DFB.
Currently, this office is run by native Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter having family roots in Cameroon.
“If someone without a migration background has a clear impact on society and football and says, ‘the issue is important, we need to take care of that’, that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs where integration must work,” Grindel said.
Lose weight correctly with a semi-smart scale
I've had a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that not only measures my weight, but also the body fat percentage.
It can also indicate muscle and bone mass.
The body-mass index calculates the thing as well, but it’s more for the sausage.
He doesn’t say if I’ve replaced fat with muscle.
Basketball-Bundesliga: Clear record sequence for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started with a clear victory in the new season of the Basketball Bundesliga.
Against Science City Jena, the vice-champion easily won 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing game over 40 minutes.
Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer of the dominant Berliners with 20 points.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 numerator) from Ludwigsburg also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators during his mandatory game debut.
Former champion Brose Bamberg won the mandatory game debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best thrower at the guests with 24 points.
Würzburg professional Gabriel Olaseni came on 14 counts.
Last year’s playoff semi-finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt at 83:76 (41:34).
New national player Karim Jallow was the most accurate shooter on the team of coach John Patrick with 24 points.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a significant success.
The basketball lions Braunschweig had a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new game maker Will Cummings outperformed the Oldenburgers with 25 points.
The Braunschweigers, where NBA star Dennis Schröder has been the majority owner since the start of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the basketballs quickly provided clear conditions.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an urged the German government to extradite supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens, no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm German-Turkish friendship,” he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, the city centre of Cologne was partially closed.
Several thousand policemen were in service - among them also snipers.
The Islamic Association of Ditib is in criticism because it is considered an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against Poverty: Stars, Buhrufe und Frighteousness
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have promoted greater engagement in the fight against poverty and disease at a concert in New York’s Central Park.
"Engage wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival on the night of Sunday in front of around 60,000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, this is a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with fringes and golden microphone.
I’m nervous, I sweat, but it’s okay, because I’m here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organizations, also appeared on stage at the multi-hour spectacle.
In between, however, there was a second of terror when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal barrier was for shots, got scared and tried to escape.
There was panic, and people ran into each other.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said organiser Hugh Evans.
The New York police and musician Chris Martin calmed the people from the stage.
“No one is trying to hurt anyone,” Martin said.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available for free on the Internet, like every year.
Anyone who wanted to find one had to read and spread texts, photos and videos on the internet about the global fight against poverty and disease.
For the numerous musicians and actors, there were cheers and applause from the audience – but for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
He spoke together with his democratic colleague Chris Coons on the stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had spoken out on the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court and thus pushed many women in front of their heads.
At least three women have raised abuse allegations up to the attempted rape of Kavanaugh, which he rejects.
Flake called for an FBI investigation into the allegations after two women, who claimed to have experienced sexual assaults themselves, confronted him on the way to a committee meeting in an elevator.
“You can also come along with me at any time in an elevator,” Flake told the crowd at the concert in New York.
Freedom of the press: Federal government defends the journalist's outburst
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert defended the expulsion of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an.
At the chancellor's office, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had a t-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone to the first row.
The T-shirt, had not been the problem, Seibert said of the picture on Sunday.
It was a disruption of the press conference.
As a result of the journalist’s action, a strong unrest has arisen, which is unacceptable.
This is why he ordered people to take the man out.
Seibert said that it is not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies completely regardless of whether it is a legitimate request or not.
The rules are the rules.
There are many journalists in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage or support or membership in prohibited parties or the Fethullah Gulen movement.
The Turkish leadership blamed the movement for the failed coup attempt on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists have been in prison for several decades.
Foreign journalists are also not safe from the Turkish authorities: Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested at the beginning of September.
Recently, the cases of the detained journalists Me<0xC5><0x9F>ale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had caused a stir.
Although they were free and were able to return to Germany, there are still processes against the two in Turkey.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him as fresh and good-looking: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look at it twice: Yes, that’s really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht" produced by the NDR is known for a warm conversation at the counter of the Hamburg harbour pub "Schellfischposten".
Moderator Ina Müller, with her guests, encounters some beer, some wine or even more high-percentage drinks to relax the mood and tongues.
Not a few celebrities also drink courage for the obligatory singing sessions.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time around: The actor Florian David Fitz known from films such as "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Horniest Day".
The Münchner got the trip to the high north but not at all good.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely scratched on it, his eyes only two small slits.
The bed-selfie shows a completely laid-out Florian David Fitz.
But he is not sick, he only has a powerful hangover.
Addressed to his fans, he posted some - probably not very serious - findings, which he has now gained: "Rules one: never go to Ina's night.
Rule two: never drink the black sauce.
And splash.
And the round of egg liqueur, which Ina throws at half past three, also leave.
Alcohol consumption is truly written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans posted a few tips for fighting the aftermath.
They ranged from instant broth, fish sandwiches or - probably the most targeted - headache tablets.
Others were simply amused by the sight of the normally attractive movie star.
How Ina Müller survived the nocturnal soufflage is not yet known.
However, since she has been moderating TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more experienced.
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa is struggling with vandalism and unrest
The entrance to the 36-kilometer long railway cycle path in the Red Riding Hood country in Treysa is difficult to find and waste.
Recipes against the rampant vandalism are sought, but solutions are hardly distinguishable.
Scarves, cigarette tipping, garbage and debris, demolished trash cans and now dismantled signposts - this is how the entrance to the bike path on the Haa<0xC3><0x9F>e hill in Treysa has been presented for a long time.
For the show object Bahnradweg in Rotk<0xC3><0xA4>ppchenland a more than infamous sight.
The topic concerns members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also others for a long time, according to the cycling commissioner of the city of Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been addressed in the Council on Cycling.
There is no solution so far.
The proposals ranged from the laying of the seating group to the regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the surfaces at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the commandment of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic has also been included in the local advisory board.
Not only does the garbage drive cyclists and residents around - the seating area is a regular meeting place for celebrations on weekends.
Not only is it often noisy, the layers are also destroyed: posts torn from the ground, trash cans demolished, signs bent around, seating furniture smeared.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more frequently, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
The actions, however, are only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
They are annoyed that the resting place on the bike path in Treysa is a meeting point for suction racks.
"The focus here is clearly on the Haa<0xC3><0x9F>e hill along the entire cycle path," confirms the cycling traffic commissioner, who is now also concerned about the new bike site in Ziegenhain, which will be opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive".
Another idea is a video surveillance on the hill: "Perhaps this sets the threshold significantly higher to get involved in Gemeingut.
However, this would require a police raid to be completed in a timely manner.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wants a development of the Haa<0xC3><0x9F>e hill.
It needs to be made more attractive.
With the frequency of the cycle path so far one can be very satisfied.
Tourism marketing is still expandable.
Our bike path is very high-quality compared to others in Germany," said the ADFC members.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert estimates the situation on Ascheröder Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e in Treysa as an extremely critical hazard.
There is no turning track on the Haa<0xC3><0x9F>e hill.
In the event of heavy traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between the two sides of the traffic flow," she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but probably for the elderly and especially for children.
Music contest in the cultural railway station: the "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in cooperation.
"D to present a song for Hiltrup", is the appeal of the Hiltrup district offensive, in the "Music contest for big and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with eye shadows in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family reunion with coffee and cake from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-lived Hiltrup-living albachtener, the nine of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the Kindergarten and the Lunkamp family.
This contest, District Mayor Joachim Schmidt said, was a novelty.
We haven’t seen this in other parts of the city yet.
What were the lyrics associated with?
In the villages the Hiltruper lake and the Marktallee were mentioned particularly frequently.
Rolf Ihmig named the avenue "Kö von Hiltrup" in his schlager-like song.
The cultural railway station was also appreciated.
Time and again it was about experiencing each other in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short reconstruction breaks with short interviews with the interpreters or hints about her work.
Humberg learned that he actually studied chemistry, but now also teaches guitar.
From the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann, Franke knew to report that he recently performed in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has meanwhile placed everything on Youtube.
“It’s not about winning,” Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from Hiltruper Gastronomy.
There was still something special for the jury’s favorites – so that others can hear their songs.
A whole CD can be recorded by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Himig with his Hiltrup-Schlager, who particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like all of them, the children appeared again to the finals – and even sounded “right well” without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, ingenuity of the melody and recognition value.
The jury belonged to Gisbert Keller of the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfa<0xC3><0x9F> of the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers of the Wirtschaftsverbund, as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year existence.
She regarded the event as a complete success.
All were "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural railway station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
For each side there is a screen, in it four cards with keywords, which can only be deciphered - the old trick with the red foil - once you put them in.
This ensures that the opposite side cannot read anything by mistake.
On the maps, for example, you can read from left to right: "1st Renaissance.
2. Window.
3. dice.
4th Party".
These are the terms that need to be encrypted from now on.
Because we should not guess the terms here, but codes.
Alternately one player per team is the cipher.
He gets a code card that might have "3.4.2".
In "Decrypto" should be guessed not the terms behind the secret foil, but its encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe, in this order and in this example, the terms "throw", "fast" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team as far as possible does not; because this is the game if he succeeds twice in cracking the code.
So the cipher notes and reads aloud: "Throw" for the dice, "Lose" as opposed to Fest; here, of course, something like "Party" would be possible and "Prague" because he took care of the school and knew the window fall there.
This is how round for round, team for team goes on.
You do not know the terms of the opposite side - but it can be better combined with any hint that the cipher gives there.
Possibly mysterious, but not too turned off, the rewrites should be so, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic of "Decrypto" is the rulebook.
The players probably have to study it for quite a long time and in detail until they can finally play.
The explanation video at decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But anyone who has first started will be fascinated by how much feeling is in this inconspicuous game.
Overall, however, "decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as its predecessor and genre-primium "codenames", which also adds an agent theme to a game with fewer words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And if you’re only interested in guessing and not winning points, you can easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler greeting and harasses guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspectorate Kulmbach twice the night from Saturday to Sunday.
He first showed the Hitler greeting in the Upper City of a police strip passing by, later he also appeared in the Upper City in a pub when he harassed other guests.
After he clearly alcoholized did not comply with the given police referral, he had to spend the night at the police inspection Kulmbach in the Haftzelle.
In the sober state, he must then also be held criminally responsible for the use of marks of unconstitutional organizations.
Pressig was the home of the thrust locomotives
The railway plant in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers were banging on buffers, it was heard in a very pressy way," recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
That didn't upset anyone.
The brakes also squeaked and the wagons rattled.
It was pure railway.
Statements that are symbolic of Dinkel's home Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so shaped by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep ramp mountain route to the north, which, after an increase of about 220 metres, has its centre in Steinbach am Wald.
To cope with this, train and push locomotives were used in the past, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 locomotive sheds, apprentice workshop, driving management and railway mastery.
"The heartpiece was the turntable that had a diameter of 18 meters after a conversion in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and 47-year-old professional railroader.
Loks were also operated by the Bahnbetriebswerk (BW) Pressig, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, for the secondary lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On 15 July 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight Elloks were stationed in Pressig at the time.
The electrification of the 1939 route already minimized the need for train and thrust locomotives.
From 1977 they were only used for freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10,000 weighings were still ranked per month.
In 1982, parts of the factory were demolished, and in 1991 the rest were demolished.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that you have not noticed a better use of the site, even in terms of freight transport".
Even at Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated a pompous railway station festival in Pressig for the anniversary of "50 Years of Electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld".
“There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here,” recalls Georg Dinkel.
A little later, it's off.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Rangierbahnhof Pressig was history.
"The shunters and backshoes did the most difficult work in train traffic," Dinkel recalls.
Any mistake would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station Pressig-Rothenkirchen has led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current pictures can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round of the Beijing Tennis Tournament, just as Julia Görges had before.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against Frenchwoman Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent in the world rankings is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or the Spanishwoman Carla Su<0xC3><0xA1>rez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina when the Russin set at number 13 gave up.
The Swabian now gets to do with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
As part of the series "Kunst und Genuss" a special exhibition was opened at the weekend in Mittelehrenbach.
Organisers and visitors registered with great ease looked at the ideal weather when the special vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the open space of the Dahlmann- Schmidt estate, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the roof of the tourism association "Rund ums Walberla" as part of the series "Kunst und Genuss".
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
A large visitor’s welcome showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the Vernissage.
He himself has been there since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist alike.
A bit surprising, but Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
However, with Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, he placed his task in tried and tested, young hands with a good future perspective.
Both have already actively contributed to the selection of artists in the past and have helped design flyers.
This year again, on the occasion of Art & Pleasure, there will be a 70-cent special letter brand, designed by them, available at any art station.
This year's poster "Betzn uttanzen", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased there for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high acceptance of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won for the musical framing.
As the walk through the spacious garden quickly becomes clear to the visitor that the title "Windspiel-Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it playfully.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramics, often with colored accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, the visitor awaits on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, brightened in color, playfully equipped with 20 windwheels, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminum tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun flashing through the bushwork in the background, the object looks magically sunk and invites you to linger.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who prefers to dedicate himself in three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts, in the wind moving.

50 Years of MGV 68 Albachten: Singers Celebrate 50th Birthday Festively
1968 - this was the time of protest and the student movement.
And the Albachteners also aired their displeasure at that time.
At least five of them.
They did not want to agree with the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir "C<0xC3><0xA4>cilia" there should no longer be singing life in the district.
It has now become a legend: at a bank in Tinnenbusch they raised the MGV 68 Albachten from baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "House of Meeting".
"It's getting full today," said Chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachten singers.
Especially for the anniversary, they had revived the Foundation Festival.
For years it was tradition, then there was a break.
On time for the 50th anniversary, the traditional festival was back.
An elegant ball was made to order festive clothes had been requested before.
The guests did not sit as usual in the "House of Meeting" in rows of seats, but comfortable at tables.
In between, movement was announced: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln drew on the controls and asked for the dance floor.
The singers of the MGV 68 Albachten made their own voice sound.
In line with the occasion, happy songs were announced.
It’s like, “A day as beautiful as it is today.”
Suitable for the exquisite grape juice that many people had in front of them, there was the "Ruedesheimer Wein".
In reference to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus" sounded, which is the Latin term for "hope".
Again sovereign was the choir lead by Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were at the time in Tinnenbusch.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," said Holstiege, "he has such an easy way, it's a masterpiece he performs." By the way, this time it wasn't just men singing.
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire mainly includes Evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
Finally, there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber sat at the desk until three in the morning to create his own rhyme.
Andreas Winterhoff also presented well-sounding poetry.
There was also a large tombola.
The proceeds will be used to finance a visit to the Allwetterzoo for the children of the Albatros Youth Centre.

Volleyball: 3rd League Women: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The climber is marching.
Three games, three wins - the reserve of the USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring is really well placed in League three.
No trace of shyness or fracking, the independents do their thing.
And that’s really good for 3-0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aasee.
“That wasn’t crystal clear, but we’ve already left an impression,” says the somewhat satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not dissatisfied." On the contrary.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday party of Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game was cut off.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical illusion.
In the third set, the guests had a set ball.
“If they bring it to the finish line, a game like this can tip,” Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, the USC, with its routine forces, made everything clear and brought the full yield to the goal.
“We all know who is on the other side of a derby.
That doesn't break our neck.
I have seen really good volleyball in phases," Annacker did not hate the 0:3 - and immediately went over to the agenda.
Where the journey goes for the independents, it seems not foreseeable after just three days of play.
“It’s just too early for that,” says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The 3rd league has an incredibly good level.
This is not nearly comparable to Regionalliga-Volleyball". In the fourth league they do not want to look down anyway.
If the vest is not soiled in the next few weeks, they need to look up.
However, a first balance sheet can only be drawn after ten, eleven games.
On Saturday we go to Emlichheim.
Aasee will take place in Essen on 14 October.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "dreamship" Heide Keller became a star.
Now she openly talks about the series having a co-debt on her marriage out with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "dreamship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018, she left for good.
The series, which made her star, could be co-responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
“That could have been a reason, too.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled around the world with a suitcase alone, and many of my admirers took me to eye level," Keller told Bild am Sonntag.
At first, she was always "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "dream ship".
Because now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"Whether he liked it so well, I don't know."
She considers it possible that her then-husband might have been quite jealous, but "how many men also spared Hans talks about problems and feelings".
Keller has always tried to be the only one for Hans von Borsody "and he didn't want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I was surprised," she continues.
She always felt like “not being good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman that I never really was, even though I sometimes seemed cheeky and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever.”
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas H<0xC3><0xA4>rtner, Keller said yes again, “although I was afraid that it could also go wrong a second time.”
The day before the public wedding I was sitting crying in the cloakroom and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why has it never worked with men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had the love at the time "as imagined in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not everyday.
I’ve been too naive about love.”
The Nightmare, which regularly explores the city’s nightlife at the NZZ-Resort Zurich, has ventured to the ZFF opening party this time.
Our moth is not a moth, but a little shy.
And the sheer luster in which a green carpet is dipped in the hexagonal lobe blinds it over a fee.
But it’s a film festival, as more or less famous people want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
On this late Thursday evening, he wanders over the square to make himself a little easier in the "Aquaclean-WC-Oase".
This is what the public toilet system, sponsored by a large sanitary company, is called, which will premiere at the festival: The need center in the parterre of a new pavilion is a lot of work to flow a luxurious ambience.
That night, however, it stinks in the men's oasis for some reason to the sky.
So get out here, over to the other side of the street: Invited guests, who have just had a good time in the cinema next to the opening film "Green Book", celebrate the beginning of the festival with a party in the three-storey department store every year.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: as you know, the works shown are from all over the world.
What you don’t have to do with an article about this festival in order not to fall into sneak advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The moth binds a little belt around the feelers, which has put a good fairy in it, and two bully doorstands actually wink him in generously.
Inside the crowd, they dance well after midnight to live music or let DJs pretend rhythms, to which they yell at each other, and rinse down with Cüpli exquisite chops.
In the delicatessen shop in the Souterrain, oysters are waiting for simmering mouths, next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, a chocolate fountain is sprouted.
And the hammer is: all the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without heavy losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The butterfly studies the sign at the escalator: "Take a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If these are two separate instructions, he has hidden himself in the dress code.
But it is more of a conditional construction, and it has certainly already saved lives.
In the household goods section on the upper floor, the poultry tipped a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", matching the festival award.
The price for the best drink does not necessarily get this mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself.
And George Clooney, who has been promoting this brand for years, is not here that evening either.
However, between local celebrity, cash desk and kitchen items, there is a face that is familiar to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His main character may not be far away.
And really: Viggo Mortensen walks through the crowd, with almost sixty almost acting like a choral boy.
He's not being bullied, he's not getting caught, he's not being stolen at all.
Especially for this reluctance, like misinterpreted as entanglement, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with cumbia dances
Coach and ex-football star Diego Maradona is delighted with his team’s victory.
Argentina’s football legend Diego Maradona seems to have lived well in his new home Mexico.
After a 2-0 victory of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to Cumbia rhythms, as seen in a video released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in a yellow jersey, cheered by the players.
The Mexican second-ligist defeated the Leones Negros by 2-0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona called in a TV camera "Always with my boys, always".
The 57-year-old has been training the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Send to Last-Minute-Pledge "destroyed on the ground"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball league player ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defeat". His protégés were "destroyed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - Pleite - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
As in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst, they had not played badly over long periods of time, the senders.
Only the initial phase "we slept completely", the ASV coach was annoyed.
The landlords quickly led with 8:1, even the early time off, which Bieletzki had taken, did not initially fruit.
"But then suddenly a ruck went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter-hour.
For the break, the gap was only two goals.
Especially Senden’s best, Marius Hintze, met at the stage a different time.
After the change, it got even better from a visitor’s point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst finished at 15:15, followed by the season changer almost continuously.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still apparently calming three hits (29:26).
And then what?
Take the impartial into action.
Bieletzki is usually careful not to seek the guilt of others.
But: The 120-second time penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff cashed was "a joke".
LIT had a good laugh and hit four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, they stood well against seven men in the back and threw them to the empty gate again and again.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now you have to have a damn victory," said the restlessly served Bieletzki.
ASV-Tore: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).
Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - police dig for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of a then 18-year-old from Naila, the police are looking for the remains of the woman.
On Saturday at Marxgrün, emergency forces dug up a road.
For this purpose, the road surface and several layers were removed, as police and prosecutors shared.
According to new findings, the missing person may not have been buried far from their former residence.
The woman has disappeared since November 4, 1986.
The investigators did not rule out a crime at the time.
Since last year, the Kriminalpolizei Hof, together with the prosecutor’s office, has been working intensively on the case again.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monument Protection Authority, the investigators encountered a conspicuous under the street near Marxgrün by means of a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials limited the site to a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows which threats are lurking on the web.

In addition, security updates, such as for Windows, should be installed quickly, nor does it harm to equip computers with anti-virus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his imminent dismissal as head of the multi-billion dollar company.
He and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) extrajudicially filed a lawsuit over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla each pay $20 million, and Musk resigns for three years as Chairman, a position comparable to that of the German Supervisory Board chief.
The Chief Executive Officer can stay against it.
In the comparison, which neither a court has to confirm, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted wrongdoing.
The SEC had sued the world-renowned manager in Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also heads SpaceX, is the public face of the loss writing electric car pioneer, who is now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock exchange.
Musk is not aware of any guilt.
Musk explained that he did nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed about the lawsuit.
He has always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company off the stock exchange and pay $420 per share that the funding was secured.
Tesla would have been valued at $72 billion.
Musk later rowed back: Tesla remains on the stock market.
After the agreement, Tesla must now find an outside chairman, hire two independent board members, and set up a committee that monitors Musk’s communications.
Football: Sturridge rescues Liverpool: Klopp team 1:1 at Chelsea FC
Liverpool came to a 1-1 draw at Chelsea.
In the top match at FC Chelsea, the attacker who had just been replaced by coach Jürgen Klopp in the 89th minute made the 1:1 (0:1).
After six wins at the start, Liverpool fell back to second place.
Chelsea remain third, new leader is Manchester City.
Eden Hazard took the lead in the 25th minute with his sixth season hit.
After that, the Klopp team missed the compensation several times.
National player Antonio Rüdiger clarified after a solo by Liverpool goalkeeper Mohamed Salah on the line (31st).
Shortly before the end, Sturridge released the Reds with a slinker in the corner.
Manchester United's record-breaking start to the season has plunged ever deeper into the crisis since 1989.
The team of the controversial coach José Mourinho lost at West Ham United earning 1:3 (0:2) and with ten points after seven days of play only in the table midfield.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow ahead of the Champions League match on Tuesday against FC Valencia.
Former Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno came after an injury to Petr Cech to his first Premier League bet.
Prior to the 1899 Hoffenheim Champions League match on Tuesday, Manchester City won by goals from Raheem Sterling (29th) and Sergio Agüero (65th) 2-0 against Brighton&Hove Albion.
Leroy Sané prepared the 1-0, Ilkay Gündogan was not used in the new top rider.

The "Bild am Sonntag" (Bezhalinhalt) reports, citing Llambi's lawyer, on the separation of the well-known presenter and dance expert.

Polls: 46 percent don’t want Merkel as chancellor until 2021
After the riots of the past few weeks, GroKo has collected several poll hits.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a survey - Angela Merkel is seen critically.
Berlin - The AfD has overtaken the SPD for the first time in the Emnid Sunday trend for the image on Sunday nationwide.
In the weekly survey of the opinion research institute, the AfD increases by one counter to 17 percent, the SPD gives a point compared to the previous week and lands at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose one counter and only come to 27 percent.
This is the lowest value for the Union so far in the Sunday trend.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the Left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
If the federal election were on Sunday, the ruling parties SPD, CDU and CSU would get only 43 percent of the vote, according to Emnid.
Thus, the great coalition has lost the majority of the Sunday question at all major research institutes, with the exception of Allensbach.
The ruling parties consistently come to 43 to 45 percent of the vote (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 federal election, they received a total of 53.4 percent.
With the other parties, the bandwidth is also large: the AfD, the second-largest party in several surveys, comes to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens achieved a vote share of 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is at an average of 10 percent, the FDP at 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent upwards and downwards, depending on the share of votes.
But the support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has also fallen significantly since the 2017 federal election.
Currently, only 48 percent of citizens find that Merkel is the right person in the chancellor’s office, as the Emnid survey on behalf of the BamS revealed.
According to the survey, only one in two (50 percent) currently wants the large coalition to hold the next regular Bundestag election in three years, 41 percent are for a new election.
A further survey published on Saturday also revealed significant reductions in Merkel’s popularity.
Divided, the Germans also assess whether Merkel should run for the CDU presidency again in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are for it, 44 percent against it.
In the case of the Union supporters, 64 percent want a candidacy, 35 percent do not.
Aldi: Price reduced to love happiness
Will Aldi be Tinder 2.0?
Who says that in times of Tinder there are no more romantic acquaintance stories - he should talk to Aldi about turkey meat.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket radiates almost an anachronistic romance as a place of acquaintance for great love.
Yes, right, talking about reduced turkey meat, boxer shorts at the wobble table or the favorite pudding is in doubt still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The Tinder app is called to be less of a contact, but rather a slick stock exchange.
We dared the test: How do women react when you don’t talk around the hot porridge for long in the first message?
Here is the amazing result.
Regular Hollywood-Lovestory potential has it when love-happiness precedes an out-of-eye-lost-and-recovered plot.
If the guy then also registers with his worshippers at the email address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de, then this sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and Konsorten - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the author of this announcement in an Aldi branch unknown to us to wish that she will also find her dream man, with whom she has briefly talked about the "30 percent reduced organic punten meat".
For the belief in the magic of analog learning, she definitely earned her Happy End <0xC3><0xA0> la Hollywood.
Billerbeck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, Ludgerischule has been involved in the action "Cover against polio - 500 covers for a life without child paralysis".
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polioviruses.
The disease referred to in German as child paralysis leads from paralysis to death.
In Germany, polio is considered eradicated, but worldwide there are three countries where the disease occurs.
The cause of poliomyelitis, the polioviruses, can only be controlled by vaccinations, as a press release states.
Football: Reus and Zorc demand peace for idols
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB sports director Michael Zorc and captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion about the form and fitness of Mario Götze.
"We should stop thinking about Mario.
That's not good for the boy.
And that doesn’t do us any good,” said Reus, friends with Götze, after the 4:2 victory in Leverkusen at the TV channel Sky.
Zorc had already emphasized before the game.
For him personally, this is not an easy situation.
Football: Eberl: No rush in contract talks with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (dpa) - Manager Max Eberl from the football Bundesliga player Borussia Mönchengladbach sees no rush in a possible contract extension with coach Dieter Hecking.
We haven’t even talked about a contract yet.
There is no fixed date when we do this.
"But there will certainly be the moment where we sit down and talk," Eberl told Sky on Sunday evening.
Football: District League: Researcher appearance of VfL Wolbeck against SC Altenrheine takes courage
There were moments in this still young season, when Alois Fetsch went to court with his men hard.
Wortkarg, the coach of the football district league player VfL Wolbeck, first withdrew (internally) to feel the lack of performance on the green.
All history.
In the meantime, it’s back around the fireway again.
Taufrischer Beleg is the 1:1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine, in the past season only very thinly scrapped past the ascent.
Yes, I am very pleased with the performance.
"We narrowed the rooms and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen," said Fetsch, praising his boys and looking for each individual to simply say "thank you" for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - it went from 4-4-2 almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes was waiting for balls in front.
Wolbeck had significantly more stakes in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his departure (17th), the substituted Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
Almost that would have happened when the SCA hit dangerously in front of the Wolbeck box twice in minute 41 in person by Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberb<0xC3><0xA4>umer - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his subject.
After the break, the VfL took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters barely failed.
Schroer was also late after 58 minutes at a Thewes re-entry.
With the change of Miles Geske, Fetsch again missed a fresh cell cure on the left side.
When Altenrhein's Chris Naberb<0xC3><0xA4>umer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was an indirect free kick for the placers 18 meters in front of the guest house.
The foal itself started and demonstrated its danger to standards.
Westhues" thing with the right slash hit bottom left from the shooter's point of view - 1:0 (71.).
20 minutes, which should be fucking long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck accidentally flew the leather in the penalty room in the 80th minute.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79).
Worried minutes had to pass in the final phase before Geske still had the victory hit on the punch in the 87th minute from twelve meters.
Maybe it would have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes

Eintracht Frankfurt wins 4:1 against Hannover 96
Starting position: Four points after five days of play - that was not enough for coach Adi Hütter.

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
At the time of landing, the accident occurred at the airfield.
The four inmates were slightly injured.
Around 2 p.m. on Sunday, a drama took place at the airport in Kottingbrunn.
When a helicopter landed, turbulence occurred, police confirmed to oe24.
The heli was caught by a gust of wind, force on the ground and came to a standstill laterally.
Police, rescue and firefighters were immediately notified.
With a large bid, the emergency services came to the scene of the accident.
The <0xC3><0x96>AMTC emergency helicopter was also called for caution.
Inmates only slightly injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There is only one damage.
The four inmates were only slightly injured and were able to return home independently.
The exact circumstances of the accident have not yet been clarified and are the subject of the investigation.
According to firefighter Franz Resperger, there was a small source of fire, which, however, could be quickly removed again.
Allbright Foundation Report: Women remain a rarity in corporate boards
As a result, only 8 percent of the board members were female as of September 1, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture", which is officially presented by the Allbright Foundation this Monday and the German Press Agency in advance.
“The companies will have to behave differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass by them,” said foundation managing director Wiebke Ankersen.
In the United States, Great Britain or Sweden, purely male-occupied leadership teams – with a few exceptions – are no longer conceivable.
The gap makes the German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented in comparison.
It is a different corporate culture.
In addition, the slight increase in the proportion of women among German stock exchange companies was due solely to positive impulses in the companies of the index of medium-sized values (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the board members are female.
In the previous year, however, the value was still at 3.8 percent.
Among the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - the proportion of women stagnated.
Last year, 26 women worked on the boards.
"I'm sure the Dax companies will recruit more consistent women again next year - in their own interest," Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement had signalled that they would not continue to commit to increasing the proportion of “zero percent” so far.
Another picture is given by the supervisory boards: As of 1 September, the proportion of women there was 30.5 percent - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
“If there were just as many women recruited each year for the board of directors, a 40 percent share would have been achieved by 2023,” the report said.
Some even make Miese: Luxury carousels: Which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Ferrari deserves the best.
The Italians take 280,000 euros with each Ferrari sold and make 69,000 euros operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: this slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Who among the noble providers makes the most profit per car.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury manufacturers collect per car they sell?
"Autopapst" and professor of economics Ferdinand Dudenhöffer dealt with this question.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made 69,000 euros in profit in the first half of the year with every car sold - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes to around 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley even put a lot of effort into every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices of an average of 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros profit before interest and taxes EBIT.
On the day of her 38th birthday, tennis legend Martina Hingis announced on Twitter that she would become a mother for the first time.
The long-time No. 1 finished her career at the end of last year with 25 Grand Slam titles – five in a single – final.
In July, she married Harald Leemann.
She did not give birth.
Torch train to the opening of the 60th Abtswinder Wine Festival
With a torch train, the Tourist Association in Abtswind opened its wine festival session.
For the 60th time, the association organizes the wine festivals, which from then on rise every Saturday in October in the large festival tent on Rehweiler Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
At the start of the anniversary, the responsible persons moved to the festival square under the sounds of the Spielmannszug from Wiesenbronn.
In the already cramped festival tent, Wolfgang Starz, Mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests. "To do something like this for 60 years - this is an insane feat for a small place with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of that,” Starz thanked all the helpers.
Wine Princess Lisa II later symbolically emerged with the guests from the stage.
"Beautiful that so many have found their way to Abtswind again". Later, "Die Troglauer" caused mood.
On Sunday, on which the Abtswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the association had set the beverage prices as 60 years ago for the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon.
A festive evening for the 60th wine festival will take place on Friday, 5 October, in the guest’s house, before going into the second round one day later in the festival tent.
In Bonn: Notarztauto force in Taxi
An emergency car is severely damaged next to a road.
In the collision of the emergency vehicle with a taxi, a 27-year-old passer-by has been fatally injured.
When emergency doctors are called, they should help - best even save lives.
Such a rescue trip took a fatal end in Bonn for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - In the collision of an ambulance with a taxi, a 26-year-old pedestrian was fatally injured in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their driver were seriously injured, police said.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency car had a red light on Saturday afternoon with blue light and Martinshorn.
He then collided on a crossroad with the taxi that drove at Green.
After the collision, the doctor’s car slid against a light pole and a tree.
He captured the passer-by who died at the scene of the accident.
Driver of the ambulance and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the ambulance were severely injured in their vehicles and had to be freed from emergency forces.
The 29-year-old emergency doctor, who was also seriously injured, was able to free herself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another called-up emergency doctor tried this - but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close coordination with the Bonn prosecutor's office, determine who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United lose again, for Mourinho we feel uncomfortable
Manchester United now also lose in the 7th round of the Premier League.
ManU is subject to 1:3 against West Ham United, and the way of defeat is likely to continue.
The scene was symbolic in the 74th minute, in which Marko Arnautovic shot the 3:1 for West Ham; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford had supposedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
As they suspected an offside at Mark Nobel's pass, all of Manchester's defenders remained standing, leaving Arnautovic all the time in the world to pass the ball to the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative culmination of a previously inadequate performance over long distances.
The mood at United’s Manchester City rival is very different at the moment.
The citizens trained by Mourinho’s big competitor Pep Guardiola came against Brighton & Hove Albion to an undisputed 2-0 win.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke the outsider's defensive bar for the home team for the first time.
After a good hour and a double pass with the former goalkeeper, Sergio Agüero ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer the leader of the table
Three days after the 1:2 defeat in the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri won a 1-1 against Chelsea with Liverpool in the Premier League.
As in the cup-out, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in London.
The hit of the 27-year-old in the 25th minute remained the only hit of the game until the final stage.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, narrowly missed the compensation after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge did better in the 89th minute with his Schlenzer.
So after the Reds had started with a flawless balance sheet in the week, Chelsea was not to beat for the second time.
First, the Londoners eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, through which the draw in the league now also drove the Blues Liverpool from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London City clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) also celebrated 2-0 victories.
However, the fans of the Gunners, in which Granit Xhaka played through, had to wait until the 81st minute for a success message against the surprise team from the county of Hertfordshire.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart bugged an entry from Alex Iwobi unhappyly into his own goal, just two minutes later, Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil made the decision with his third season hit.
Arsenal moved past Watford thanks to the fifth consecutive win and is now directly behind the big rival Tottenham in 5th place. A strong impression continues to leave the riser Wolverhampton under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unbeaten for the fifth time in a row at 2-0 against Southampton and finished eighth.
VW brand missing: Paris Motor Show under the sign of diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years in exchange for the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not an issue and yet ubiquitous: The diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofits should not let the German car companies go free at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Motor Show, they will be showing their innovations from next week together with the competition from all over the world in the French capital.
The diesel doesn’t really matter much anymore.
The possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, however, should still be an important topic, at least behind the shiny backdrops of the exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is involved with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and have their first pure electric models with them: The e-tron of the Ingolst<0xC3><0xA4>dter is to be launched at the end of the year, the EQC of the Stuttgarter 2019.
Both have been officially presented.
BMW's iNext is scheduled to launch in 2021.
The focus in Paris is on the new 3rd.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors will be represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle builders as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are present in their own halls.
The trade fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in exchange for the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, there were a good 1 million visitors.
At least 380 people have been killed in the severe earthquakes and the following tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are more than 500 injured.
The island was shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had a strength of 5.9, the second had a strength of 7.4.
Communication and traffic connections are damaged, enormous property damage was caused.
After the quakes, the tsunami broke in over the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds gathered on the beach for a party.
It is feared that the number of victims will rise significantly.
The figures so far only come from Palu.
However, many other communities are also affected - along the west coast of Sulawesi.
About 150 bikers celebrate worship in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final service for motorcycle riders in the Peace Church in Eveking with a helper team on Sunday.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the pastoral interests of PS-strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle worship service (MoGo) at Haus Nordhelle always takes place on the last Sunday of a month.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Peace Church in Eveking.
Around 150 bikers had gathered there on Sunday to do anything but ordinary worship.
Already from 10 a.m. the Bolids were lined up in front of the entrance portal of the church.
First of all, the biker breakfasts were on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a strong curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was held during the Biker-God service parish priest Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical underpainting.
"Although the bikers prefer the blues rock, Valerie Lill is more likely to sound poetically calm," said Reverend Frank Schröder.
This too was certainly a novel in the history of motorcycle worship yesterday.
Fügtorfer Heimatverein celebrates big festival: after the apple comes the milk
And even on the actual day of action, Borisch was active.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg was also very interested.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated step by step the process from ripe apple to apple juice to his amazing spectators.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and had them fill the apples in the large hopper.
With a little muscle power, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Still, not many of the children could imagine how this should become a tasty drink.
But they were also able to look at this important step on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in moulds and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg piled the apple pieces layer by layer.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step was no longer so difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large container.
But the breeder farmer also had ready-filled specialties.
He opened his treasure chest and presented the latest feather whites to the older visitors.
The demand for the good drop "Made in fügtorf" was correspondingly high.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents came to the conversation, while the children could not only follow the process of apple pressing, but also discovered the built-up bouncy castle for themselves.
Also active members of the feudal comradeship of former soldiers took part in the festival and invited to entertaining games at some stations.
The home association will also offer an action day next year.
Then, however, Gregor Krützkamp stressed, the home in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious due to the topic: after all, it will then go around the milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth-season podium: "Bissesse Situation"
After the fourth Bundesliga defeat, coach André Breitenreiter gathered around his disappointed Hannover 96 professionals and gave them courage.
However, there was not much positive in the 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt before.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out of there as a team," said 96-football pro Pirmin Schwegler, squeezing, "that's disappointing, of course, because you always take a lot of action."
The further victorious Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86th) met for the connection, are at the very bottom with two counts and are in their current constitution a candidate for descent.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated the first home win of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45th+1), Jonathan de Guzm<0xC3><0xA1>n (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) scored the goals for the DFB Cup winner in front of 46,300 spectators, who, after the successful general test for the European League match against Lazio Rome, scored seven points in the middle of the table.
Croatia's vice world champion, Rebic, was almost involved in every dangerous offensive action by the Hessen during his start-up debut and never got in control of Hanover's defences.
After the World Cup, the striker, with his pace and assertiveness, showed why he is so valuable to conciliation.
In addition to Rebic, Brazilian Allan, who was loaned by Liverpool FC, was also the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurters, who started swinging.
Lucas Torr<0xC3><0xB3>'s headball, which was falsified on the goal net (17th), brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96-defendant around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term failed Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership for the landlords fell almost inevitably and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty room after a defensive corner, Haller extended his head in front of the gate, where Ndicka only needed to hold his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga match for the defensive player, who came in the summer from the French second-ligist AJ Auxerre.
And Frankfurt continued before the break.
This time Haller fitted his storm partner, Rebic, who was able to evaporate and left 96 goalkeeper Michael Esser no chance.
In the half-time, Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak performance of his eleven and brought in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt two new offensive forces.
The Lower Saxons now played a bit bolder forward, however, sparking ideas remained until shortly before the end, when after all, the follow-up hit still succeeded.
The Hessians were much more efficient.
After a short hour, Rebic started a solo and then placed across De Guzm<0xC3><0xA1>n, who had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was for the Frankfurters against overburdened guests only showcasing, Jovic also met a minute before the end.
Morlaix Square becomes a party mile
Despite cool temperatures, there was a good atmosphere at the Oktoberfest in the city centre.
The mayor of Munich Dieter Reiter managed to do so in front of millions of people at the opening of the 185th.
Municher Wies'n last week with two shots.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christians celebrate Holy Cross Feast
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross festival on September 14th or on Sunday after.
The service takes place in the city church, and then there is a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the closing ceremony.
The Church of the Holy Cross houses the shot Christ, who came from the 30-year war and on which the legend is said to have shot after a Swedish soldier.
Then blood came out of the gunshot wound.
From this a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ developed, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is not finished, only the altar room stands, the missing longhouse is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, pastor Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
In spite of the importance for the Geising parish, the service was poorly attended.
After the service, the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and with the final blessing, the ecclesiastical part of the Crucifixion ended.
For many years, the Catholic church choir has been inviting the secular part of the festival to the Catholic parish.
The choir members provided visitors with hearty food as well as a wide selection of cakes and weather adapted, farm ice cream.
In the afternoon, the parish still offered guided tours around the town church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone works and windows, as well as the upcoming construction measures, which will continue until next year.
After the scaffold has been standing for some time, the damage could be determined more precisely and the individual tenders prepared more concretely.
It is certain that the renovation will come more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing a few years ago has increased, but more has also been found, which was only made possible by the inspection of the eye by means of scaffolding.
The pedestal plastering work is completed, before the winter the natural stone works are to be started and it is hoped that half of these works will be completed this year.
Inauguration: New residential home in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstra<0xC3><0x9F>e
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens a new residential home for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
The fact that in the Münsterblickstra<0xC3><0x9F>e "a very special house" is now handed over to its destination - there were all those present at the inauguration date agreed.
Finally, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the shelter of the Donau-Iller Life Aid for some time now depend on the special architecture of the new building.
Wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas, architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former US Army officer building was put to the test for the residents with a mobile phone cap: "The house had come in the years and was no longer in the equipment at the time," Bader explained in retrospect.
In 2016, the excavators moved on to demolish the house.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible so that the residents can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens new residential home
About 4.6 million euros invested in life support in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, the district of Schwaben 450,000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained in the planned framework - both on time and financially.
The managing director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The gap between a barrier-free and fireproof design was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications, which allows the residents to experience the freedom to move even without foreign help.
Gertrud Kreutmayer, head of the social administration of the district of Schwaben, said: "The house is based on the special needs of its residents who need tools to be mobile".
The housing and functionality were well combined, Kreutmayer said.
And further: "The property in this situation is a real case of luck, because it can no longer be acquired in today's situation".
In total, the new residential home in Münsterblickstra<0xC3><0x9F>e offers space for almost 1500 square meters for 30 people with disabilities, which are divided into three groups of dwellings.
Proudly, Lebenshilfe Managing Director Heinz is on top of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed according to tariff.
Germany: Schwesig laments differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of unity, the deputy SPD Federal Chairman Manuela Schwesig has appealed to all the compatriots not to accept the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity.
We must not be satisfied with these differences," said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to the "day mirror on Sunday".
The goal must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans, on average, worked longer than the people of West Germany, but 15 percent less salary.
"I can't explain that to anyone almost 30 years after the German unity," Schwesig said.
North Korea: Does this dirty dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has given South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs a gift.
Moon’s office said on Sunday that the two dogs, about a year old, had already reached their recipient on Thursday.
They passed the border town of Panmunjom, along with three kilograms of dog food, to help the animals "adjust".
The dogs with thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are part of the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The gift of friendship was announced by the North at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
Both countries also agreed to compete together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and jointly apply for the 2032 Olympic Games.
In the course of the mutual rapprochement, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket drives.
Austria's moving history mirrored by 99 documents
What is Austria?
The 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months in this year of commemoration, has seen numerous new books, most of which answer this question in retrospect over the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archives, presents it in the magnificent "Bilderbuch" Austria, which will be published on October 1st.
New week, new opportunity for the government
Back to work – this is the unofficial motto for the Great Coalition’s week of work starting today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech, in which the chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU last did not mantra-likely conjure up the "return to material work".
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other working citizens in this country to ask the right question, which is actually the difference between work and material work, but that is the point.
If the Federal Government is now ready to re-dedicate itself to its mission - to govern - it should not be stopped with debate on terms.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually do something together after the provocations and blamages of the last few weeks will probably show Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the governing parties meet on the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly to defuse conflicts early; a lesson from all the controversy.
First of all, however, conflict-prone issues are again on the agenda with the Diesel retrofits and the Trade Force Immigration Act.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants the car companies to get away with exchange premiums, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers as obliged to retrofit older diesels.
While an approach has emerged over the weekend in the diesel crisis, the Union and the SPD are still far apart in the planned trade union immigration law.
The SPD calls for a stay-at-home perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or do an education.
The Union is strictly opposed to the "track change" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will again be disputes among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not equal and equal has joined the GroKo, but three partners with some very different social images and priorities.
Dispute is good.
Without dispute, a society marked by such diverse, sometimes conflicting interests does not advance.
In order to be constructive, however, disputes must not be restructured for party-tactical reasons on the question of being or not being.
This is still about politics, not theatre.
The Union and the SPD are supposed to fight - but always keep an eye on the reality of people's lives.
What is feasible and useful for many?
With this guiding question, both the diesel and the lane change question can be pragmatically clarified - and thus regain confidence.
This is especially the case with the people’s parties now having to fight.
Mushroom checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in vision
Does the Minister of Labour violate the applicable employment law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
“Really day and night” her legalists had worked on social security reform, reported an exuberant social minister at the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
At Liste-Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger, the statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FP<0xC3><0x96>) comes at a surprise - she now brings the matter to Parliament via request.
She assumes that the minister only expressed her enthusiasm for the use of her team and did not at all want to announce violations of current service law in front of running cameras.
Nevertheless, she now has questions to be able to free Har tinger "from any suspicion."
Police tear up a street in search of women's bodies
Marxgrün - For a long time the police did not want to comment on this.
Now there is a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the state road between Naila and Bad Steben has been dug.
The route is closed until Monday in the area of Marxgrün.
It was predicted that the investigators had previously used an archeology dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, was finally able to limit the relevant spot to a few meters, together with his guide in repeated use.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the top Bavarian monument protection authority in the area of the said street piece.
For more than a year now, the prosecutor’s office and the criminal police have been working on the missing case.
Again and again a cycle path was blocked at Marxgrün and investigated with sonar devices, because the investigators suspect that Heike’s body could have been blocked here in the course of the new construction of the state road 30 years ago.
Color powder and eggs: riots in Barcelona before Catalonia anniversary
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia will be held for the first time.
But before that, there were riots.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Just before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of October 1, 2017, clashes between separatists and police took place in central Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by independence advocates, among other things, using colour powder to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Around 3,000 police officers from Polic<0xC3><0xAD>a Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honor their colleagues with a rally that was in use last year at the illegal referendum in the polling stations.
In an attempt to prevent citizens from voting, violence had also occurred at that time.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and central government security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
Some of the approximately 6,000 separatists, however, would have tried to break the police chain by force, and the officials, among other things, would have thrown paint bags and eggs.
Six people were arrested, 24 others were slightly injured, the authorities said.
On Monday, the independence referendum will be held for the first time.
After the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the affluent region of Spain, the central government in Madrid had placed Catalonia under forced administration in the autumn of 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled into exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also went abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement, on the other hand, are still in U-Haft.
New elections were held in the region in December.
After the entry into office of the new Catalan government in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But also the new regional president Quim Torra insists on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen split torlos
Red-and-white Ahlen continues to appear on the spot.
Even at FC Gütersloh it was only a 0-0 draw.
In front of 438 spectators in the Heidewaldstadion, the final light and the third-last one debunked them as assembled inconsistency.
The first half was quite manageable by the entertainment factor.
Anyone who would rather get a beer or a sausage could do this without any worries.
There was no risk of missing out on a Torch, because there were practically none.
First shot after half an hour
For the first (harmless) goal shot of the entire game, Gütersloh's Nick Flock was responsible for the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle the only real - possibility had the Ahlens, when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling to a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty area limit.
Even more harmless were the hosts.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Sturmer Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, for him came Sinan Aygün.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the growing boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel scored just above the housing from 18 meters and after an hour, the freighters also appeared offensively for the first time.
After a ball conquest by Matth<0xC3><0xA4>us Wieckowicz it was fixed.
Nick Flock (62.) "crowned" the fast-paced counter over Sinan Aygün with a but sloppy shot in the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, they dropped a headball from Wieckowicz (66) after a corner ball by ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut responded, initially bringing Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and slightly later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70th).
It did - nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative, the Ahleners did not bring about.
It wasn’t until the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but it also brought nothing.
Angelo Daut then tried to point out the positive: "I like that we played to zero", but unfortunately the zero also stood in the front.
“We weren’t as dangerous this time as we were against wooden wickets and even though our opponent didn’t want to play here,” said RW Ahlen’s interim coach.
Offensively, everything "split a bit" against a team that "just wanted to defend.
At least I didn’t feel like we could get a counter door,” Daut said.
To his suffering, however, as a spectator, one did not feel as if his team could score a goal.
For that, the idea was too poor.
Reckenfelder Erntedankmarkt: Fortunately, there are enough Kreimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder table publishing point, for which these donations are intended.
The volunteers assure: "These donations also remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening, the sky was shining blue, but the space was still a little empty, but that was to change over the course of the day.
Because: "It's so nice here, so we're here today," said one visitor.
The organiser of the Franz Josef Holthaus party welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a decent prise humor.
For the Brockmann couple, who were supposed to be weighed against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in the short term.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough critters.
And the "replacement" could not be taken to entertain the ever-increasing visitors musically in between.
It was so good that some folk songs were sung later in the day.
"Just great," Marcel Kreimer was pleased.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to place the opening date in his schedule this time.
He is pleased with the many active people with their stands, including mostly clubs.
"Actually, there should be no such thing as a table at all," he nevertheless thanked himself for the action of the men's choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all those who were in use at the booths and also included the other festivals that took place in September and the "Clean up" action.
Our garden town gives itself a colorful paintwork - here's what's going on.
Then the Maikranz was taken by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire brigade and taken to the winter quarter.
Many stalls worked for the physical well-being.
Everything from sweet to hearty was to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only lived in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative at his decouper saw.
Veneer work, beer lid with shrimp fields motifs and much more he had on offer.
One specialty offered three beekeeping fields: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter has a speciality.
Honey cakes in the glass, of course with honey from my own production.
There the little Elsa had to access again and again, the cake tasted so good.
The conviviality is what made the visitors linger long into the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Lubrications with a local political message: No successful advertising for skate facilities
In Lengerich, unknowns have hardly promoted the construction of a skate facility in a beneficial way.
In several places there are corresponding lubricating works, says Jürgen Kohne of the city administration at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, a criminal complaint has been filed with the police for property damage.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" were stamped on signs at the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that already after the professional election fair on 19 September, a corresponding letter on the billboard at the staircase to the Gempt bistro was discovered.
Since the short message at the time was apparently "only" left with an edding, it could easily have been removed.
“A few days later, it was back, this time sprayed up,” Rottmann said.
It assumes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
A special note is given to this particular case by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the board.
If the skate facility is built, its realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already promises, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the municipal department of school, sport and culture, without mentioning names.
However, it is quite possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the smeared board.
For years, local politics and administration have been dealing with the topic of skateboarding.
After the old one had been dismantled at the LWL clinic, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
After all, the Council voted in favour of the Fire Department parking lot.
However, this idea was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a construction at this point.
At the end of June, a turnaround followed.
The members of the main and financial committee now voted unanimously for the area of the Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of things that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word was from the city council.
It is based on a decision this year, so that a positive vote could be made in 2019.
Air traffic congestion is getting worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, the German air traffic controllers do not see any signs of improvement in the coming year.
“This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm comes,” said Matthias Maas, the head of the air traffic control union, the German press agency ahead of the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight downtimes is the long-known staff shortage in European air traffic control systems, for which there is no quick solution.
“The airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots will take four to five years,” the union said.
Europe-wide, the market for well-trained pilots is empty-handed.
Around a hundred people were missing in the center of Karlsruhe alone to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas again criticized the fact that various air traffic unions were not invited to the summit.
In the Hanseatic city, representatives of the federal government, the countries, air traffic control, airlines and airports will meet on Friday to address the causes of the delays.
“If you want to talk about additional work compression and overtime, this will not happen without us,” explained the head of the GdF, which has many members at the German air traffic control company.
Maas once again blamed the EU Commission’s guidelines for the lotteries.
Traffic forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 were far too low.
The resulting costs and personnel savings in the national air traffic control systems are now fully reflected in the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Minister of Transport Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for regulations that "do not cut the air even further".
At present, the EU's requirements would be aligned by 2024 and there should be further aggravation to be feared.
The EU is constantly subject to lobbying pressure from airlines.
"Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown in recent years," Maas said.
He hopes that the high delay costs of airlines will initiate a rethink.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German Aviation Safety Authority (DFS) offers a "voiced training and future pact", Maas said.
The previously announced admission of 120 pilot pupils over the next five years is just enough to offset age-related declines.
The necessary personnel structure is not yet connected to this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board Votes for Group Conversion
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the plans to restructure the Group.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp interim chief Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Board at the meeting on Sunday, the crisising Group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies will be based in Essen and listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional personnel reduction beyond the already known reductions in administration.
After two resignations, the control body on the capital side counts only eight heads.
There are ten representatives of the employees.
However, the final decision is expected to take a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG will include, among other things, the 50 percent share of the merged steel business with Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business is to be bundled with elevators and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence at Demos by Police Officers and Catalan Independence Advocates.
At two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan independence advocates in Barcelona, there have been violent clashes with numerous injured.
According to the city administration, on Saturday about 3,000 police officers from all over Spain gathered, as well as about 6,000 independence advocates demonstrated.
The Catalan police tried with a large bid to keep the two protest trains away from each other.
However, according to the emergency services, independence advocates repeatedly tried to break the security barrier.
You would have attacked the officers with paint and throwing shots.
According to the reports, the ranks were also among the participants of the various protest trains.
According to emergency services, 24 people were injured.
Police said there were six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
With their demonstration, the police wanted to honour the colleagues who had taken action almost exactly one year ago against the independence referendum in Catalonia, which was banned by the Spanish central government.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do.
The demonstrators felt it was a provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez of the AFP news agency.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they choked us a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name to Daniel, rejected the accusation.
“Of course, we want to support our comrades, who just did their duty last year: defend the law,” he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because it is a big European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues “did not come to provoke,” the policeman assured.
Panne allowed access to personal data of British minister
A vulnerability in a mobile app has caused the personal data of ministers and deputies of the Conservative British Tory Party to be temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknowns after the breakdown became known a day before the Tory party in Birmingham.

Football: Juve coach praises top game: Ronaldo's best match
The Portuguese star striker had "played the best game this evening along with half an hour of Valencia," Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri praised after the 3-1 (1:1) victory of the record champion against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensive bought star was the decisive man in the important match against the pursuer even without his own goal.
“Ronaldo had a lot of fun and is doing well,” Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from that moment on we have grown.
Thanks to Ronaldo’s three goals, Juve shot the game after the early backlash by hitting Dries Mertens (10th minute) and hanged the worst pursuer for the time being.
The goalkeeper, who was picked up by Real Madrid, initially put on the lead by former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who provided the lead with a double pack (26th/49th).
And after a corner per headball Ronaldo also did the preliminary work on the hit by defensive chief Leonardo Bonucci (76th), who only had to push in just before the goal line.
"He gives a lot of templates," the coach praised.
But Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record goalkeeper in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
“We need to get even better at serving him,” the coach said.
Best Juve goalkeeper is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three in the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, Juventus’s dominance seems to be even more oppressive.
Seven wins in seven games is the flawless series in Serie A. At 21 points, the champion of the past seven years already has six counters ahead of Naples.
The second table, which was coached by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not without chance against Turin.
But at the latest after the place reference of the already warned Mario Rui (58th) the top game was decided.
The Portuguese had to go hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red from the square.
“We played well against a good Naples,” commented the Turin coach.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel this.
The German national player has prevailed at Juve.
The professional, who came from Liverpool FC, was in use in all seven league games.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League match against Valencia, which Allegri said with the "half hour": Ronaldo had flown off the pitch in the 2-0 victory of the Turins and was locked up for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
With a particularly quirky appearance, rapper Kanye West paid attention to the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" on the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume ensured the audience’s forehead curls and question marks.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change on time for the release of his new album.
From now on, you can only call him "Ye," according to the musician.
"The creature formerly known as Kanye West," he tweeted in response to the late singer Prince when he dropped his stage name.
However, the pseudonym is not news.
The tenth album was released under that name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist had stated that "Ye" had a religious significance for him.
"I think "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means "you," says the rapper.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
Done!
Hoetmar’s coach Averhage did not make a hell of his disappointment.
It was a weak game for us today.
The opponent was just more gruelling, we almost never put him in trouble". The list of Hoetmarer shooting possibilities reads as thin as possible.
Gradually two chances of scoring in 90 minutes, so that games can rarely be positively shaped.
Football circuit A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two options in the first passage, the first but used Maik Krause from an acute angle for early guidance (7th).
In the 43rd minute, Steffen Uphus could have increased, but after great preparation from Krause he transformed freely standing.
The hosts only had a double chance when initially Moritz Höne failed at goaltender Jos Schuhmacher and in the follow-up Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69) all forgave.
A trade meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved on the goal line by hand and saw red for it - Niklas Eilmann also could not use it for the guests (75th).
Only when Nils Berheide shuffled the ball over the line was the game decided (81).
“We had criticized ourselves hard before, and that was different today than in the last few weeks,” said Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77th Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th Leibig), Turl.
Gates: 0:1 Krause (7th), 0:2 Berheide (81th).
Red card: Kortenjann (75./Hoetmar).
Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacular football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
“I don’t know what to think,” he said.
"We don't have access to them at all." He probably meant the wing pliers with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but probably also all the other green-whites that came up with collective offensive urge.
He could still laugh: “A dirty victory,” he said, wavering cheekyly and pulling from then on His players, on the other hand, was the relief to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Well-noted, after a duel of two teams, one of which, namely Albachten, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for the class preservation.
With mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes behind him.
“This was by far our best season performance,” he says.
"As we come back after the 0:2 as we hold back against one of the league's top teams over the entire season, that was really phenomenal".
The more bitter it seems that you now have to drive home empty-handed.
Top goalkeeper Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th season hit (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
He placed the 2-0 mark on the left side for Fabian Fröhning (39th).
We knew that, but you can’t take such a player out completely.
"That was already madness, what he did," Lewandowski recognized the quality of the opponent's attitude.
Shortly before the change of sides, his own elf managed to compensate: McGill's free kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe into the long toreck (45th).
After the side change, it was again McGill who achieved the compensation (59th).
Then it went back and forth.
It was a crazy, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64th), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann (69th).
Despite the excess, Albersloh was no longer able to counter the last Concordia meeting (80th).
We must now focus our full attention on Wednesday.
“The game against sheepskins, that’s what we have to win now,” Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th Bareksai).
Tore: 1:0 Zymner (24th), 2:0 Fröhning (39th), 2:1 McGill (45th), 2:2 McGill (59th), 3:2 Nübel (64th), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69th), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80th).
Yellow-red: Atalan (74th/Albachten).
Football: TSV Stra<0xC3><0x9F>berg wins points against Primus
There was no winner in the Bundesliga duel between the TSV Stra<0xC3><0x9F>berg and the FV Biberach.
The leader of the table had actually arrived for three points, but the team of coach Oliver Pfaff stood very well and in the end the game ended 0:0.
Media: Total Bureau of Dynamo Dresden Resigned
According to media reports, the entire Bureau of Football-Zweitligist Dynamo Dresden has resigned.
Several media in the evening called for a joint letter from the panel of the Saxons.
There was no confirmation of the association at first.
The reason for the withdrawal should be internal power struggles with the former Bundesliga.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of Pompeii
I'm glad he's gone again.
There are only a few state guests whose departure in Germany provides as much relief as those of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
For three days, the Turkish president was a guest in Berlin and Cologne, and many had thought that he should not have been invited at all.
Evangelische Akademie Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelische Akademie Tutzing offers about 80 meetings by the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has signalled that he would like to personally collect the Tolerance Prize in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as Federal President, he was not in Tutzing’s Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was a guest there.
For example, Academy Director Udo Hahn counted on him when he proudly said: "All the Federal Presidents and Chancellors have already been with us". That at the Academy in Tutzing's castle, celebrities appear again and again, but was also a topic during the presentation of the annual program.
At the end of October, Konstantin Wecker takes part in a meeting about spiritual experience in a philosophical perspective, on September 29th, the writer Frido Mann is at a meeting about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has also promised that he will personally receive the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which in another category also receives television presenter Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The approximately 80 meetings until mid-2019 have it in themselves.
"The pension is not safe!" is a title of the conference.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - this is how the Academy describes the "risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And at a conference on Syria: "Barbaria without limit".
Weapon deals, destruction, torture, death - war mocks every human idea".
From structural racism in society to the scissors between the poor and the rich to the radical change of work through digitization, the spectrum is sufficient.
Academy Director Hahn said: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions or at least for partial solutions."
At a meeting on the 200th.
Karl Marx's birthday soon awaits the one more visitor to the direction of capitalism-criticism, the other more a tendency "from the left to the middle".
What about neutrality?
“We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical State Church,” said study leader Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, “so we are not 100 percent neutral.”
Music cabaret: Gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westphalian News
"Both for adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christ Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret girl, Teubner made the gender connection, not only with humor and warmth of heart for the (feeled) woman and (feeled) man and what else there may be, but also with music.
The mini-guitar used her and also mastered her violin.
Ben Süverkrüp was sitting on the wing.
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes also comes to the end of the sentence, on the other hand a true pianist: So congenially harmoniously accompanies Süverkrüp Teubner that some may have wanted a solo.
There was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, namely, as it suited the Red thread of the evening.
Then Teubner had brought a paradox into play: the satisfaction of the man comes, if he has a partner, but does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, does not bring any benefit.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same thing: What would have arisen from Mozart’s composing, would “the Nannerl” have opened the door unexpectedly?
So Sükrüp glides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt full of blood and wounds" into the "Song of Death", and from Mozart's g minor symphony into a playful dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Flowers presented Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, the chansonette.
But the chairman Heidemarie Markenbeck could not take an additional thank you.
She had the idea to treat the duo to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt as well as one in Wolbeck.

The SEC accused Musk of making false and misleading statements.
Bruchsal.
After a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police slightly corrected the victim numbers down.
There were 10 passengers injured instead of 15.
All of them have since been released from the hospital.
The French bus driver had remained in the hospital for one night for observation.
He was fired during the day, a police spokesman said.
The reason for the accident of the bus at Bruchsal is still unclear.
The bus was unbraked frontal on Saturday morning against a guideboard.
Handball: Women's national league: Ahlener SG barely keeps the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahleners had problems, especially with third-team player Carolin Stallmann, who alone scored ten goals.
"I was actually very pleased with the defense, only one player scored too many goals.
We didn’t get them under control,” said ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more concerned about the many missed opportunities.
The focus at the finish left his team missing this time.
The ASG therefore ran almost to the end behind a backlog, lying at 11:12 and later still at 15:18 (45.) behind.
It was only towards the end that the wider bank of the hostesses became decisively noticeable.
In addition, Aydogdu put Merle Klement back on the left, which then made "extremely clever the decisive goals" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Bushkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pump, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd League Women: Top performance of the BSV Ostbevern in the top game at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball women of the BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd League West.
In the second-liga downhill VC Allbau Essen won the blue-whites with 3:1.
“It was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz to play in the upper third of the league.
We have now worked this out,” coach Dominik Münch was delighted to see his team’s almost impeccable performance at the fallen leader of the table.
The first passage almost dominated the guests at will.
Over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went to the vicemaster of the previous year at 25:15.
Food has been accepted in the two-bar, but has not come into play.
We did a good job with her.
Our opponent has raised high risk, but also produced several tickets.
In the second sentence, the BSV already led at 12:8. "Eating has changed the assumption to three-bar.
We couldn't hold the pressure.
Food has sucked itself up, and we've let ourselves be a bit engrossed," Münch continued.
At 18:17, the volleyball women from the Ruhr area had their noses in front for the first time.
Although Ostbevern defended four sets of balls at 19:24, the fifth attempt, however, found its goal.
"The game was now a class better," said the practice leader to the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly with their spreads that the BSV turned the sheet in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: "We played consistently and quietly".
Over 7:3 and 15:13 the blue-and-white passage four with 25:22 brought to their side.
Vera Horstmann was chosen as the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier had also captured an excellent day.
BSV-Women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish community: Mosque opening as missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way in which the Grand Ditib Mosque in Cologne was inaugurated by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left behind in the German-Turkish relationship a heap of shards, which can only be laboriously combined," said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and the German sides had missed the chance to make a joint, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of emphasizing the Muslim affiliation with Germany alongside German top politicians, Erdogan has used the date for his purposes," Sofuoglu lamented.
The widespread exclusion of the German public has "enhanced many reservations".
Heimatverein Nottuln: Offer has already established itself
After the long summer break is finally Folktreff time again.
On October 18 (Thursday) at 7.30 p.m., the Nottuln home association is already hosting its fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the fireplace room of the Alte Amtmannei.
Almost to the day exactly it was a year ago that we conducted a folk reunion for the first time.
Meanwhile, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln,” says Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I wouldn’t have thought that our folk reunion would fade so quickly in Nottuln eta.
Whether stormy Friederike in January or heat wave in July, the fire room of the Amtmannei was always fully occupied.
"The program at the next Folktreff is, as always, a colorful mix of German folk, hiking and seaman songs, folk songs, evergreens and old drummers," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who always invites friends musicians to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer has promised his accordion for the first Folktr<0xC3><0xA4>ff "Birthday".
For many years he was a member of "Gaitling", a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt that played music with German lyrics.
Now he's on the road with an Irish folk band.
The makers of Folktreff like to remember the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz of Folktreff Emsdetten with his international version of the song "Frösche in der Nacht" delighted the listeners and sent them home with an earworm.
"We expect many happy guests to spend a social and humorous evening again," the invitation from the home club reads.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to actively contribute is invited to participate.
Since the desired seats are always occupied quickly, it is advisable to be there early enough.
The folk gathering starts at 7.30 pm, but admission is already at 7 pm.
China approves proposed merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all open questions must be resolved by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking another step forward on their way to becoming the world’s largest industrial gas group.
The Chinese Competition Authority approved the proposed merger, Linde said on Sunday.
Thus, for the multi-billion dollar merger, permits are still pending in South Korea and – as the biggest hurdle – in the United States.
Recently, the chances of an insider’s approval had improved because Linde promised to sell additional company parts.
For legal reasons, all open questions must be resolved by 24 October in order for the merger to succeed.
From pure orchards to ecology
With a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle, the 125th anniversary of the Association for Horticulture and Land Care was celebrated.
On 29 September 1893, with a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, the last impulses were set for the Kulmbach Association for Horticulture and Landespflege, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a big anniversary in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle on Saturday evening.
Of course, he was still different at the time: As "Bezirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land" he was baptized by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the orchard association was also different from today's work - it was actually purely about orchard, no one thought about flowers and horticulture at the time.
"At that time, in the era of Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," said Günter Dippold, the county home caretaker.
Fruit trees were supposed to line long-distance roads, so-called industrial gardens were created in schools.
Fruit cultivation is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7000 members.
However, the spectrum is far from exhausted.
A natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play an equally important role as the imparting of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutchdorf youth group "Maulwürfe" showed how versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are.
“Young people’s work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age,” said Günter Reif, chairman of the circle, and OB Henry Schramm, who also stressed the importance of experiences in nature for life.
For us children, collecting chestnuts was a huge thing, I doubt that you can collect a similar amount of joy with Smartphone & Co..
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they are to stand, the county council decides", added Landrat Söllner and highlighted the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The circle association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green spaces in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the county left no doubt about it, even the district manager and specialist consultant Friedhelm Haun.
He led the many visitors through the long history of the Circle Association with an image lecture and reported, among other things, the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past everything came out of the garden, for the winter it was stuffed.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the utility garden turned into an ornamental and residential garden.
“Nature has survived, it was already there before us and we have to orient ourselves to it,” the expert for fruit and nut trees argued.
That is why the horticultural associations give the incentive not to let go, so that our home remains beautiful and worth living.
This also includes welcoming the new citizens in our associations, added the President of the Bavarian National Association, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We have to stop the blatant decline in insects, we owe it to our children and grandchildren," concluded Günter Reif, who was solemnly framed by the towerblowers of the music club Thurnau.

Priority on Nafta talks: Canada’s foreign minister postpones UN speech
Mexico’s government wants clarity on Nafta: they put both trading partners an ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada’s foreign minister now gives absolute priority to the trade agreement – and postpones her speech before the United Nations.
Because of the time pressure to fight for a reissue of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the United States and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of today’s Saturday, the minister will not speak until Monday before the United Nations General Assembly, her spokesman Adam Austen said.
Meanwhile, they focus on the renegotiation of Nafta.
Mexican economy minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that Canada’s negotiators and the United States would have 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wanted to join the trade agreement already reached between its country and the United States.
In August, the US and Mexico agreed to a recast of the regional free trade agreement Nafta.
U.S. President Donald Trump suggested that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
The talks about a new edition have been going on for over a year.

Protests against presidential candidates Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a trade fair attack, has left the hospital.
The far-right ex-military wanted to fly to R<0xC3><0xAD>o de Janeiro, where he lives, according to a report by the daily newspaper "O Globo".
After his dismissal, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will make public appearances in the South American country last week before the presidential elections.
At the beginning of September, the politician was attacked on an open road during an election campaign event in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele n<0xC3><0xA3>o" (in German: "Der nicht") women's associations had called for protests against the ex-military.
In the social networks, the associations against Bolsonaro also made racist and anti-women statements mobile.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo.
In the capital Brasilia, the protests met with a rally of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He was replaced by former President In<0xC3><0xA1>cio Lula da Silva, who was sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and is therefore not allowed to run for office.
The presidential election in Brazil is on October 7.
As ex-citizen master of the millions city of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo, Haddad was far behind Bolsonaro, the extreme right-wing candidate, in surveys so far.
Although Brazil’s “Trump” has been involved in politics for a long time, it has recently presented itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reach the absolute majority in the first round of voting, there will be a no-vote vote on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge successfully from this - no matter who he is competing against.
Bolsonaro is known for fighting homosexuals and blacks and for glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Again and again he is shocked with verbal distractions.
Another time, he said, the supporters of Lula's left-wing workers' party should be shot.
Europe recovers Ryder Cup title
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Just an hour away from Disneyland, European golfers have written another Ryder Cup fairy tale in front of the gates of Paris.

After a long illness: Danish rock legend died
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen has died.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen announced on Larsen's website.
At the deathbed, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become famous with the band Gasolin', which was hugely successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Her songs were influenced by international music such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the dissolution of the band in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold about three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Mid at Night" is still the best-selling album in Denmark.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen in a statement on Sunday as "street boys" who "were against everything but in all hearts".
The head of government also recalled that the monarchy opponent Larsen had appeared on the 70th birthday of Danish Queen Margrethe II in 2010.
Rock Night in the Shoe Factory: Volume at Press Air Hammer Level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and light a concert evening with the power of a tiger", the band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" suggest such a rewrite of the rocky live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: Hardrock pure of three other friends bands.
After the sound check and shortly before the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There is no trace of lamp fever.
After that, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in conjunction with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands loudly excite the around 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows to convince with the opening of the concert evening also with newest, unknown pieces from his own pen and the soon-to-be-released CD.
In front of the stage, the band dances to a harmonious and powerful interplay.
Although "Add" calls cannot be ignored, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
The fact that hard rock is not the same as hard rock demonstrates guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on the bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of classic rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" a synthesizer is used in "Here We Stand" in addition to the guitar rock.
Not only the yearning, almost ballad-like "Take Me Home" impresses with the change from melodic passages to the guitar-heavy rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
However, the quartet "The Ignition" from Tannish<0xC3><0xA4>uschen has gained a special level of fame since its foundation in 2005.
Full of agility, the band will present their hard rock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" has a special stage experience with her performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 tour in China - is obvious and inaudible.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann, in collaboration with the band, also sets his own accents on the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
For the sound that feels even higher than before, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a cheery solo while running through the audience.
Of course, a certain volume is part of this kind of hard rock concert: At the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to the mixing console team, the three-part concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at press air hammer level, but is thus still clearly under the control of the "Wacken-Fesitvals", pointing to the "The Ignition" on their website.
120 decibels in jet engine volume as usual at the annual metal stage in the north of the Republic, but the Ahlen audience does not need this rock night.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocky gait have long convinced with their sovereign, virtuosic play and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, have taken the bone saw and lit a concert evening with the power of a tiger," all three groups, of course in the transmitted sense, can say in the end.
And above all enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A dead person in a plane crash at Essen/Mülheim airport
There was a fatal accident at Mülheim/Essen airport.
On Sunday, a sailplane crashed in a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen airport.
The pilot died in the accident.
Near Mülheim/Essen airport, a fatal accident occurred on Sunday.
As the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" reports, a glider had crashed at the exhibition car park at the airport.
The pilot was killed.
As the "WAZ" further reports, the flight student was alone on board - the plane is supposed to be a one-seater.
The plane was already on land at the time of the accident.
The crash site is located just a short distance from a tent on the airport grounds.
An Oktoberfest has been held since this weekend.
The airport Mülheim/Essen is located at the city border of the two Ruhr area cities and directly at the ascent to the motorway 52.
From the car park there is a Park&Ride offer at major events at Essen Fair or Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump says to Kim, “And then we fell in love.”
The fact that Kim, the leader of North Korea, is well-deserved despite the nuclear crisis, is no secret.
But now Trump has made a real declaration of love to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim’s “beautiful letters.”
At the tender age of 72, the married U.S. president has announced a new flame.
The Tragic: It's a long-distance relationship.
On Saturday, Donald Trump made North Korean leader Kim Jong Un an unusual declaration of love.
In front of supporters in the U.S. state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-old spire of the Pyongyang ruling dynasty, although in the struggle for North Korea’s nuclear disarmament, it turns out to be quite tough chunks.
“I was tough, he was too, and between us it went back and forth,” Trump said.
And then we fell in love.
- Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim would have made his heart melt.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne political fruit: Trump referred to the stop of all nuclear and missile tests announced by Kim, even though critics have so far seen little more than lip service.
That affection for the “Rocket Man” infamously named for his martial-threats, Trump’s nickname for Kim, not everyone should be remembered, seemed to be quite aware of the President of the United States.
In any case, he immediately anticipated the criticism that would be expected when he appeared in a large sports hall in Wheeling City: “Donald Trump says they fell in love.”
How terrible, how terrible is that?
This is so imprecise.
But he doesn’t care much, Trump explained, and then pointed his finger at the crowd: “I’ve always told you it’s so easy to be presidential.”
But then there would not be 10,000 people out there pushing into this crowded arena, but we would only have 200 people out there.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler’s best visited, atmospheric and also spoiled by sun full: Very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfestflair Baesweiler’s city centre washed out on Sunday.

Refugees rescued from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have pointed out their catastrophic detention conditions in Libya by means of a cell phone video, thus enabling them to be rescued.
The group had filmed and distributed the recording in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July in danger of life.
"They refuse to send us back," a man in the video message said.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the France 24 Observers website, whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown out to Nigeria at the end of August.
“Without the video, we probably wouldn’t have been able to return to Nigeria,” Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, told AFP.
The 25-year-old had been arrested in Libya in an attempt to cross the Mediterranean to Europe.
With the video, he put himself at risk of life, according to his own statement.
One of his fellow fighters was almost beaten to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the detention conditions were catastrophic: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary return of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been sent back to their home country this year with the help of the program, said IOM spokesman in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the now-saved Nigerians is not exceptional in view of the poor detention conditions in Libya.
However, he has not heard of a call for help via mobile phone video.
International organizations have long criticized the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as humane.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the elementary school on Sunday afternoon to prepare her classes for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
Around 16:50 the teacher entered the building via the main entrance.
In the front of the first floor, she saw a man who fled immediately.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there via a ladder into the ground floor or the forecourt.
The teacher informed the police who took the investigation.
Whether things or money have been stolen cannot yet be said.
16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker appearance, dark pants, dark T-shirt.
Please refer to the Obernberg am Inn Police Inspection, phone number 059 133 4244.
German was trapped in his own car for days
A 75-year-old has had to wait several days and nights in his car in a wooded area in central Franconia after he had jammed the car off all the forest paths and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescuers accidentally discovered the car on Saturday afternoon near a pasture and freed the missing since Tuesday evening, police said on Sunday.
According to Pleinfeld, the 75-year-old was in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he had not returned on Tuesday from a ride with his off-road vehicle over the local meadows and fields.
Despite intensive search measures, the man’s stay for days remained unclear.
Laschet urges rule of law in Turkey
Köln NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) in talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has called for the rule of law in Turkey.
The relations of the two countries are currently "overshadowed," Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This concerns, above all, the wave of arrests, freedom of the press and freedom of religion.
He has therefore made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalize in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, that the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this.”
Laschet also addressed the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan once again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been briefly moved to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defence’s readiness for flight at Cologne Airport.
Originally, it was supposed to take place at Wahn Castle - but the castle owners had rejected this out of political conviction against Erdogan.
After the conversation, Erdogan continued to travel to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said, “The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country.”
And we are also their contact persons - and not the Turkish President.
Lack of confidence in the U.S.: North Korea demands disarmament
While US President Trump is not tired of emphasizing the success of negotiations on North Korea’s denuclearization, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri is calling for a meeting of Washington.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the U.S. government of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula during the UN general debate, with its ongoing sanctions.
“The recent standstill comes from the fact that the U.S. is building on coercive measures that are deadly for confidence building,” Ri said in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea under these circumstances.
“Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there will be no way that we will first disarm ourselves,” the North Korean chief diplomat said.
“The fact that sanctions could force North Korea on the ‘knee’ is a dream of people who don’t know us.”
To build trust, however, his country stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri highlighted.
However, there were no “responding reactions” from the US side, the minister criticized.
Because of North Korea’s nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council decided three times last year to impose sanctions on the internationally isolated country.
US President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have been urging the United Nations to strictly comply with the sanctions in recent days.
At the same time, the US government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump met North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un for the first time.
After the first summit in Singapore, the President of the United States is aiming for a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo will again travel to Pyongyang for talks on the end of the North Korean nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the community
The fact that they were actually in a youth gathering, of which the many visitors of the house of the open door HoT got nothing: white blankets and flower ornaments on the tables and a large buffet were waiting for the guests after the harvest thank God service.
The young people of the HoT had enchanted the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The establishment was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank themselves with the food.
The start with the new facility was not exactly easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, recalls.
We had our refrigerators filled with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then the first day after the summer break came the bad surprise: a power outage had put out the huge, two-piece refrigerator, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start again: although we got a lot of support from friends and neighbors, but the children and young people wanted to do it alone," Westbuer said.
And that's how everyone got involved.
The result could be seen, the guests were thrilled.
"It can't be better for cooks either," said one visitor impressed, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to serve quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It's really great what the children and young people have put on their feet," said Reverend Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammer with card tricks and other art pieces surprised.
Jürgen Sator leaves the NRW board
The head of the Essen panel, Jörg Sartor, has resigned from frustration over criticism from his own ranks.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essen table had introduced a recording stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned as vice president of the NRW panels in July, Sartor told the "World on Sunday".
Too many fell in my back.
The head of the Tafeln-Landesverband NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed his understanding of the decision of his longtime deputy.
The harsh criticism took Sartor with him.
"I can understand his step - there have been people who didn't know exactly why the Essen table is doing that."
However, Sartor is still active for the Essen table - "six days a week, nothing changes," Weilerswist said.
Sartor once again criticized colleagues from other boards in the "World on Sunday".
One must not follow the approach, "without us, the people in the city starve."
It is up to the state to ensure that people do not starve.
The Essener did not attend a congress of the panels on Friday in Berlin.
"I'm told too much sweet shit," he said.
There are all these social fuzzies that criticized me that way at the time.
SF Lorch play 2-0 lead - Gmünder Tagespost
Football, district league Lorch loses against Neuler 2:3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after a gap - Bettringen beats Lauchheim clearly.
At 2:0 Lorch was already in the lead in the home game against the TV Neuler - at the end stood 2:3 and the disappointment with the sports friends was great.

Gladbach Plays Twice Guided Tour - Schalke without Embolo with First Victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach has to wait for an away win in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2, the foals play a lead twice.
Schalke comes against Mainz for the first win of the season (1:0).
(sda) Four times in the first five league games, Schalke has maneuvered away with early opponents.
Now the team of Domenico Tedesco once again demonstrated the strength with which it had taken first place behind Bayern in the last season.
Alessandro Schöpf led the home team in the eleventh minute after strong preparation by Jewgeni Konopljanka by head, as a result the hosts preserved the mini cushion with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund greets new from the top of the Bundesliga.
The team of Lucien Favre had settled against Bayer Leverkusen until the break a 0:2 gap, but in the second half came the 4:2 victory.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65th) and Marco Reus (69th) equalled with a doublette within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, provided with another doublette in the final phase (86th/94th) for the crowning conclusion of the performance increase after the break.
The first victory was also the VfB Stuttgart.
Werder Bremen, who had already been decimated before the break for a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic, had to fear in the meantime.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive goalie Ron-Robert Zieler produced a curious throw-in owner that helped the guests in the 68th minute to compensate.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not have a successful, but failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbachers, who joined the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang twice gave a guided tour, ultimately played 2:2 and are still waiting for an away victory in the VW city since 2003.
Renato Steffen was in charge of Wolfsburg's 1:1 compensation with his second federal ligator.
Yann Sommer was powerless at the flat shot from 20 meters of the Aargauer, as was the second encounter after an hour.
Nevertheless, the trends at Gladbach are quite promising.
Alassane Pléa turns out to be a goalkeeper in the storm of the foals.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record purchase by OGC Nice hit for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in the seventh mandatory game.
After seven laps, Gladbach finished fourth.
Within 40 minutes, the previously unbeaten Werder Bremen maneuvered against the VfB Stuttgart into an uncomfortable position.
After 19 minutes, Florian Kohlfeldt’s team was surprised by a Stuttgarter Konter, which the ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis finished with his first season hit, after 36 minutes, Milos Veljkovic continued to join his team: the 23-year-old Serbe cashed after a jersey-tip match against Daniel Didavi Yellow-Red.
Although Stuttgart's defenders Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremer back to the game by a curious throw-in owner (68th), a quarter of an hour before the end Gonzalo Castro shot the over-acting Stuttgarters back on the Siegesstrasse.
Nuremberg decided the duel against Düsseldorf 3-0 sovereignly.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens already brought the home team on course with the help of Foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state names
Today, around 1.8 million people in Macedonia are voting on whether to change their country’s name in North Macedonia.
In the event of a yes, the almost three decades of conflict with the neighbouring Greece could be resolved.
Athens had insisted on a name change because of its eponymous northern province and blocked any approach of Macedonia to the West.
Voters will therefore also decide on the future of Western integration.
The U.S. had announced that the country could quickly become a NATO member in the event of a positive outcome of the referendum.
Syrians in U-Haft.
Refugees attacked three women.
One Syrian brutally beat three pensioners and hurt them in part.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had ransacked in Alsergrund on Friday at around 10 p.m.
When the police arrived, they spoke to the accused, who, with his fists clenched on passers-by, tried to attack them, on his behavior.
Then the Syrian tried to beat and kick the officials.
Shortly afterwards, it turned out that the suspect had hit three elderly ladies (65, 67, 75) with his fists on the W<0xC3><0xA4>hringer Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e near a tram stop.
He also kicked the trio with his feet.
Some of the pensioners were seriously injured.
They suffered from hematomas, bruises and concussion.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured "for an unknown cause", as the police said.
He was taken to the hospital and constantly monitored during treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave themselves the “Yes” on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership had not been considered for them, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
"If we get married, then right." He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a fiscal spokesman for the SPD-Bundestag faction and one of the speakers of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs had aroused outrage on 30 June 2017.
For example, he had accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of "stumbling" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said in reference to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the field of adoption law.
Garden day: 400 meters hedge cut
There was a lot of work ahead of the members of the Bürgervereinigung Kinderhaus and the Gesellschaft für Leprakunde.
Because around 400 meters of hedge around the gardens of the residents of the Pründnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the residents, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
“We are doing this to reduce costs,” said Walter Schröer, chairman of the Citizens’ Association.
And so much has accumulated.
Due to the hot summer we are late this time, but luckily it is now only a shape cut.
Because already in the spring the hedge has been shaved.
The breakfast always following at work also has a long tradition.
“They should all be at the same time,” said Walter Schröer.
World Championship in Rio: Hannes Aigner gets gold at the Canuslalom World Cup
The Augsburger Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the conclusion of the Canuslalom World Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old made a perfect run on Sunday on the Olympic track.
Two years ago, he had missed Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, had enough rides here on the complex and it has fit everything today," said the Olympic third of London 2012.
In the end, he threw his paddle away with joy and pulled both arms up victoriously - knowing that it would be enough for at least one medal.
After all, he had number four.
But the six remaining starters could not top his fable time of 89.69 seconds.
Second was the Czech Jiri Prskavec before the Russian Pawel Eigel.
The Gauting Police Inspectorate reports the first attempted burglary this fall in a single-family home.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - burglars want to take advantage of this again.
The Gauting Police Inspectorate reported yesterday the first attempted burglary of this autumn.
The fact that it remained on Königswieser Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e during the attempt at the single-family house is due to the alarm system.
It started when the perpetrators laid hands on Friday just before 8 p.m.
The burglars knew that the residents were not at home.
However, the alarm system surprised her so much that they took the escape without prey.
Notes to the PI Gauting, telephone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Pleite bei Hertha: Getting caught by reality: Bayern v Ajax demanded
The predicate is unbeatable: the defeat in Berlin does not want to be "failed" by FC Bayern.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim conclusion for Niko Kovac’s term of office.
The first small performance level under the new coach Niko Kovac is not expected to increase to a higher autumnal depth for the Munich people.
“One week ago, we felt like we were invincible.
Now we’ve gotten a bit of reality,” Thomas Müller stated after the deserved 0:2 defeat at Hertha BSC and called for a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Those of us who know us know that this really upsets us and that's why we're giving gas to Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year, no goal was scored, as at the same time of the pre-season two compulsory games in series without a win, the table lead in the Bundesliga lost to Borussia Dortmund for the time being.
Although the overall situation is far from as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record champion must be warned.
The FC Augsburg in the 1:1 with its run-intensive man-to-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful needlestrokes over the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days, as the last seeming overpowering Bayern are to crack.
“Those who know FC Bayern know that we won’t let that please us and we will do everything we can to be successful again,” Kovac said.
Otherwise, however, he dealt surprisingly gently with his losers in his hometown and pushed his first defeat as a Munich coach only on the once again inadequate handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would still leave the first interim conclusion of his term in office positive before the international game break - otherwise the tone is likely to be tightened.
For example, Kovac did not take any extraordinary measures before the second royal class appearance this season after the 2-0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation for the second preliminary round game against Ajax, which had also beaten AEK Athens in a 3-0 victory to the start.
"Now it has caught us in two games, but we're also going to make our goals again," announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
As already after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke mainly clear text.
The defender played the role of Mahner.
“I don’t think that’s all bad, we have to work it out again because we don’t make the many chances and make the mistakes behind,” the 23-year-old said shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, the Bayern were even behind Dortmund with five points, which has now taken the lead again with a point lead.
And so Kimmich, with a blink of an eye, valued at least positively that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has now come to an end.
"Yes, that's good," said the national player.
It's good for the league.
DFB boss in shooting line: <0xC3><0x96>zil-Causa: sharp attack by Erdogan on Grindel
Turkey’s President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees errors, but defends the association line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - On different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the authority of interpretation in the permanent fighting theme Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil.
After the Turkish President strongly criticized the handling of the former World Champion in Germany at the opening of the Great Ditib Mosque in Cologne, the DFB chief defended the association line.
In the early Sunday morning, the <0xC3><0x96>zil- personally sharply attacked Grindel announced consequences from the causa in the Mainz ZDF "Sports Studio".
“In the future, because we also have a lot of players with a migration background in the U-teams, we have to draw very precise conclusions that something like this does not repeat itself,” said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migration background as further integration officers.
At the same time, Grindel again stated that Erdogan was not in favour of the values of football and the DFB.
In sharp words, he had denounced racism against <0xC3><0x96>zil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil, born and raised in Germany, and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they took pictures with me in England,” Erdogan said in the cathedral town on Saturday.
To be honest, as their president, I could not digest the fact that our two young men, who have risen to the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that he felt "reasonably treated by the DFB" as opposed to <0xC3><0x96>zil after the World Cup affair, which had begun with Erdogan through photos of the two.
At the same time, he announced that he would like to introduce himself to players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I’m German, if I lose, I’m a migrant – that’s not possible.
“That he has such an impression, I am very sorry,” Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, I always said that.
However, he does not see a basis for <0xC3><0x96>zil’s return to the national team.
In addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon, an additional integration commissioner will now be appointed.
“If someone without a migration background has a clear impact on society and football and says, ‘The issue is important, we need to take care of that’, that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs where integration must work,” Grindel said.
Despite criticism of his person after the World Cup and the <0xC3><0x96>zil affair, he wants to run again for office as DFB president next year.
“I’m doing my job and trying to make them as good as I can,” Grindel said.
Year-old builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - As reported by the police, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10am and 1pm.
First, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red traffic light in the area of Lauter Höhe.
He told the pensioner that he had driven against her car.
There was no exchange of staff, however, as the 75-year-old could no longer find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, a phone call was received from the police about a driver who had come off the road and driven against a lead post.
The man did not want a police officer on the spot and then drove away.
After that, the Redeemer went home.
However, the pensioner has moved in his place of residence where he has lived for decades and rammed a construction vehicle when turning.
Eventually, the police could find and stop him.
His car suffered significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a confused impression and could not remember much more.
The damage is approximately 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Nearly 1,000 operational personnel are still in operation.
Around four weeks after the outbreak of the moor fire on a Bundeswehr site in Emsland, 980 emergency personnel are still engaged in the extinguishing work.
The Bundeswehr said this on Sunday.
As the situation continues to develop steadily, 70 volunteers were last withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of deployments is planned, it says.
On the night of Sunday, an above-ground fire had been discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the disaster had been lifted, which was declared well a week earlier on 21 September, because it was feared that the flames would put adjacent forests and settlements at risk by wind and spark flight.
On Thursday, it was said that the fire would no longer threaten neighbouring communities.
At times, more than 1,500 on-site personnel tried to get the big fire under control.
The Luftwaffe continues to support the work on the Bundeswehr test site at Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with drones of the Bundeswehr.
For the 2nd and 5th October, according to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "Tornados" are also planned.
The fire was triggered by test rockets fired by Airbus technicians.
The smoke flag of the moorbrand had temporarily moved up to a hundred kilometers far beyond the northwest of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr wants to set up a contact point that will receive damage reports.
Initial claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly one year after marriage came into force for all, the politician married his longtime friend in Hamburg.
The two have been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of marriage for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs has married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave themselves the “Yes” on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership had not been considered for them, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
When we get married, it's right.
He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a fiscal spokesman for the SPD-Bundestag faction and one of the speakers of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs had aroused outrage on 30 June 2017.
For example, he had accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of "stumbling" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said in reference to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the field of adoption law.
Referendum in Macedonia on new state names started
In Macedonia, the much-anticipated referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Around 1.8 million voters will decide whether their state will be called North Macedonia in the future.
This is due to its eponymous northern province of neighbouring Greece.
For almost three decades, Athens had blocked any approach from Skopje to the EU and NATO.
If the citizens vote yes, they also give the start for the Western integration of their country.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from forgetting
Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have turned 90 on September 30.
The 1986 Nobel Peace Prize laureate dies in the US in 2016 leaving behind a work that preserves the horrors of the Shoah for posterity.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The purpose of the register is to facilitate organ donation and relieve family members in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can continue to be taken only with explicit consent, Swisstransplant emphasizes.
(dpa) Switzerland will launch an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve loved ones in stressful situations.
People who wish to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be retrieved in case of need of Swisstransplant.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs – as in Germany – can continue to be taken only with explicit consent, Swisstransplant emphasizes.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donor card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of cases, a card is found at the crucial moment in the case of potential donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, the relatives do not know the desire of the deceased.
"You then have to decide by proxy in the sense of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," he said.
A similar registration system already exists in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on the possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokesperson for the Federal Center for Health Enlightenment, Marita Völker-Albert says.
“There is no register in which people can register their wishes – for or against organ donation,” she says.
Federal Minister of Health Jens Spahn has voted for a new regulation of organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would initially be considered an organ donor, unless he or his family disagreed.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in headcount
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is world champion in headcount.
On the weekend in Wolfsburg, he defeated 39 fellow contenders.
Martina Flamme-Jasper of the Phaeno Science Museum, the venue of the competition, said this on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grü<0xC3><0x9F> from Germany took third place.
The youngest World Cup participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old pensioner from France, as chief referee Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were, for example: 14,130,214 x 17,981,822 or 57,809,355 + 28 x 16,448,333.
Since spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, where participants met guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Grü<0xC3><0x9F> from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air when calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Two years ago, he was a 14-year-old in Bielefeld.
With terms like superbrain, genius, or wonder child, organizer Laue can start little.
“Headcounts can be trained,” he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even computational competitions in stages.
The disciplines include, for example, square root drawing from six-digit numbers.
When calculating versatility, candidates are given surprise tasks for which they need to quickly find a solution strategy.
Here, too, the Germans had good chances, said the chief referee.
Otherwise, Asians are often in favour because headcounts are learned more intensively in early childhood and with other, effective methods.
Intrusive Appeal: Video with Naked Serena Williams: Breast Cancer Early Detection
Tennis-Ass Serena Williams shows off her sensitive and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to point out breast cancer with this video and make himself strong for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings above without the song "I Touch Myself" from the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands cover her most intimate places.
Singer Chrissy Amphlett has died.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which is about breast cancer early detection that can save lives.
Serena Williams died almost a year ago.
At the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia there were complications.
An emergency surgery was initiated to save the baby’s life.
In a subsequent CT, blood clots in Serena’s lungs were discovered.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The federal government is planning a significant extension of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the Turkish-blue coalition will send an appropriate bill to the so-called "symbol law" in review.
This is intended to significantly extend the number of terrorist or comparable groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings snow to the mountains in the west
Mrs. Holle will be shaking her beds for the first time in the west next week: Polare Kaltluft will reach Vorarlberg, Nordtirol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute of Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit drops to 1,500 to 1,200 meters at the beginning of the week – in narrow valleys it can snow down to about 1,000 meters at high intensity, it said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, 20 to 40 centimetres of new snow can be expected above 2,000 metres.
On higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Gro<0xC3><0x9F>glockner Hochalpenstra<0xC3><0x9F>e) the road conditions become wintery.
Farmers are allowed to start the annual crack care on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein’s farmers are allowed to start their annual kink care on Monday.
The "green forests" unique in Germany have shaped the landscape of the low-forest federal state for about 200 years.
The tree and shrub hedges, which are up to five metres wide, are "Walderset" and for many animals and plants the last retreats.
Knicks combine habitats scattered as corridors, through which the exchange of organisms can still function, as the managing director of the German Nature Conservation Federation (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were built on the basis of an order from the Danish king Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field boundary and livestock fence, they also supplied the farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
From that time comes his name "Knick": By "turning" the branches, the dense, intertwined boundaries could develop.
Today, around 45,000 kilometres of hedges stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea and give the image of a wooded, diversely structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used by around 7000 animal species as a spare habitat.
In one kilometre of Knick, up to 1800 different species could live and breed up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, its ecologically important function can only be achieved if it is properly cared for in winter.
Otherwise, he succumbs to a light tree series that, in addition to biodiversity, also loses the wind protection effect, Ludwichowski said.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Knickpflege may only be operated outside the breeding season from October to March.
After Tsunami in Sulawesi Indonesian talks about situation on site
In an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND), the local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquake and tsunami:
Were you on site during the tsunami itself?
No, I was in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, as the airport on Palu was closed at that time.
What is the situation on the island?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all of which were completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living in Sulawesi now?
Many have run on surrounding hills, where they still stand out for fear of another tsunami and earthquake and where they have no access to water and food.
Some are standing in front of their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and also the gas stations are completely closed, people are partially stealing food and gasoline.
The public service is completely shut down, the national government is helping out.
A prison was also destroyed, the prisoners sometimes run around freely and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How does communication and information provision work on the island?
At the moment we have mobile phone reception, but this did not work before and we only got information via radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people who they don’t know if they are alive and where they are, because people were on the road not at home during the earthquake, but for example at work.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information about this?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many thought "okay, not a tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they ran to the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, not prepared for earthquakes?
There are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB has to give up Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will be missing from VfB Stuttgart with severe muscle injuries for a long time.
Aogo pulled a muscle fiber crack in the back left thigh at 2-1 against Werder Bremen on Saturday, the football leaguer announced on Sunday.
In Donis, doctors diagnosed a muscle bundle crack in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss games even after the next national game break.
The VfB Stuttgart did not make a forecast of the downtime.
A muscle bundle crack usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber crack usually heals a little faster.
Triumph of Hyperrealism at the San Seb<0xC3><0xA1>stian Film Festival
San Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n - The San Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n Film Festival closes the ranks of the most prestigious European festivals every year.
In spite of the cinema, it can be summed up: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.
After a convincing competition in Cannes, especially with strong contributions from Europe and Asia and a Venice that could attract a lot of attention with Oscar candidates from Hollywood, San Sebastian also delivered one of his best competitions of recent years.
On Sunday morning, the Olching Fire Department attempted to capture an injured duck.
However, the action continued for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - Walkers at Lake Olching noticed a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
She stayed in the area of the water station.
To help the animal, the passersby called the police and the fire department.
However, the first attempts to capture the duck went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to evade the forces again and again.
In the end, she fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the fire brigade was able to circle the animal and push it back to shore, where it was then put into a transport box after almost an hour by a firefighter with a hardened handle.
The duck injured in the chest was then taken to the animal clinic of the LMU in Oberschlei<0xC3><0x9F>heim.
But according to the first estimates, their chances of survival are rather low.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard points to World Cup medal
For a long time, Julian Eberhard, a biathlete at Olympia, was in his stomach.
In the coming winter, the Saalfeldener wants to catch up with the missing precious metal at the World Cup in <0xC3><0x96>stersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Pyeongchang Olympic sprint to grab the medal.
Seven tenths of a second were missing in the end on bronze.
“I consciously took the time to process this,” says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym fitness studio in his hometown Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top form, but it just didn’t want to be.
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to catch up with the missing precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to come back to a big event with the constitution, to win something.
At some point you also have to hit.
Eberhard (SWE) is the winner of the World Championships in <0xC3><0x96>stersund: "I have already closed the track in my heart", he remembers with pleasure his fourth World Cup place in the individual race last year.
Immediately after Olympia, he celebrated the only single win for Austria in the last World Cup winter in the Kondiolahti (FIN) mass-launching competition.
He finished second with the season in Oslo (NOR).
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation into turbo-tempo
The time is extremely short and the number of planned interrogations is severely limited.
With an FBI investigation at the turbo-tempo, Republicans in the U.S. Senate want to secure the ultra-thin majority for the controversial judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
President Donald Trump has set investigators a deadline until Friday to investigate the alleged incidents that have occurred more than 30 years ago.
The latest change in the drama about Kavanaugh’s vocation, accompanied by a cultural struggle, was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing by Kavanaugh and first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, during which the lawyer fired angry tirades against the opposition Democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee should pave the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative judge at the Supreme U.S. Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed assured when suddenly Senator Jeff Flake stated against his original announcement that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had described the heavy pretensions on Thursday as “deciding,” initially included further attacks against women and, on the contrary, spoke of “happiness in misfortune.”
In this way, last doubts could be eliminated, he said.
Later, Trump attacked the Democrats sharply in an election rally because they rejected Kavanaugh: “They are trying to block and destroy.”
Trump orders FBI investigation into Kavanaugh case
The White House has also extremely limited the powers of the investigators.
One will specifically investigate the known allegations of two women, more than that, a government official told the Wall Street Journal: “They don’t go on a fishing trip.”
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are expected to be heard.
The mobile radar device installed in a "civil vehicle" of the municipality of Ried for monitoring the speed limit is stationed on the Gartenstra<0xC3><0x9F>e from Monday, 1 October, according to the municipality.
There is also the Federal School Centre.
The municipality also operates several fixed-installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 to win against Mainz: Fear has been felt
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first season victory against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first win of the season.
Nevertheless, the factor time also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
This was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball in there.
And there were a lot of corners and a lot of balls in our penalty room," said Schalke's sports director 04 - and breathed up.
After all, the royal blues still managed to bring the barely 1-0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first victory of the season under the roof and compartment.
In fact, it could have been different.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11th of the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco had given Tedesco security: "Overall, the first half was good, both playful and pressing", with increasing playing time, obviously more and more the head played a role.
Don't actually create a headball monster
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me," said Heidel, "if the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore retreated further and further.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three counts of the season.
“We all fell a huge stone from the heart,” said Schöpf, who had no insignificant part in it with his headball hit: “I’m actually the worst headball player in man’s creation.”
But in the end, only victory counts.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
“We wanted to start at the beginning and make a firework out of it,” said Schalke’s head coach.
Victory was important.
Finally, we can look forward to a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played intelligently, calmly and courageously, so we have to tackle games over 90 minutes
Probably the biggest shortcoming of the afternoon: royal blue missed the opportunity to worry about clearer conditions.
The possibilities were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice hit the latte 59/72 or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been a tremor win," Tedesco said, "you've already felt the fear a little bit."
I am glad that we won.
He was not the only one.
Fischbachau: Smoke column in the Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke was not to be overlooked.
From about two kilometers away, a hiker in the Leitzachtal on Sunday at around 1.30 p.m. observed a fire.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - The cause soon found out the police and fire department: an unknown person had lit garbage on a two square meters area on the Gschwendner Berg.
According to police, it appeared that he had been monitoring the fire for a long time, but then left the glow unattended.
This is near the forest.
30 Fischbachauer firefighters were busy pulling apart and extinguishing.
Police are now investigating for arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at eye level
Before them is the author, Professor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has repeatedly followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have been tasked with bringing interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treff" - the association that cooperates with the "Culture Policy" alliance in the organisation of the evening.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very easily, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the topic in an understandable way.
With a lot of gestures, tangible numbers and the one or the other joke, he brings listeners closer to one of the most conflicting topics: migration and integration.
Why do conflicts arise despite successful integration?
The Syrian author uses the answer to the question of a metaphor.
The German society sits at a table, the first-generation migrants at the cat table.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to decide.
This leads to conflicts.
Therefore, it is not decisive whether one is politically right or left-wing, but: "Am I for or against an open society?" he emphasizes.
In the beginning, more and more behavior, then more and more reigning the round of discussions begins.
And there is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective that two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani is on stage, not on stage, a symbol of the discussion: it is on par.
The sociology professor does not push his opinion, stressing that he is talking about the average, not about individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the topic, because "first when we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," El-Mafaalani says.
Even during the subsequent signing session, he still has an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, during prepared Kurdish specialties, he was intensively discussed further.
Basketball: Bonn and Gie<0xC3><0x9F>en win start-up games
The Giessen 46ers and the Telekom Baskets Bonn have finished the first day of the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and an away win.
Gie<0xC3><0x9F>en competed in a hard-fought match in his own hall with 91:84 (43:46) against the Central German BC.
The ambitious Bonners won at the BG Göttingen with 86:79 (49:47).
The first leader of the season is Alba Berlin after the 112:55 gala on Saturday against Science City Jena.
At the beginning of the new season, the German champions Bayern Munich and the former series champion Brose Bamberg had much more trouble.
Munich struggled on Friday to a 83:77 at ratiopharm Ulm, Bamberg won the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg on Saturday with 84:80.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The demand is apparently huge: over 100 interested parties have applied to buy one of the land in Landsham-Süd.
The municipality of Plining has sold the first plots of land in the new Landsham-Süd area on the free market.
Mayor Roland Frick said.
In addition, the application phase has been completed for the 20 properties offered by the municipality on more favourable terms or prices - similar to the previous local model.
More than 100 applications have been received, according to Frick.
"Currently the documents are examined", with regard to the application criteria, completeness and correctness.
According to the mayor of Plieninger, the goal is to have the candidate rankings for the 20 land plots prepared by the end of the year and to submit them to the municipal council.
After that, the award could be made.
In total, 50 plots of land for single and double-family houses and four plots for multi-family houses with an estimated eight residential units are being created on the land in the south of Landsham.
The development is now almost complete, and the roads and roads will soon be paved.
A single property as well as two of the multi-family houses belong to a private individual, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells the majority in the free market, 20 plots of land in the socially-compatible model.
According to Frick, the two multi-family houses of the municipality are to be built as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 income-oriented apartments funded by the Free State.
Room for 200 people
Roughly estimated, living space for about 200 people is created on the surface of the new Landsham-Süd area.
Not only that: Now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, there is the start for the new construction of a day care centre.
It will accommodate three kindergarten and three crib groups as well as a multi-purpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, the start of the next kindergarten year.
Schalke's Naldo "big sport" also succeeds on the bench
For the third time in a row, not in the starting team: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues, for the third time in a row, had sat not in the Schalker Startelf, but on the exchange bench, the understanding of many people would have been great if the almost two-meter-large Brazilian had really talked about the frustration of the soul.
But when the Schalker players gathered in the middle circle as usual after the 1-0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05 and thanked head coach Domenico Tedesco for all his pros, the 36-year-old, who all call himself Naldo for simplicity, turned up and said, "We have to thank you, coach!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction of his vice-captain, who, despite his reservist existence, had no resentment.
Naldo, who was celebrated last season as the best shawler, probably knows that he actually didn’t get on the track with his coach – but gets a break for good reason.
A reason called "load control".
It was not easy to tell him.
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I'm telling you honestly," Tedesco told Naldo about the moment he said he wasn't in the starting eleven.
He is an important player, he is an important person.
But it’s always about the thing, it’s about the club,” Tedesco explained.
Naldo played against Bayern and Porto for 90 minutes.
He is 36 years old.
It is important that everyone is able to sniff through at the moment.
And that we all keep in the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation, which last also caught Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also proving himself on the bench as an exemplary team player.
In August, the mood in Austria’s industry continued its descent in comparison to the Eurozone.
The purchasing manager index (PMI) was at a 37-month low with 46.7 points.
Europe-wide, Austria still has the third best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute announced on Monday its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the PMI of the euro zone rose by 1.1 to 45.1 points, so the index is still the 13th consecutive month under the brand of 50 meters, indicating growth.
Only Ireland’s industry cracked this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
Finally, the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer declined, but slower than in the previous months.
In Spain, with 44.0 points, the index reached the highest level since March.
“The slightly weakened descent could mean that the worst has survived,” said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
However, the industry remains the number one growth brake in the third quarter anyway.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: the export orders in the euro area were no longer as strong as they had been since November 2011.
The companies therefore took off positions for the seventh consecutive month.
Industrial production also fell more strongly in China in August than initially assumed.
The mood barometer dropped from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.

Nice coach Thomas Tuchel continues from victory to victory with Paris Saint-Germain in France's football championship.
At OGC Nice, the defending champion won 3-0 (1-0) thanks to two hits from Superstar Neymar and was thus also successful in the eighth league game.
Recently, Olympique Lyon had made such a good start to the season in France 82 years ago.
Brazilian Neymar led PSG after 22 minutes and finished in the playoffs.
Christopher Nkunku (46th) made the interim 2-0.
Thus, Paris also passed the general test for the groundbreaking second Champions League group match against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
To kick off the royal class, Tuchel’s team had to accept the only mandatory game defeat so far this season at 2:3 in Liverpool.
